Based on the provided Java code, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the list of sinks in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ActivityManagerService var101 = this.mAm;",
      "PackageManagerInternal var103 = var101.getPackageManagerInternalLocked();",
      "ResolveInfo var105 = var103.resolveService(param2,param4,var100,var19,param7);"
    ],
    [
      "IntentFirewall var421 = var420.mIntentFirewall;",
      "ComponentName var422 = var408.name;",
      "ApplicationInfo var423 = var408.appInfo;",
      "boolean var425 = var421.checkService(var422,param2,param7,param6,param4,var423);"
    ],
    [
      "AppOpsManager.permissionToOpCode(var434);",
      "AppOpsService var439 = var438.mAppOpsService;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

1. The first set of instructions involves accessing the `PackageManagerInternal` instance and resolving a service using the `resolveService` method. This could potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive information about installed services.

2. The second set of instructions involves checking if a service is allowed to be accessed by a particular package using the `checkService` method of the `IntentFirewall`. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions on service access.

3. The third set of instructions involves converting a permission string to an opcode using the `permissionToOpCode` method and accessing the `AppOpsService`. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform sensitive operations related to app ops.

I have ranked these sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on system security. The first sink is the most sensitive as it involves accessing sensitive information about installed services, while the third sink is the least sensitive as it only involves converting a permission string to an opcode and accessing the `AppOpsService`, which may not have significant security implications in this context.

Note that these sinks are potential vulnerabilities and should be reviewed further to determine their actual impact on system security.
