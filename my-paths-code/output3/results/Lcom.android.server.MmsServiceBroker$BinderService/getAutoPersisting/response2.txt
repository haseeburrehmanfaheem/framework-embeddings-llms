To determine the access control level for the `getAutoPersisting` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getAutoPersisting` method involves calling `MmsServiceBroker.-$$Nest$mgetServiceGuarded(this.this$0)` to obtain an instance of `IMms`, and then it calls `getAutoPersisting()` on this instance to retrieve a boolean value. This indicates interaction with a service that might require specific permissions or access levels.

2. **Path Analysis**: Both paths (with depths) show similar patterns of obtaining the `IMms` service and then calling methods on it, suggesting a consistent approach in handling the service interactions. The difference in the second path at depth 2 doesn't affect the overall interaction with `getAutoPersisting()` since it still returns an instance of `IMms`.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets involve getting the guarded service and calling `getAutoPersisting()` on it, which aligns with the method's purpose.

4. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`addMultimediaMessageDraft` and `setAutoPersisting`) have a similarity score of 1.0 with `getAutoPersisting`, indicating they share significant functionality or structure.
   - These APIs are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically indicates that the API can only be called by system apps or apps with a specific signature, suggesting these operations require elevated permissions.

Given this analysis:

- The method interacts with a guarded service (`IMms`), indicating it might deal with sensitive data or functionality.
- Similar APIs are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggesting they require system or signature-level permissions to execute securely.

Therefore, based on the interaction with potentially sensitive services and the precedent set by similar APIs, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `getAutoPersisting`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
