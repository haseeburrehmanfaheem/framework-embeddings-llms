To determine the access control level for the `addTextMessageDraft` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet**: The method `addTextMessageDraft` involves interacting with an `IMms` service through `MmsServiceBroker`. It uses a guarded service, which implies some form of protection or permission checking.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `addMultimediaMessageDraft`: This API has a high similarity score (0.9612409472465515) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The method involves adding a multimedia message draft, which is somewhat similar to adding a text message draft in terms of interacting with the MMS service.
   - `importMultimediaMessage`: With a similarity score of 0.834735095500946, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It imports a multimedia message, which involves interaction with the MMS service but includes more parameters such as URI, string, and boolean values.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that interactions with the MMS service (like adding or importing messages) require system or signature-level permissions. This is because these operations can potentially access or modify sensitive data (e.g., message content, sender/receiver information), which necessitates stricter access controls to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

**Conclusion**: Based on the similarity in functionality and the access control levels of the provided APIs (`addMultimediaMessageDraft` and `importMultimediaMessage`), it's reasonable to conclude that the `addTextMessageDraft` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized components (those with system or signature-level permissions) can add text message drafts, thereby protecting user data and preventing potential security vulnerabilities.
