To determine the access control level for the `sendMessage` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The `sendMessage` method involves several steps, including adjusting a URI for user and grant permission, getting an `IMms` service, and then calling `sendMessage` on that service. This process includes interactions with system services and permissions management.

2. **Similar APIs**: A similar API is mentioned, `downloadMessage`, which has a similarity score of 0.9436665773391724. This high similarity suggests that the two methods share significant functionality or operational characteristics. The access control level for `downloadMessage` is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - **NONE**: No specific permissions required.
   - **NORMAL**: The API can be invoked by any app without special permissions, but it might still enforce some restrictions based on the app's identity or user interactions.
   - **DANGEROUS**: The API can pose a risk to the user's privacy or device security and typically requires explicit user consent or specific dangerous permissions declared in the app's manifest.
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: This level indicates that the API is intended for system use or apps that are signed with the same certificate as the system, implying a higher level of trust and privilege.

Given the information:

- The `sendMessage` method interacts closely with system services (`MmsServiceBroker`, `UriGrantsManagerInternal`, etc.) and manages permissions.
- It has a highly similar API (`downloadMessage`) that is classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that both methods may require or interact with system-level functionalities or sensitive data.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the `sendMessage` method also requires a level of trust and privilege akin to system apps or those signed with the platform's certificate due to its interaction with sensitive services and permissions management. Therefore, the access control level for `sendMessage` should be consistent with that of its similar API, `downloadMessage`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
