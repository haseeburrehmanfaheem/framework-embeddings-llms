To determine the access control level for the `deleteStoredMessage` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `deleteStoredMessage` API has two paths, both with a depth of 2. In both paths, it calls the `getServiceGuarded` method, which returns an instance of `IMms`. This instance is then used to call the `deleteStoredMessage` method.

The sink code for this API is:
```java
IMms v4 = MmsServiceBroker.-$$Nest$mgetServiceGuarded(this.this$0);
boolean v5 = v4.deleteStoredMessage(p1, p2);
return v5;
```
This code snippet is similar to the ones found in the provided similar APIs: `updateStoredMessageStatus` and `deleteStoredConversation`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The similarity scores between `deleteStoredMessage` and these APIs are high (0.8951582312583923 and 0.8770543932914734, respectively), indicating that they share similar functionality and code structures.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the `deleteStoredMessage` API should have a similar access control level to the provided similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `deleteStoredMessage` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
