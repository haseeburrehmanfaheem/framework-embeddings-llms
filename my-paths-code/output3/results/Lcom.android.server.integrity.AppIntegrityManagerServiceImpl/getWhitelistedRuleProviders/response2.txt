To assign an access control level to the `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method returns a list of whitelisted rule providers. It directly calls another method named `getAllowedRuleProviderSystemApps` and returns its result.

2. **Analyzing `getAllowedRuleProviderSystemApps`**:
   - This method fetches a string array from resources with the ID `17236075`.
   - However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided code snippet for this method. Initially, it suggests converting a string array (`v2`) into a list (`v3`), but then it introduces an empty `ArrayList` (`v3`) and iterates over it without adding any elements from `v2`. The return statement is supposed to return `v3`, which would be an empty list due to the confusion in the code logic provided.
   - Despite this, the intent appears to be retrieving a predefined list of system apps allowed as rule providers.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets suggest that the method's result (`List v1`) is directly returned and also implies an empty `ArrayList` is created and returned in another part of the logic.
   - This indicates the method does not perform any critical operations like network access, file I/O, or database queries but rather deals with returning predefined data.

4. **Comparing with Similar APIs**:
   - **`getDvbDeviceList()`**: Has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also returns a list but is marked as requiring system or signature-level permission, possibly due to its interaction with system resources or configuration.
   - **`getCurrentRuleSetVersion()`**: Has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it does not require any special permissions. It interacts with rule providers and checks for emptiness but doesn't seem to perform sensitive operations.

Given these points:
- The method primarily deals with returning a predefined list without interacting with sensitive resources or performing dangerous operations.
- Its similarity with other APIs suggests that while some system-level interactions might be involved (like fetching allowed rule provider system apps), the nature of the data returned and the operations performed do not seem to warrant high-level permissions like `DANGEROUS` or even `SYS_OR_SIG`, considering the comparison with `getCurrentRuleSetVersion()` which has an access control level of `NONE`.

**Conclusion**: The method does not involve sensitive operations that would typically require special permissions. However, its interaction with system resources (e.g., fetching allowed rule providers) might suggest a need for some form of access control beyond `NONE`. Given the information and comparisons provided, assigning it an access control level similar to `NORMAL` seems appropriate, considering standard practices around accessing system configuration or resources that are not directly sensitive user data. However, without explicit details on the nature of "whitelisted rule providers" and their impact on system security or privacy, we lean towards the least restrictive option provided in the context that still acknowledges some level of access control might be warranted for such operations.

Therefore, considering the options provided (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), and based on the analysis above:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice reflects a balanced approach between ensuring system security and acknowledging that not all methods require the most restrictive access controls. However, it's crucial to note that specific platform or application requirements might dictate otherwise, and this assessment is based on the information provided in the scenario.
