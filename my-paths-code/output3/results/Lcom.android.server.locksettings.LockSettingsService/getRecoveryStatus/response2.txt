To assign an access control level to the `getRecoveryStatus` method, we need to consider the semantics of the method and its interactions with other components.

The `getRecoveryStatus` method returns a map containing recovery status information. It calls `checkRecoverKeyStorePermission` which registers a recovery agent, and `getStatusForAllKeys` which retrieves key statuses from a database based on the caller's UID.

Considering the code snippet and the similar API `setRecoveryStatus`, we can observe that:

1. The method interacts with sensitive data (recovery status) and checks permissions using `checkRecoverKeyStorePermission`.
2. The similar API `setRecoveryStatus` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission.
3. The `getRecoveryStatus` method does not modify any sensitive data but only retrieves information.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the `getRecoveryStatus` method should have a similar access control level to `setRecoveryStatus`, as both methods interact with sensitive recovery status data.

However, since `getRecoveryStatus` is a read-only operation and does not modify any sensitive data, it might be considered less critical than `setRecoveryStatus`. Nevertheless, given the similarity in functionality and the need to protect sensitive recovery status information, we should assign an access control level that ensures only authorized parties can access this information.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for the `getRecoveryStatus` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the protection level of similar APIs that interact with sensitive data.

The final answer is: 

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
