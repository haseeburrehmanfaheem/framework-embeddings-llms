Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `requireStrongAuth` method as follows:

1. The method calls `p0.checkWritePermission(p2)`, which suggests that it is performing a permission check. This is similar to the `userPresent(I)V` API, which also calls `p0.checkWritePermission(p1)` and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. The method also calls `this.mStrongAuth.requireStrongAuth(p1, p2)`, which is similar to the `registerStrongAuthTracker(Landroid/app/trust/IStrongAuthTracker;)V` API that calls `this.mStrongAuth.registerStrongAuthTracker(p1)`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

3. The method uses a handler to send a message, which is also similar to the `registerStrongAuthTracker(Landroid/app/trust/IStrongAuthTracker;)V` API.

Considering these similarities and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is likely that the `requireStrongAuth` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
