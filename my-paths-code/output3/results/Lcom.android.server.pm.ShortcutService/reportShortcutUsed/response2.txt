Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `reportShortcutUsed` method to determine its access control level.

The `reportShortcutUsed` method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them call `verifyCaller` and `throwIfUserLockedL` methods, which are also present in the similar APIs. The `verifyCaller` method checks if the caller is verified, and the `throwIfUserLockedL` method checks if the user is unlocked.

The similar API `removeDynamicShortcuts` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and a similarity score of 1.0, which means it is very similar to the `reportShortcutUsed` method. The `enableShortcuts` API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and a similarity score of 0.9302960634231567, indicating a high degree of similarity.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is likely that the `reportShortcutUsed` method also requires a similar level of access control. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level indicates that the method can only be called by system or signature-protected applications, which suggests that the method performs sensitive operations that require elevated privileges.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the `reportShortcutUsed` method and its similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for this method is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-protected applications can call the `reportShortcutUsed` method, which helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive shortcut usage data.
