Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method has a similarity score of 1.0000001192092896 with the `enableShortcuts` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method may require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method has a similarity score of 0.9302960634231567 with the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method may require a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

The sink code provided also interacts with the `getPackageShortcutsForPublisherLocked` and `injectGetPackageUid` methods, which are similar to the methods called in the `enableShortcuts` and `removeDynamicShortcuts` APIs. This suggests that the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method may be performing similar operations that require a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Therefore, based on the similarity scores and the interactions with similar methods, I conclude that the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
