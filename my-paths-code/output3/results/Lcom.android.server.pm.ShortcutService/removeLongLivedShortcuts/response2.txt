To determine the access control level for the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method, we should consider the similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `disableShortcuts` and `removeDynamicShortcuts`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to shortcut management, especially those involving package shortcuts and user interactions, require a system or signature-level permission to ensure security and proper functioning.

Given the code snippets for `removeLongLivedShortcuts` and its similarities with `disableShortcuts` and `removeDynamicShortcuts`, it's evident that this method also deals with managing shortcuts at a level that requires protection against unauthorized access. The method involves verifying the caller, checking if the user is locked, adjusting ranks of shortcuts, and notifying changes, which are all critical operations that should not be exposed to arbitrary applications without proper clearance.

Therefore, considering the similarities in functionality and security requirements with `disableShortcuts` and `removeDynamicShortcuts`, it's logical to assign a similar access control level to `removeLongLivedShortcuts`.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" \}}$
