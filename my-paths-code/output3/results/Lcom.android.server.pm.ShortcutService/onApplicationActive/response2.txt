Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `onApplicationActive` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onApplicationActive` method interacts with sensitive data, such as shortcut packages and user files, and performs operations like resetting rate limiting and saving user data. The method also calls other methods that check the caller's system status and enforce reset throttling permissions.

The similar APIs, `removeDynamicShortcuts` and `hasShareTargets`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require either system or signature-level permission to access sensitive data.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `onApplicationActive` method, it is likely that the `onApplicationActive` method also requires a similar level of access control. The method's interactions with sensitive data and its enforcement of reset throttling permissions suggest that it should have a higher access control level than `NONE` or `NORMAL`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude that the access control level for the `onApplicationActive` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it requires system or signature-level permission to access and modify sensitive data.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
