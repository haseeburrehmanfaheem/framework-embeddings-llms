To determine the access control level for the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `removeDynamicShortcuts` method has two main parts:

1. Verifying the caller: `p0.verifyCaller(p1, p3);`
2. Removing dynamic shortcuts: 
   - Getting package shortcuts for the publisher: `ShortcutPackage v4 = p0.getPackageShortcutsForPublisherLocked(p1, p3);`
   - Ensuring immutable shortcuts are not included with IDs: `v4.ensureImmutableShortcutsNotIncludedWithIds(p2, 1);`
   - Adjusting ranks: `v4.adjustRanks();`
   - Notifying package shortcuts changed: `p0.packageShortcutsChanged(v4, phiInstruction, phiInstruction);`

The similar APIs provided are:

- `reportShortcutUsed`: This method also verifies the caller using `p0.verifyCaller(p1, p3);`, checks if the app is ephemeral using `boolean v6 = p0.isEphemeralApp(p1, p2);`, and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- `disableShortcuts`: This method gets package shortcuts for the publisher using `ShortcutPackage v4 = p0.getPackageShortcutsForPublisherLocked(p1, p5);`, ensures immutable shortcuts are not included with IDs using `v4.ensureImmutableShortcutsNotIncludedWithIds(p2, 1);`, adjusts ranks using `v4.adjustRanks();`, and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, which indicates that they require either system or signature-level permission to call. The code snippets for these APIs show similarities with the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method in terms of verifying the caller, getting package shortcuts, and adjusting ranks.

Given these similarities, it's reasonable to conclude that the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method should also have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
