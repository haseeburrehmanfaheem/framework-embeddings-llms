Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getBackupPayload` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getBackupPayload` method appears to be related to backing up shortcut data for a specific user. It checks if the caller is a system user (`enforceSystem()`), retrieves the user's shortcuts (`getUserShortcutsLocked(p1)`), saves the user's data internally (`saveUserInternalLocked(p1, v11, 1)`), and schedules a save operation for the user (`scheduleSaveUser(p1)`).

The similar APIs provided are `onBiometricError(III)V` and `onNotificationExpansionChanged(Ljava/lang/String;ZZI)V`, both with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs seem to be related to system-level operations, such as handling biometric errors or notification expansion changes.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `getBackupPayload` method, it appears that the `getBackupPayload` method is also performing a system-level operation. The fact that it checks if the caller is a system user (`enforceSystem()`) and performs internal saves and scheduling operations suggests that it requires a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the `getBackupPayload` method and its similar APIs, I conclude that the appropriate access control level for the `getBackupPayload` method is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
