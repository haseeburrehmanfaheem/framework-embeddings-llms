Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `hasShareTargets` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `hasShareTargets` method checks if a package has share targets, which is a relatively benign operation. It does not modify any data or perform any sensitive actions. The method also calls `throwIfUserLockedL` to check if the user is unlocked, which suggests that it is intended for use in a context where user locking is relevant.

The similar APIs provided, `onApplicationActive` and `disableShortcuts`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods perform more significant actions, such as resetting rate limiting or disabling shortcuts, which may require higher privileges. However, the fact that they are similar to `hasShareTargets` suggests that they may share some common characteristics or requirements.

Given the relatively benign nature of the `hasShareTargets` method and its similarity to other APIs with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is likely that `hasShareTargets` should have a similar access control level. However, since `hasShareTargets` does not perform any sensitive actions, it may not require the same level of privilege as the other APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `hasShareTargets` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This access control level reflects the relatively low risk and benign nature of the `hasShareTargets` method, while also acknowledging its similarity to other APIs with higher privilege requirements.
