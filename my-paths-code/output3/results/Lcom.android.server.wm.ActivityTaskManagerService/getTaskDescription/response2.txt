To determine the access control level for the `getTaskDescription` API, we should consider the semantics of the API, the sinks it interacts with, and the access control levels of similar APIs.

The `getTaskDescription` API is used to retrieve the description of a task given its ID. The API calls `enforceTaskPermission("getTaskDescription()")`, which suggests that it enforces a specific permission related to tasks. This implies that the API is handling sensitive information and should have a certain level of access control.

The sink code provided shows that the API interacts with `anyTaskForId` and `getTaskDescription` methods, which are related to task management. The similar APIs provided, `getFocusedRootTaskInfo` and `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that APIs related to task management and retrieval of sensitive task information should have a high level of access control.

Given the similarity in functionality and the fact that the API enforces a specific permission, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getTaskDescription` API should have an access control level similar to the similar APIs provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }}$
