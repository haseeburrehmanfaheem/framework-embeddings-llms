To determine the access control level for the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method, we need to analyze its code paths, interactions with sinks, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided API, `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay`, interacts with several methods across different depths, but the critical part of its functionality revolves around retrieving task information. It calls `ActivityTaskManagerService.enforceTaskPermission("getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay()")` which suggests a permission check related to task management. However, it's crucial to note that the actual enforcement mechanism seems to be deprecated or not fully implemented as indicated by `Slog.w("ActivityTaskManager", "MANAGE_ACTIVITY_STACKS is deprecated, please use alternative permission: MANAGE_ACTIVITY_TASKS")`.

Despite this deprecation notice, the method still retrieves and returns task information. The key sink code involves retrieving an `ArrayList` of root task infos from `mRootWindowContainer` based on a display parameter (`p1`). This operation could potentially expose sensitive information about the system's current state (e.g., running tasks).

Comparing this with the similar API `getAllRootTaskInfos()Ljava/util/List;`, which has a similarity score of 0.8376497030258179, we find that it also retrieves task information but does so without specifying a display (`-1` is used as the parameter). This similar API is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these considerations:

- The method's interaction with potentially sensitive system information (task states).
- The deprecation notice on the permission check, suggesting that while the current permission model might not be fully enforced, there's an acknowledgment of the need for some form of access control.
- The similarity to another API (`getAllRootTaskInfos`) which is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Therefore, considering these factors and the provided information about similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it deals with system-level information that could potentially require signature or system-level permissions to access securely.
