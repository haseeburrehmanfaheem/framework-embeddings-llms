Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getRootTaskInfo` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getRootTaskInfo` method has a similarity score of 0.993352472782135 and 0.9889705181121826 with the `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay(III)Landroid/app/ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo;` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `getRootTaskInfo` method is likely to require a similar access control level.

Upon reviewing the code snippets provided for the `getRootTaskInfo` method, I notice that it calls `ActivityTaskManagerService.enforceTaskPermission("getRootTaskInfo()")`, which enforces a task permission. However, the comment in the `enforceTaskPermission` method suggests that the `MANAGE_ACTIVITY_STACKS` permission is deprecated and recommends using the `MANAGE_ACTIVITY_TASKS` permission instead.

Considering the similarities with the `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay(III)Landroid/app/ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo;` API and the enforcement of task permission, I conclude that the `getRootTaskInfo` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
