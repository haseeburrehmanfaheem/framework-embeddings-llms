To determine the access control level for the `getPackageScreenCompatMode` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `getPackageScreenCompatMode` method is used to retrieve the screen compatibility mode of a package. It calls `getPackageScreenCompatModeLocked` which interacts with the package manager to get the application info and then computes the compatibility mode.

Looking at the similar APIs:

1. `setPackageScreenCompatMode`: This API sets the screen compatibility mode for a package. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission. The similarity score with `getPackageScreenCompatMode` is 0.9079, suggesting a strong similarity between the two methods.

2. `getPackageAskScreenCompat`: This API retrieves whether a package asks for screen compatibility mode. Its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although its similarity score with `getPackageScreenCompatMode` is slightly lower (0.8653), it still indicates a significant resemblance in functionality and possibly required permissions.

Given the similarities between these APIs, especially considering their interactions with package management and compatibility modes, we can infer that accessing or modifying package screen compatibility information likely requires privileged access to prevent unauthorized changes or exposures of sensitive package information.

Therefore, based on the strong similarity with `SYS_OR_SIG` level APIs and the nature of its operations (interacting with package compatibility settings), it's reasonable to conclude that the `getPackageScreenCompatMode` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment aligns with the principle of least privilege and ensures that operations affecting package compatibility modes are properly restricted to system or signature-level permissions, thereby enhancing security and preventing potential misuse.
