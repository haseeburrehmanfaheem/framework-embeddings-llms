To assign an access control level to the `suppressResizeConfigChanges` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `suppressResizeConfigChanges` method modifies the `mSuppressResizeConfigChanges` field based on the input parameter `p1`. It also calls `WindowManagerService.boostPriorityForLockedSection()` and `WindowManagerService.resetPriorityAfterLockedSection()`, which are related to thread priority management. These operations do not directly interact with sensitive user data or perform dangerous actions like sending SMS, making calls, etc.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves boosting and resetting the priority of a thread, which is an internal system operation rather than a user-sensitive action.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `cancelTaskWindowTransition(I)V` and `setPackageAskScreenCompat(Ljava/lang/String;Z)V` both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations similar to what `suppressResizeConfigChanges` does, in terms of interacting with system services for thread priority management, are considered to require a system or signature level permission. The similarity score indicates these APIs are closely related in behavior and context to `suppressResizeConfigChanges`.

Given the above analysis:

- The method does not deal with user-sensitive data directly.
- It involves internal system operations (thread priority management).
- Similar methods have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating they require system-level permissions due to their interaction with system services.

Therefore, considering the semantics of the API and its similarity to other APIs that interact with system services for thread management, it's reasonable to assign a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
