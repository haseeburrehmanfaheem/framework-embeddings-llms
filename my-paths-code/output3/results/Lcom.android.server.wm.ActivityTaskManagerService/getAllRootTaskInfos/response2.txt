To determine the access control level for the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `getAllRootTaskInfos` involves several steps, including enforcing task permission, boosting priority for a locked section, retrieving all root task infos from `mRootWindowContainer`, resetting priority after the locked section, and restoring calling identity. The critical part here is `ArrayList v4 = this.mRootWindowContainer.getAllRootTaskInfos(-1);`, which suggests it's fetching information about all root tasks.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **API Name: getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay(I)Ljava/util/List;**: This API has a high similarity score (0.8376497030258179) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its functionality involves getting all root task infos on a specific display, which implies it requires system or signature-level permission due to its potential to access sensitive information about the device's displays and tasks.
   - **API Name: getFocusedRootTaskInfo()Landroid/app/ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo;**: With a similarity score of 0.8199061155319214, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It focuses on getting the root task info of the currently focused task, which again deals with sensitive task management information.

Given these points:

- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they handle sensitive system information that requires either system-level permission or signature-level permission (where the app must be signed with the same certificate as the system).
- The `getAllRootTaskInfos` method interacts closely with system components, such as `ActivityTaskManagerService` and `WindowManagerService`, and deals with task management at a root level, which is critical for system functionality and security.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's interaction with sensitive system components and its similarity to other APIs that require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that `getAllRootTaskInfos` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
