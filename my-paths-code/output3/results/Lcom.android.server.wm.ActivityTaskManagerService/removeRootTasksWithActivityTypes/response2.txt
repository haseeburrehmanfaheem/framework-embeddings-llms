To determine the access control level for the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` involves several key operations:
   - It calls `enforceTaskPermission`, which suggests that it is checking for a specific permission related to task management.
   - It interacts with `WindowManagerService` to boost and then reset priority, indicating a need to temporarily elevate the thread's priority for the operation.
   - The critical part of the method involves calling `this.mRootWindowContainer.removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes(p1);`, which directly affects the window container by removing tasks based on activity types.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code `this.mRootWindowContainer.removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes(p1);` is crucial as it shows the method's impact on system resources, specifically removing root tasks from the window container based on provided activity types. This operation has significant implications for task management and could potentially affect system stability or user data if misused.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes([I)V` has a high similarity score (0.8923709392547607) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also affects task management by removing tasks based on windowing modes, indicating that operations which significantly alter the state of system resources or tasks are considered sensitive.
   - The API `getAllRootTaskInfos()Ljava/util/List;` has a similarity score of 0.8039498925209045 and is also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although this method does not modify task states but rather retrieves information, its access control level suggests that even reading sensitive system information requires elevated permissions.

Given these points:
- The method's impact on system resources (removing tasks) and potential for misuse if not properly permissioned.
- The similarity with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their sensitivity in managing or accessing system task information.
- The call to `enforceTaskPermission`, which, despite the deprecation notice, indicates a need for specific permissions to perform this action.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's functionality, its potential impact on system stability and user experience, and the access control levels assigned to similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
