To determine the access control level for the `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - Two similar APIs are mentioned, both with a high similarity score (0.993352472782135 and 0.9889705181121826). Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code snippets provided for these similar APIs involve getting root task information, which aligns with the purpose of `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` method involves calling `enforceTaskPermission`, indicating that it checks for a specific permission related to task management.
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity`, which are related to managing the identity of the caller, typically used in IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to ensure that operations are performed with the correct permissions and identity.
   - The method also interacts with `WindowManagerService` for boosting priority during locked sections, suggesting it might be dealing with sensitive or time-critical operations.

3. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   - The sink code provided shows that the method retrieves `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo`, which could potentially contain sensitive information about tasks and their activities.
   - This retrieval is done through `this.mRootWindowContainer.getRootTaskInfo(p1, p2, p3)`, indicating it's accessing specific task information based on input parameters.

4. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   - Given that similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level and considering the nature of `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay`, which involves potentially sensitive operations (retrieving task info, enforcing permissions, managing caller identity), it suggests that this method should also be classified under a restrictive access control to protect against unauthorized access or misuse.
   - The involvement of task permission enforcement (`enforceTaskPermission`) further supports the need for a higher level of access control.

Based on these considerations and the fact that similar APIs are categorized as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` should have a similar access control level to protect sensitive information and ensure system integrity.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination is made considering the method's functionality, its similarity to other APIs with known access control levels, and the potential sensitivity of the information it handles.
