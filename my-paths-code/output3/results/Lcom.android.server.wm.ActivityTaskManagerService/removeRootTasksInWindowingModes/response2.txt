Based on the provided information, I will analyze the given API and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The API `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes([I)V` has three paths with a depth of 2. All paths call `ActivityTaskManagerService.enforceTaskPermission("removeRootTasksInWindowingModes()");`, which suggests that this method is enforcing some kind of permission or access control. Additionally, the method calls `this.mRootWindowContainer.removeRootTasksInWindowingModes(p1);`, which interacts with the `mRootWindowContainer` object.

The similar APIs provided are:

* `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes([I)V` with a similarity score of 0.8923709392547607 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with the `mRootWindowContainer` object.
* `setFocusedRootTask(I)V` with a similarity score of 0.8390274047851562 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although this API does not directly interact with the `mRootWindowContainer` object, it still has a high similarity score and the same access control level as the first similar API.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes([I)V` API should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
