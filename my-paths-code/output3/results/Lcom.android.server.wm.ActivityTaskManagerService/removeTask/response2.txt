Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeTask` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeTask` method interacts with the `anyTaskForId` and `removeTask` methods, which are also present in the similar API `moveTaskToRootTask`. Both methods modify task-related data and seem to require a certain level of privilege to perform their operations.

The similar API `moveTaskToRootTask` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that it requires system or signature-level permission to execute. Given the similarity between the two APIs, it is likely that the `removeTask` method also requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the similar API, I assign the following access control level to the `removeTask` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the fact that the `removeTask` method, like the similar API `moveTaskToRootTask`, appears to require system or signature-level permission to modify task-related data.
