To assign an access control level to the `setLockScreenShown` method, we need to analyze its interactions with sinks and compare them to similar APIs.

The `setLockScreenShown` method interacts with the following sinks:
- `this.mKeyguardShown = p1;`
- `Boolean v5 = Boolean.valueOf(p1);`
- `Message v6 = PooledLambda.obtainMessage(v3, this.mAmInternal, v5);`
- `ActivityTaskManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda11 v9 = new ActivityTaskManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda11(p0,p1,p2);`
- `WindowManagerService.boostPriorityForLockedSection();`
- `this.sThreadPriorityBooster.boost();`

The similar APIs provided are:
- `cancelTaskWindowTransition(I)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
- `setPackageAskScreenCompat(Ljava/lang/String;Z)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`

Both similar APIs have the same code snippets as the sinks in `setLockScreenShown`, specifically:
- `WindowManagerService.boostPriorityForLockedSection();`
- `this.sThreadPriorityBooster.boost();`

Given that the similar APIs (`cancelTaskWindowTransition` and `setPackageAskScreenCompat`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and share the same code patterns with `setLockScreenShown`, it suggests that `setLockScreenShown` should also be assigned a similar access control level.

Therefore, considering the interactions with sinks and the similarity with other APIs, the final access control level for the `setLockScreenShown` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
