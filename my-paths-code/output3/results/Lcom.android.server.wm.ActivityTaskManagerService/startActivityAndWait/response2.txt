To assign an access control level to the `startActivityAndWait` method, we must carefully review its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `startActivityFromGameSession` and `startVoiceActivity`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

1. **Analysis of Code Snippets**:
   - The `startActivityAndWait` method involves several steps, including asserting package matches with the calling UID, enforcing that the caller is not isolated, handling incoming users, obtaining an activity starter, and setting various parameters for the activity starter.
   - Both similar APIs (`startActivityFromGameSession` and `startVoiceActivity`) also deal with starting activities but have specific conditions or parameters (e.g., game session, voice interaction).
   - The use of `handleIncomingUser` in all three methods suggests a concern with user identification and possibly security or privacy.

2. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose any risk to the system or user data.
   - `NORMAL`: Used for methods that require some level of access control but are generally considered safe when used appropriately.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Applied to methods that can potentially harm the system or breach user privacy if misused.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Indicates that the method should only be accessible by system or signature applications, implying a high level of trust and security clearance.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both `startActivityFromGameSession` and `startVoiceActivity` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting they require a high level of security clearance to prevent misuse.
   - These methods, like `startActivityAndWait`, involve starting activities under specific conditions, which can be sensitive operations requiring elevated permissions.

4. **Decision**:
   - Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that both provided similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to infer that `startActivityAndWait` also requires a high level of security clearance.
   - The method's involvement with user handling, activity starting, and the setting of various parameters (some of which could be sensitive) further supports the need for restricted access.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the code snippets and the comparison with similar APIs, the `startActivityAndWait` method should have an access control level that reflects its potential sensitivity and the need to restrict its use to trusted applications. Therefore, the assigned access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
