To analyze this API and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, we break down the code step by step:

1. **Method Invocation**: The `onReceive` method is invoked with parameters `Context p1` and `Intent p2`.
2. **Object Creation**: Inside `onReceive`, an object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created. This creation follows one of the positive rules since it has naming similarity with elements within the API's context (`ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver`) and is created using data flow from the API parameters (`p0`, `p2`, and `p1`).
3. **Method Invocation on Created Object**: The `start()` method is invoked on the newly created object `v0`.

Given these observations, we can identify a potential sink related to the creation of the `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object and its subsequent method invocation. This follows the positive rule for object creation with data flow from API parameters.

Here's how this analysis translates into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v0 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v0.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This represents a coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink, with a clear data flow link between them: the creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its subsequent method invocation.
