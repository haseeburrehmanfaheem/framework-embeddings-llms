Based on the provided code for the API `onReceive`, I will analyze it to identify potential sinks according to the given positive and negative rules.

The code is as follows:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v0 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v0.start();
    return;
}
```

Here's the analysis:

- `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v0 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);` 
  - This instruction creates a new object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. The creation of this object has naming similarity with the surrounding context (`ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver`) and is created using data flow from the API parameters (`p0`, `p2`, `p1`). However, to directly link it as a sink related to the `onReceive` method, we need to establish if it's used in a way that could potentially expose sensitive information or if its creation directly influences other potential sinks.

- `v0.start();`
  - This invokes a method on the newly created object. The sensitivity of this operation depends on what `start()` does, which isn't shown here. If `start()` leads to operations that can be considered as sinks (e.g., accessing or modifying sensitive data), then it could contribute to identifying a sink.

Given the information and focusing strictly on the provided code snippet without additional context about what `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its `start()` method do, we identify one potential set of instructions that could collectively form a sink. This is based on object creation with data flow from API parameters and the subsequent invocation of a method on this object.

However, to adhere strictly to the format requested for identifying sinks and given that we don't have explicit evidence of sensitive operations being performed directly within this snippet (e.g., accessing/modifying fields with naming similarity to the API or directly returning values), our analysis will focus on what's explicitly provided:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v0 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
        "v0.start();"
    ]
]
}
```

This JSON represents the potential sink identified within the `onReceive` API, keeping in mind that a full assessment would require more context about the operations performed by `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its `start()` method.
