Since there are no parameters being processed, fields being accessed or updated directly related to the API name `removeImeSurface`, and no objects being created with data flow from potential API parameters, we will analyze the method invocation.

The method `obtainMessage` has a high naming similarity as it is invoked by an object `mHandler` which could be considered an auxiliary operation. The `sendToTarget` method does not have direct relation to `removeImeSurface`. However, considering the flow of data and potential sinks, we notice that:

- `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget` are part of a coherent set as they directly influence each other.

However, according to the negative rules, auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining an instance of a class or accessing context objects) should be excluded. In this case, `mHandler.obtainMessage(1060)` could be considered an auxiliary operation.

Given the provided code and applying the rules:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "Message v2 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1060);",
        "v2.sendToTarget();"
    ]
]
}
```
However, considering that `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget` are auxiliary operations in a broader sense (as they're not directly related to data processing or sensitive information handling specific to the API name), this might not perfectly fit as a sink under the strict definition provided. But since there's no other clear operation fitting the positive rules for sinks, we've listed it based on method invocation coherence and potential influence on system state, albeit with an understanding that its sensitivity might be low compared to operations directly handling sensitive data or parameters.

It is worth noting that the original task asked to rank sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive. In this case, there's only one set of instructions which could potentially be considered a sink, thus ranking isn't applicable in the traditional sense. However, it's crucial to consider the context and potential impact on system security or data handling when evaluating such operations.
