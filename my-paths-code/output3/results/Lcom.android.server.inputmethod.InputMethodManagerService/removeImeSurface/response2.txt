To determine the access control level for the `removeImeSurface` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of `removeImeSurface`**: The method sends a message to a handler with a specific code (1060) using `obtainMessage` and then calls `sendToTarget()` on it. This operation seems to be related to internal communication within the application or system, specifically concerning input methods (IME).

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **`removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync(Landroid/os/IBinder;)V`**: This method has a high similarity score with `removeImeSurface`. It performs a similar operation but takes an `IBinder` as a parameter and uses message code 1061. Its access control level is `NONE`.
   - **`scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout(I)V`**: Although this method has a lower similarity score compared to the first one, it's still relevant for understanding access control patterns. It schedules a timeout related to biometric authentication with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions due to its sensitive nature.

Considering these points:
- The operation performed by `removeImeSurface` is closely related to managing input method surfaces, which doesn't inherently require sensitive permissions or access to critical system resources.
- The similar API `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to IME surface management might not require elevated permissions.
- However, the involvement of a handler and message sending could imply some level of internal system interaction. Yet, given the context, it doesn't seem to necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` or even `DANGEROUS` permissions.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `removeImeSurface` would likely be `NONE`, as it aligns with the management of IME surfaces and does not appear to involve sensitive data or operations that would require higher levels of permission.
