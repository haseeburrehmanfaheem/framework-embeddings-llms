To determine the access control level for the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method sends a message to a handler with a specific what code (1061) and an `IBinder` object as its argument. This operation seems related to inter-process communication or handling asynchronous tasks within the application.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink involves obtaining a message from a handler and sending it to its target. This is a common pattern in Android for handling messages between threads, particularly when dealing with UI updates or asynchronous operations that need to interact with the main thread.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout(I)V**: This method has a high similarity score (0.9768016338348389) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its operation involves sending a message to a handler, similar to the target method.
   - **removeImeSurface()V**: With a similarity score of 0.9407423734664917, this method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It sends a message to a handler as well but without any arguments besides the what code.

Given these points, all methods seem to deal with sending messages through handlers for various purposes, including removing surfaces and scheduling timeouts. The fact that both similar APIs have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels suggests that operations involving sending messages through handlers might require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on the system's state or security.

Considering the semantics of these methods and their similarities in operation (all involve sending messages via handlers), it is reasonable to infer that the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method should also have a similar access control level. 

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
