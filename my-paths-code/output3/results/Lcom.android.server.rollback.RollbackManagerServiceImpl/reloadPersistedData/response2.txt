To assign an access control level to the `reloadPersistedData` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `reloadPersistedData` method creates a new instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` and passes it to the `awaitResult` method. The `awaitResult` method executes the lambda asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.runAsync` and waits for the result.

The sink code snippets indicate that the method interacts with the `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` instance and the `CompletableFuture` instance.

Now, let's compare this with the similar APIs:

1. `expireRollbackForPackage(Ljava/lang/String;)V`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9765657186508179 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code snippet is similar to the `reloadPersistedData` method, as it also creates a lambda instance and passes it to the `awaitResult` method.
2. `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9636512398719788 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code snippet is also similar, as it creates a lambda instance and passes it to the `awaitResult` method.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to execute. Given the similarities in code structure and functionality between these APIs and the `reloadPersistedData` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `reloadPersistedData` method should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the comparison with similar APIs, I assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to the `reloadPersistedData` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
