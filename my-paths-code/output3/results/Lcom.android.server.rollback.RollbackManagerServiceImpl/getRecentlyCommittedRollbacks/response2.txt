To determine the access control level for the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method, we should consider its code snippet, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method first checks if the current thread is not a worker thread using `assertNotInWorkerThread()`. Then, it enforces manage rollbacks permission with `enforceManageRollbacks("getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks")`. This implies that managing rollbacks requires specific permissions, indicating a level of sensitivity.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves creating an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8` and awaiting its result using `awaitResult(v2)`. This asynchronous operation suggests interaction with potentially sensitive data or operations related to rollback management.

3. **Similar APIs Comparison**:
   - **getAvailableRollbacks()**: Has a high similarity score (0.9960804581642151) and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code snippet is very similar, involving `awaitResult` on a lambda instance.
   - **notifyStagedSession(I)I**: Also has a high similarity score (0.9672808051109314) with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It involves a similar pattern of awaiting the result of a lambda instance.

Given these points:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating they are either system-internal or require significant permissions.
- The enforcement of `manageRollbacks` permission and the asynchronous operation to manage rollbacks suggest that `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` deals with sensitive operations or data that should be protected at a level similar to its peers.

Therefore, based on the comparison with similar APIs and the method's internal logic, it is reasonable to conclude that `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` should have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
