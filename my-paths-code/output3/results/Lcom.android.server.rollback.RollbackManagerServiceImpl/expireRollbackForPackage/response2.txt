To determine the access control level for the `expireRollbackForPackage` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `expireRollbackForPackage` method creates an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7` and passes it to the `awaitResult` method. This `awaitResult` method executes the lambda asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.runAsync`. Before doing so, it checks if the current thread is not a worker thread via the `assertNotInWorkerThread` method.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink codes indicate that the critical operations are related to creating and executing lambdas asynchronously (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7`) and running tasks asynchronously with `CompletableFuture.runAsync`. These operations do not directly imply a dangerous or normal access control level without considering their context within the application.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `reloadPersistedData()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions, possibly due to its internal implementation details and how it interacts with sensitive data or operations.
   - Another similar API, `notifyStagedSession(I)I`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves awaiting the result of a lambda execution, which shares similarities with the asynchronous operation in `expireRollbackForPackage`.

Given these observations:
- The methods that are considered similar (`reloadPersistedData` and `notifyStagedSession`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that operations involving internal state management or notifications might require elevated permissions to ensure system integrity or data consistency.
- The `expireRollbackForPackage` method's implementation does not directly expose sensitive user data or perform operations that would categorically be considered dangerous (e.g., accessing external storage, camera, location). However, its asynchronous nature and interaction with potentially sensitive rollback management could imply a need for protection against misuse.

Considering the above points and the fact that similar APIs have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that `expireRollbackForPackage` should also be protected at a similar level to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of its functionality, which might impact system stability or data integrity.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `expireRollbackForPackage` API would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
