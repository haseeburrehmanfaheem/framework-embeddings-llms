To determine the access control level for the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method posts a task to a handler using an anonymous lambda function (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda14`). This operation does not seem to involve any sensitive data or operations that would require high-level permissions. However, the fact that it interacts with a handler and potentially performs some asynchronous operation suggests that it might need some level of access control.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `expireRollbackForPackage(Ljava/lang/String;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also involves creating an anonymous lambda function (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7`) and awaiting a result, which shares some similarities with the operations in `snapshotAndRestoreUserData`.

2. `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It creates another type of lambda function (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8`) and awaits a result, showing a pattern similar to the first API.

Both of these APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. Given the similarities in how these methods operate (involving lambda functions and awaiting results), it's reasonable to infer that `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` might also require a similar level of access control.

However, without explicit information on what sensitive operations `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` performs or what data it accesses, we must rely on the patterns observed in similar APIs. Since both provided examples have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control and given the method's interaction with system-level components (like handlers), it seems plausible that `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` would also require a significant level of access control.

But considering the information given and the fact that the method does not explicitly deal with sensitive data or operations that are typically restricted to `SYS_OR_SIG`, and without explicit evidence of it requiring system or signature-level permissions, a more conservative approach might be warranted. 

Given this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for `snapshotAndRestoreUserData`, based on the information provided and the similarities with other APIs, would likely not be `NONE` due to its interaction with system components, nor necessarily `DANGEROUS` without clear evidence of risky operations, but rather something that reflects its need for potentially elevated permissions while being cautious about over-assigning access control.

Thus, considering the pattern and the need for a balanced approach without explicit sensitive operations or data handling mentioned, the final access control level could be considered as `SYS_OR_SIG` due to the similarities with other APIs and the involvement of system-level interactions, even though a definitive conclusion requires more specific details about the method's exact operations and the data it handles.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
