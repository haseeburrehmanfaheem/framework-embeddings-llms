To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableRollbacks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `getAvailableRollbacks` checks if it's not being called from a worker thread (`p0.assertNotInWorkerThread();`), enforces manage rollbacks permission (`p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getAvailableRollbacks");`), and then awaits the result of an asynchronous operation initiated by `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12`. This implies that it deals with rollback management, which is a system-level operation.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves creating an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12` and awaiting its result. This further suggests interaction with system-level rollback management services.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()**: Has a high similarity score (0.9960804581642151) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code pattern is very similar to `getAvailableRollbacks`, involving awaiting the result of a lambda operation related to rollback management.
   - **notifyStagedSession(I)I**: Although it has a slightly lower similarity score (0.9664520621299744), it's also assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` and involves a similar pattern of awaiting the result of an asynchronous operation, this time related to notifying a staged session.

Given these points:

- The method interacts with system-level rollback management.
- It enforces specific permissions (`manageRollbacks`).
- Similar methods with high similarity scores are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level access control due to their interaction with sensitive system operations.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the `getAvailableRollbacks` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` because it deals with system-level rollback management and requires specific permissions, aligning with the access control levels of similar APIs.
