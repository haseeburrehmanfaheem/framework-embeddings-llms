To assign an access control level to the `isDeviceSecure` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `isDeviceSecure` method interacts with sensitive information such as device lock status and user profiles. It calls methods like `isAppOrDisplayOnAnyVirtualDevice`, `resolveProfileParent`, and `isSeparateProfileChallengeEnabled`, which are related to device security and user management.

Comparing the code of `isDeviceSecure` with the similar APIs, we can see that it shares similarities with `setDeviceLockedForUser` and `isDeviceLocked`. These APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive information.

The sink code provided also shows that the `isDeviceSecure` method accesses sensitive information, such as the device lock status and user profiles, which requires a certain level of access control.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the `isDeviceSecure` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, similar to the provided similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
