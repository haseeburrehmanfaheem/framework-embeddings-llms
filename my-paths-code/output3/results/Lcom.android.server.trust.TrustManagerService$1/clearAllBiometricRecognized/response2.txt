To determine the access control level for the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method appears to clear biometric recognition data for all users. It interacts with a `SparseBooleanArray` named `mUsersUnlockedByBiometric`, which suggests it is involved in managing user unlock states based on biometric data.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided shows that the method clears the `mUsersUnlockedByBiometric` array, indicating a direct manipulation of sensitive user data related to biometric unlock statuses.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **unlockedByBiometricForUser**: This API has a high similarity score and is involved in setting the biometric unlock status for a specific user. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute, due to its interaction with sensitive user data.
   - **setDeviceLockedForUser**: Although its similarity score is somewhat lower, this API also interacts with sensitive device lock status for users and requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control. It sets the device locked state for a specific user.

4. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - The method `clearAllBiometricRecognized` directly manipulates sensitive biometric data by clearing all records, which could potentially be used to bypass security measures or erase evidence of previous unlocks.
   - Given its impact on system security and user privacy, assigning a lower access control level (like `NONE` or `NORMAL`) might not be appropriate.
   - The `enforceReportPermission` call within the method suggests some form of permission checking is in place, though its effectiveness depends on the actual implementation.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the method's functionality and its similarity to other APIs that require system or signature-level permissions due to their sensitive nature, it's reasonable to conclude that `clearAllBiometricRecognized` should also have a similar access control level to protect user data and maintain system security.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs that interact with sensitive user and device security settings, ensuring that modifications to biometric recognition data are properly secured.
