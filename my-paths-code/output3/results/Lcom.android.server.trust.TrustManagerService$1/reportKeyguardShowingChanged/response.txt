Based on the provided code, here's the analysis:

The API `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` has several method invocations and object creations. 

- The `enforceReportPermission()` method is invoked with no parameters from the API, but since it doesn't return a value or modify any fields used by other potential sink cases, it can be considered an auxiliary operation (input validation/sanity checks) according to the negative rules.

- Three instances of `-$$Nest$fgetmHandler(TrustManagerService p1)` are invoked. These methods have naming similarity with no API name, and they return a `Handler` object which is used in subsequent operations but do not directly contribute to any sink cases based on the provided positive rules since their returned value isn't directly used for creating new objects that would be returned by the API or modified fields used in other potential sink cases.

- A new `TrustManagerService$1$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` object is created, which has naming similarity with no API name. However, this object's creation doesn't seem to follow any of the positive rules directly since it isn't returned by the API and its usage (`runWithScissors`) does not propagate data flow from the API parameters or create a new object that would be used in other sink cases.

- The `sendEmptyMessage(6)` method invocation on the `Handler` object doesn't follow any of the positive rules as it's an auxiliary operation (obtaining an instance of a class, or accessing context objects), and its return value isn't propagated to create new objects that would be returned by the API.

Since none of these operations clearly follow the positive rules for identifying sinks without further context about how `TrustManagerService$1$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`'s `runWithScissors` method behaves or what data it manipulates, and considering the provided negative rules which suggest ignoring auxiliary operations like obtaining a handler instance or sending messages through it, we cannot accurately identify any sink cases from the given code snippets.

Thus, based on the provided information and adhering strictly to the specified positive and negative rules for identifying sinks, there are no identified sink sets in this API that fit the criteria. 

```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```

This JSON reflects the absence of any identified sink cases within the analyzed code according to the given rules.
