Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `unregisterTrustListener` method to determine its access control level.

The method has a similarity score of 0.9970855712890625 with the `registerTrustListener` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the two methods are closely related and may have similar security requirements.

Both methods interact with the same sink, which is the `Message` object obtained from the `Handler` instance. The `registerTrustListener` method sends a message with a code of 1, while the `unregisterTrustListener` method sends a message with a code of 2. However, the similarity in their code structure and the fact that they both use the same sink suggests that they may require similar access control levels.

Additionally, the `reportUnlockAttempt` API has a similarity score of 0.9902768731117249 with the `unregisterTrustListener` method and also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that the `unregisterTrustListener` method may require a similar access control level.

The `enforceListenerPermission` method is called at the beginning of the `unregisterTrustListener` method, but it does not seem to have any effect since it simply returns without performing any checks. However, this does not necessarily mean that the method does not require any access control.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `unregisterTrustListener` method, as it is similar to other methods that have been assigned this level and interacts with the same sink.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
