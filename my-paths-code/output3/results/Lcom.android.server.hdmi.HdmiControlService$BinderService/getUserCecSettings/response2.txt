To assign an access control level to the `getUserCecSettings` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs.

The `getUserCecSettings` method has a depth of 2, which means it calls other methods that may perform access control checks. At depth 0, it clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and then restores it after retrieving the user settings. This suggests that the method is trying to avoid imposing its own permissions on the caller.

At depth 1, the `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall` method calls `initBinderCall`, which at depth 2, enforces access permission using `p0.enforceAccessPermission()` and sets the work source UID to the calling UID. This implies that the `getUserCecSettings` method is indeed performing some level of access control.

The sink code snippets suggest that the method is retrieving user settings from the HDMI CEC config, which may contain sensitive information.

Comparing this with the similar API `getCecSettingIntValue`, we see that it has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also retrieves a setting value from the HDMI CEC config, but as an integer. The similarity score between the two APIs is relatively high (0.864), indicating that they share some commonalities.

Given these observations, it's likely that the `getUserCecSettings` method requires a similar level of access control to protect sensitive user settings. Therefore, we can assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
