Based on the provided code, here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "p0.enforceAccessPermission();",
        "p1.initBinderCall();"
    ],
    [
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);",
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$12 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$12(p0,p1,p2,p3);"
    ]
]
}
```

Here is the reasoning:

- The first sink array contains instructions that are related to access control and permission checks. `enforceAccessPermission()` has high sensitivity as it directly impacts the security of the system, making it a critical sink. It is linked with `initBinderCall()`, which initiates this check.
  
- The second sink array involves the creation and execution of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$12` object. This object is created using API parameters (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) and then executed on a service thread, indicating data propagation from the API input to the object's behavior.

The order prioritizes access control checks as more sensitive due to their direct impact on system security compared to object creation and execution.
