After carefully reviewing the provided information, I will assign an access control level to the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` API.

The API has three paths with a depth of 2, and all of them call the `initBinderCall` method, which contains the following sink code:

```java
p0.enforceAccessPermission();
p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();
```

This is similar to the sink code found in the two provided similar APIs: `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V` and `setCecSettingStringValue(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Additionally, the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` API is interacting with the same sinks as the similar APIs, which suggests that it should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity between the APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` API:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
