Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method.

The method has two paths with a depth of 2, and both paths involve calling `initBinderCall`, which includes `enforceAccessPermission` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid`. This suggests that the method is enforcing some kind of access control.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permission to call.
2. `setInputChangeListener`: This method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these similar APIs are related to setting up listeners for HDMI events, and they both require system or signature-level permission.

Given the similarity in functionality and the presence of access control enforcement in the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method, it is likely that this method also requires system or signature-level permission to call.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
