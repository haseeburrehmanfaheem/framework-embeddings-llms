To determine the access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `sendMhlVendorCommand` API has a depth of 2 and interacts with the following methods:

1. `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)` at depth 0, which calls `initBinderCall()` at depth 1.
2. `initBinderCall()` at depth 1, which calls `enforceAccessPermission()` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.
3. `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1)` at depth 0, which runs a service thread with the provided parameters.

The sink code for this API includes:

1. `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)` and `p1.initBinderCall()`, followed by `p0.enforceAccessPermission()`.
2. `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1)` and the creation of a new `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21` object.

Comparing this API with the similar APIs:

* The `setSystemAudioVolume(III)V` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and runs a service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1)`.
* The `toggleAndFollowTvPower()V` API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and calls `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)` followed by `initBinderCall()` and `enforceAccessPermission()`.

Based on the similarities between these APIs, it appears that the `sendMhlVendorCommand` API also requires a system or signature-level access control to interact with the HDMI control service. The presence of `enforceAccessPermission()` in the code snippet suggests that this API is not accessible to all applications and requires specific permissions.

Therefore, considering the similarities with other APIs and the semantics of the `sendMhlVendorCommand` API, I conclude that its access control level should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
