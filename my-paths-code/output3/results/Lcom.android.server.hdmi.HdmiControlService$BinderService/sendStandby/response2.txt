Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `sendStandby` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `sendStandby` method has a depth of 2, with the following code snippet:
```java
public void sendStandby(int p1, int p2){
    HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);
    HdmiControlService$BinderService$16 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$16(p0,p2,p1);
    this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);
    return;
}
```
The method calls `initBinderCall` which enforces access permission using `p0.enforceAccessPermission()` and sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.

The similar APIs, `deviceSelect` and `setStandbyMode`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and also call `initBinderCall` which enforces access permission and sets the work source UID.

Given this information, it appears that the `sendStandby` method requires a similar level of access control as the similar APIs. Since the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is likely that the `sendStandby` method also requires this level of access control.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
