After reviewing the provided information, we can see that the `removeHotplugEventListener` method has two paths with a depth of 2. Both paths involve calling `initBinderCall`, which in turn calls `enforceAccessPermission` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid`. This suggests that the method is enforcing some kind of access control.

The sink code provided also shows that the method is interacting with the `HdmiControlService` and is removing a hotplug event listener. The similar APIs provided, such as `setProhibitMode` and `setInputChangeListener`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require either system or signature-level permission to access.

Given this information, it seems likely that the `removeHotplugEventListener` method also requires some kind of access control. Since it is interacting with the `HdmiControlService` and removing a hotplug event listener, it is possible that it requires system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeHotplugEventListener` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
