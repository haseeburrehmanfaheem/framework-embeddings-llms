To determine the access control level for the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `addCecSettingChangeListener` method is used to add a listener for changes in CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) settings. This involves registering a callback with the system so that when specific events occur related to CEC settings, the registered listener can be notified.

2. **Analyzing the Code Paths**:
   - Both paths provided show that before adding the listener, there's an attempt to enforce access permission through `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$menforceAccessPermission`. However, the actual enforcement of permissions seems to be minimal or not effectively implemented in the given code snippets.
   - The core functionality involves checking if a record exists for the given setting, potentially creating a new list for callbacks if needed, and then registering the listener.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs provided (`removeCecSettingChangeListener`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to managing CEC setting change listeners are considered sensitive enough to require system or signature-level permissions.
   - These similar APIs also interact with the `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords` and `mHdmiCecConfig`, indicating that they operate within a similar domain of functionality and security concerns as the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the sensitive nature of CEC settings and the fact that managing listeners for these settings could potentially allow an app to monitor or influence system behavior in ways that might not be desirable without proper permissions, it's reasonable to infer that `addCecSettingChangeListener` should have a similar level of access control as its counterparts.
   - The lack of robust permission enforcement within the provided code paths does not necessarily dictate the access control level; instead, it suggests an oversight or simplification in the example code.

Considering these points, and especially looking at the similar APIs which deal with removing listeners and are categorized under `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is logical to conclude that `addCecSettingChangeListener` should also be under a similar access control level due to its potential impact on system functionality and security.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the method's purpose, the code paths provided, and the comparison with similar APIs, the access control level for `addCecSettingChangeListener` should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination is made to ensure that only authorized components or applications can add listeners for CEC setting changes, thus maintaining system security and integrity.
