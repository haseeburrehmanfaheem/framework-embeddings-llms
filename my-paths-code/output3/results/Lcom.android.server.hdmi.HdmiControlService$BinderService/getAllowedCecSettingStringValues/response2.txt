To determine the access control level for the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Method Code and Paths**: The method involves interacting with `HdmiCecConfig`, specifically retrieving allowed string values for a given setting. It also includes binder calls and permission enforcement.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code highlights interactions with `HdmiCecConfig` settings, including getting the setting by name, checking its value type, and retrieving allowed values.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getCecSettingIntValue`: This method retrieves an integer value for a specific CEC setting. It has a similarity score of 0.865 with the target method and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `setCecSettingStringValue`: This method sets a string value for a CEC setting. It has a similarity score of 0.833 with the target method, also assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these points:

- The method involves accessing and manipulating HDMI CEC settings, which could potentially impact system functionality or security.
- Both similar APIs (`getCecSettingIntValue` and `setCecSettingStringValue`) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. This suggests that operations related to CEC settings are considered sensitive.
- The `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method, while not directly modifying settings (it only retrieves allowed values), is still part of the ecosystem that deals with CEC configurations. Its ability to reveal what string values are permissible for a setting could be seen as needing protection to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

Considering these factors and the similarity in functionality with other APIs assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures consistency in securing operations related to CEC settings, whether they involve retrieving information or making changes.

**Access Control Level Decision:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision reflects the method's involvement with potentially sensitive system configurations and aligns with the access control levels assigned to similar methods that interact with CEC settings.
