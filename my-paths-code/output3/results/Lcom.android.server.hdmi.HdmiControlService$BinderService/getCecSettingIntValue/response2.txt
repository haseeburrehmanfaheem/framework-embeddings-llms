To determine the access control level for the `getCecSettingIntValue` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getCecSettingIntValue` method retrieves an integer value from the HDMI CEC configuration. It first calls `initBinderCall`, which enforces access permission and sets the work source UID to the calling UID. Then, it gets the HDMI CEC configuration, retrieves the setting for the given parameter `p1`, checks if its value type is "int", and finally returns the integer value.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `setCecSettingStringValue`: This method sets a string value in the HDMI CEC configuration. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues`: This method retrieves a list of allowed string values for a given setting in the HDMI CEC configuration. It also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access the HDMI CEC configuration.

The `getCecSettingIntValue` method also interacts with the HDMI CEC configuration, but it only retrieves a value and does not modify it. However, it still requires access permission enforcement through the `initBinderCall` method.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the `getCecSettingIntValue` method should have an access control level similar to the provided similar APIs.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
