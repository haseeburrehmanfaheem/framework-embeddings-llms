To determine the access control level for the `getActiveSource` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getActiveSource` method involves several internal calls that interact with HDMI devices and their configurations.
   - It checks for active sources, gets device info based on paths or physical addresses, and constructs `HdmiDeviceInfo` objects.
   - The presence of `enforceAccessPermission()` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` in the call stack indicates that access control and permissions are being enforced.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets involve getting safe device info by path, getting active paths from TV devices, and constructing hardware port information for HDMI devices.
   - These operations suggest interactions with system-level resources or configurations related to HDMI and audio settings.

3. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The similar API `canChangeSystemAudioMode()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - This method checks if there's a system audio device available and gets safe AVR (Audio/Video Receiver) device info, which implies it deals with system-level audio configurations.
   - Given its similarity score of 0.8405741453170776, it suggests that the operations and concerns (e.g., system audio modes, device permissions) are closely related to those in `getActiveSource`.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Considering the internal calls, sink code, and similar API analysis, the `getActiveSource` method seems to be involved with system-level configurations or resources, specifically those related to HDMI devices and their states.
   - The enforcement of access permissions and the similarity with a `SYS_OR_SIG` level API suggest that this method requires a significant level of access control.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for the `getActiveSource` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the system-level interactions and permission enforcements observed in its code paths and similar APIs.
