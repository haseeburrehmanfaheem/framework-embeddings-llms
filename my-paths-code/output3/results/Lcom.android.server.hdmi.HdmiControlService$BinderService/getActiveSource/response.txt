Based on the provided code paths, I have analyzed the API `getActiveSource` and identified potential sinks. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "HdmiDeviceInfo v9 = this.mHdmiCecNetwork.getSafeDeviceInfoByPath(v8);",
            "int v8 = v7.getActivePath();",
            "HdmiCecLocalDeviceTv v7 = p0.tv();",
            "HdmiCecLocalDeviceTv v6 = p0.tv();",
            "return phiInstruction;"
        ],
        [
            "HdmiDeviceInfo v8 = HdmiDeviceInfo.hardwarePort(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress, v7);",
            "int v7 = p0.pathToPortId(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress);",
            "HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource v4 = p0.getLocalActiveSource();",
            "return v8;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

The first sink is related to the `getSafeDeviceInfoByPath` method, which returns a `HdmiDeviceInfo` object based on the active path. This object is then returned by the API.

The second sink is related to the `hardwarePort` method, which creates a new `HdmiDeviceInfo` object using the physical address and port ID of the active source. This object is also returned by the API.

Both sinks follow at least one positive rule: they have naming similarity with the API name (`getActiveSource`) and return values that are used directly by the API. The instructions in each sink array are listed in the order they appear in the code, showing a clear dataflow link between them. 

Note that some methods like `playback`, `tv`, `isValid` are not considered as sinks because they do not have direct influence on the output of the API and their results are used for internal operations or checks. Similarly, `initBinderCall` is not a sink as it performs auxiliary operations (enforcing access permission and setting work source UID to calling UID).
