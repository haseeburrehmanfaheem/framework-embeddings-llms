Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `sendKeyEvent` method as follows:

1. The method has a depth of 2, with the first level calling `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall`, which in turn calls `initBinderCall`.
2. The `initBinderCall` method contains two sink code lines: `p0.enforceAccessPermission()` and `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`. These lines are responsible for enforcing access permissions and setting the work source UID to the calling UID, respectively.
3. The similar APIs provided, `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V` and `setCecSettingStringValue(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V`, have a similarity score of 1.0 with the `sendKeyEvent` method. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
4. The code snippets for the similar APIs also contain the same sink code lines: `p0.enforceAccessPermission()` and `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.

Given this analysis, it appears that the `sendKeyEvent` method is enforcing access permissions and setting the work source UID to the calling UID, which is consistent with the behavior of the similar APIs. Therefore, based on the similarity in code and behavior, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to the `sendKeyEvent` method.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
