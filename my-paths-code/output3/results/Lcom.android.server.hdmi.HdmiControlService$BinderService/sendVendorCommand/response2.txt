Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `sendVendorCommand` method as follows:

1. The method has a depth of 2, indicating that it calls other methods internally.
2. At depth 0, the method creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15` and passes it to `runOnServiceThread`, which suggests that it interacts with a service thread.
3. At depth 1, the `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall` method is called, which in turn calls `initBinderCall` at depth 2.
4. The `initBinderCall` method calls `enforceAccessPermission` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid`, which are similar to the code snippets found in the similar APIs (`powerOnRemoteDevice` and `setCecSettingStringValue`).
5. The sink code indicates that the method interacts with the `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15` instance and calls `enforceAccessPermission` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid`, which are similar to the patterns found in the similar APIs.

Considering the similarities between the `sendVendorCommand` method and the provided similar APIs (`powerOnRemoteDevice` and `setCecSettingStringValue`), it is likely that the `sendVendorCommand` method requires a similar access control level.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that the `sendVendorCommand` method should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the final access control level for the `sendVendorCommand` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
