Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `setHdmiRecordListener` API.

The sink code for this API includes two parts:

1. `p0.enforceAccessPermission(); p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`
2. `HdmiControlService$HdmiRecordListenerRecord v0 = new HdmiControlService$HdmiRecordListenerRecord(p0,p1); this.mRecordListenerRecord = v0;`

The first part of the sink code is related to access permission and work source UID, which suggests that the API requires some level of access control.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and includes the same code `p0.enforceAccessPermission(); p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`.
* `setCecSettingStringValue(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and includes the same code `p0.enforceAccessPermission(); p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`.

Given the similarity in code and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `setHdmiRecordListener` API also requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `setHdmiRecordListener` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
