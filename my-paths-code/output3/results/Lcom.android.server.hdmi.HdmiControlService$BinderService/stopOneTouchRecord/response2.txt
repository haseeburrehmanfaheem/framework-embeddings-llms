Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `stopOneTouchRecord` method as follows:

1. The method has a depth of 2, with the first call being to `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)`, which then calls `initBinderCall()`.
2. In the `initBinderCall()` method, it enforces access permission using `p0.enforceAccessPermission()` and sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.
3. The sink code shows that the `initBinderCall()` method is called, which includes the enforcement of access permission and setting of the work source UID.
4. The similar APIs provided have a similarity score of 1.0 with the `stopOneTouchRecord` method, indicating that they are very similar in terms of their functionality and code structure.
5. Both similar APIs (`sendStandby(II)V` and `deviceSelect(ILandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the `stopOneTouchRecord` method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access, as it enforces access permission and sets the work source UID in a similar manner to the provided similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `stopOneTouchRecord` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
