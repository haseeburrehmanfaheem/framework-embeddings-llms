To determine the access control level for the `queryDisplayStatus` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `queryDisplayStatus` method initializes a binder call through `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);`, which eventually leads to calling `initBinderCall()` on the service.
   - Within `initBinderCall()`, two key operations are performed: `p0.enforceAccessPermission();` and `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`. The first line enforces access permissions, indicating that this method is checking for specific rights or privileges before proceeding. The second line sets the work source UID to the calling UID, which can be related to tracking or managing the caller's identity or permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code `p0.enforceAccessPermission();` followed by `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();` is crucial as it directly relates to permission checking and user identity management. This suggests that the method is indeed concerned with access control and potentially sensitive operations.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`powerOnRemoteDevice` and `setCecSettingStringValue`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 
   - They also perform the same permission enforcement and UID setting operations as observed in the sink code of `queryDisplayStatus`.
   - The high similarity score (1.0) indicates that these APIs are very similar in functionality or implementation details to `queryDisplayStatus`, suggesting they likely require similar access control levels due to their comparable operational contexts.

Given this analysis, since both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and the code snippet for `queryDisplayStatus` involves permission enforcement and setting the work source UID (operations also present in the similar APIs), it's reasonable to conclude that `queryDisplayStatus` should have a similar access control requirement.

**Conclusion**: The access control level for the `queryDisplayStatus` method, based on its operational similarity to `powerOnRemoteDevice` and `setCecSettingStringValue`, as well as its enforcement of access permissions and management of calling UID, should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
