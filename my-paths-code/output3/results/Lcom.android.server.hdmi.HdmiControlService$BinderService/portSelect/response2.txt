To determine the access control level for the `portSelect` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs.

The `portSelect` method has two sinks:

1. `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$2(p0,p2,p1); this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);`
2. `p0.enforceAccessPermission();`

The first sink is similar to the one found in the `deviceSelect` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The second sink is identical to the one found in the `getDeviceList` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the high similarity scores between `portSelect` and these two APIs (0.9999999403953552 and 0.9972963333129883, respectively), it is likely that `portSelect` requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the code analysis and comparison with similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `portSelect` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
