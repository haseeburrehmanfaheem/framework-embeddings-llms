To determine the access control level for the `setArcMode` API, we'll analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `setArcMode` method has a depth of 2 in its call stack. Here's what happens at each depth level:

1. **Depth 0**: The `setArcMode` method initializes a binder call using `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)`, and then creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14` with `p0` as a parameter. This instance is run on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1)`.

2. **Depth 1**: The `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall` method simply calls `initBinderCall()` on the `HdmiControlService` instance (`p1`).

3. **Depth 2**: In the `initBinderCall()` method, two critical operations are performed:
   - `enforceAccessPermission()`: This suggests that some form of permission checking is enforced.
   - `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`: This sets the work source UID to the calling UID, which could be related to how the system tracks or manages resource usage or access.

The sink code involves creating an instance of a binder service and running it on the service thread, similar to what's seen in the provided similar APIs. 

Given these details, let's examine the similar APIs:

- **askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource**: This has a high similarity score (0.9856756925582886) with `setArcMode` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves running a binder service on the service thread, which is comparable to what `setArcMode` does.

- **setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource**: This API also has a high similarity score (0.9837446212768555) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its operation involves running a different binder service on the service thread, but the mechanism is analogous to `setArcMode`.

Given these similarities in both code structure and the enforcement of access permissions at depth 2, it's reasonable to conclude that `setArcMode` should have a similar access control level. The fact that both comparison APIs are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions, suggests that `setArcMode` likely requires a comparable level of access control due to its interaction with system services and enforcement of access permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code snippet, similar APIs, and their respective access control levels, the final access control level for the `setArcMode` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
