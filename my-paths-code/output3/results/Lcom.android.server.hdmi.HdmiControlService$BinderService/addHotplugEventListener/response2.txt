Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `addHotplugEventListener` method.

The method has three paths with a depth of 2, and all of them call `initBinderCall()` which contains the following sink code:

```java
p0.enforceAccessPermission();
p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();
```

This sink code is similar to the code in the provided similar APIs (`powerOnRemoteDevice` and `setCecSettingStringValue`) which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Additionally, the `addHotplugEventListener` method also interacts with other sinks such as creating a new `HdmiControlService$HotplugEventListenerRecord` and adding it to `mHotplugEventListenerRecords`. However, these interactions do not seem to require a higher access control level than `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering the similarity in code and the interactions with sinks, we can conclude that the access control level for the `addHotplugEventListener` method is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
