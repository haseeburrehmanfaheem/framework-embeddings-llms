Based on the provided code, here is the analysis of potential sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$11 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$11(p0,p1);",
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);"
    ],
    [
        "p0.enforceAccessPermission();",
        "p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();"
    ]
]
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* The first sink set includes the creation of a new `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11` object with `p1` as an argument, and then passing this object to `runOnServiceThread`. This creates a data flow link between the API input parameter `p1` and the created object. According to the positive rules, creating a new object with dataflow from the API parameters is considered a potential sink.
* The second sink set includes two method invocations: `enforceAccessPermission()` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`. Although these methods do not have direct naming similarity with the API name or take the input parameter as an argument, they are both related to access control and permission management. However, since `enforceAccessPermission()` is a generic utility method for input validation/sanity checks, it should be considered less sensitive compared to other potential sinks.

Note that `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);` is an auxiliary operation (obtaining an instance of a class), and thus not considered a sink. 

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive, I placed the creation of the new object with data flow from the API parameters at the top, followed by the access control and permission management methods.
