To determine the access control level for the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method has three paths with a depth of 2. Each path involves checking permissions through `enforceAccessPermission()` before proceeding to remove a listener from `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords`. This suggests that access control is enforced, but the specifics of what `enforceAccessPermission()` does are not detailed in the provided code snippets.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink codes involve operations like checking if a key exists in `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords`, unregistering a listener, and removing change listeners from `mHdmiCecConfig`. These operations imply modification of system settings or configurations related to HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control), which typically require specific permissions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `addCecSettingChangeListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires either system or signature-level permission.
   - The code for these similar APIs involves registering listeners and modifying the `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords` and `mHdmiCecConfig`. This suggests that adding or removing CEC setting change listeners is a sensitive operation that should be restricted to authorized components.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that:

- The method is related to system settings/configuration changes (specifically, HDMI CEC settings), which typically require specific permissions.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that these operations are sensitive and should be restricted.
- The presence of permission enforcement (`enforceAccessPermission()`) in all paths indicates an intent to restrict access, although the exact nature of this enforcement is not specified.

Therefore, considering the need for protection of system settings and the precedent set by similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `removeCecSettingChangeListener` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, reflecting the requirement for either system or signature-level permission to perform such operations.
