Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method as follows:

1. The method has a depth of 2, indicating that it calls other methods internally.
2. At depth 0, the method creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1)`.
3. At depth 1, the `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall` method is called, which in turn calls `initBinderCall()` at depth 2.
4. The `initBinderCall()` method enforces access permission using `p0.enforceAccessPermission()` and sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.
5. The sink code includes the creation of the `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` instance and the call to `runOnServiceThread`, as well as the enforcement of access permission and setting of the work source UID.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `setCecSettingStringValue(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V` has a similarity score of 1.0 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code includes the enforcement of access permission and setting of the work source UID, similar to the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method.
* `sendVendorCommand(II[BZ)V` also has a similarity score of 1.0 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, with similar code patterns.

Given these similarities, it is reasonable to conclude that the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method should have the same access control level as the similar APIs, which is SYS_OR_SIG.

The final answer is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
