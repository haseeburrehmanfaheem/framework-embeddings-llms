To determine the access control level for the `getDeviceList` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getDeviceList` method calls `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)`, which in turn calls `initBinderCall()`.
   - Within `initBinderCall()`, it executes `p0.enforceAccessPermission()` and `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`. The key part here is `enforceAccessPermission()`, which suggests that the method enforces access permissions, implying a need for some level of access control.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code includes `List v3 = v2.getSafeCecDevicesLocked(); return v3;` and `p0.enforceAccessPermission();`. The presence of `enforceAccessPermission()` as a sink indicates that the method is accessing or manipulating data that requires permission checks.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `portSelect(ILandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and calls `p0.enforceAccessPermission();`. This suggests that methods within this context that enforce access permissions are typically considered to require significant access control, aligning with the `SYS_OR_SIG` level.
   - The API `registerStrongAuthTracker(Landroid/app/trust/IStrongAuthTracker;)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` but checks password read permission using `p0.checkPasswordReadPermission();`. Although it uses a different permission check, the context implies that strong authentication or authorization is required.

Given these points:
- The presence of `enforceAccessPermission()` in both the method's code and its similar APIs indicates a need for access control.
- The similarity scores suggest that these methods are closely related in terms of functionality and security requirements.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions, which is typically reserved for operations that can significantly impact the device's security or functionality.

Therefore, considering the method enforces access permissions and its similarity to other methods with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is reasonable to assign the same level of access control to `getDeviceList`.
