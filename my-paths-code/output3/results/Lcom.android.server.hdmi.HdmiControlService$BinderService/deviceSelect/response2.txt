Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `deviceSelect` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `deviceSelect` method has a depth of 2 and interacts with the `HdmiControlService` class, which is also present in the similar APIs. The sink code for `deviceSelect` includes calls to `initBinderCall`, `enforceAccessPermission`, and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid`, which are also found in the similar APIs.

The similar APIs, `sendStandby` and `setStandbyMode`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs have a similarity score of 1.0 with the `deviceSelect` method, indicating that they are highly similar in terms of their code structure and functionality.

Given the similarities between the `deviceSelect` method and the provided similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `deviceSelect` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
