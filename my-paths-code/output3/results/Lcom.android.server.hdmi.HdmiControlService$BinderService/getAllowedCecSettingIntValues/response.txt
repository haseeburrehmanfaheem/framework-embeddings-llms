To analyze the provided Java code for potential sinks that require access control, we'll break down each step of execution to understand data flows through the API. We will identify method invocations, field accesses and updates, object creations, and data flows, paying special attention to instructions that collectively contribute to a sink.

Given the positive rules:
1. Method invoked in the API (both native and other inner methods), which either have naming similarity with the API name, take the input parameters as arguments, or return a value used by the API.
2. Field get cases with naming similarity to the API name and are returned by the API or used with other sink cases.
3. Field set cases with naming similarity to the API name or modified with the API parameters.
4. Creation of new objects with naming similarity to the API or created with data flow from the API parameters, and are returned by the API or used with other sink cases.

And negative rules:
1. Generic utility methods (e.g., valueOf, toString, isEmpty).
2. Logging methods, input validation/sanity checks.
3. Auxiliary operations (e.g., locks, obtaining an instance of a class, or accessing context objects).

Analyzing the provided code paths for `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues(String p1)`:

### Path 1 Analysis

- The method `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` starts by invoking `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall`, which then calls `initBinderCall`. This sequence involves access control (`enforceAccessPermission`) and setting the work source UID to the calling UID, indicating potential security relevance.
- It retrieves an `HdmiCecConfig` object and uses it to get a list of allowed integer values for a given setting (`getAllowedIntValues(p1)`).
- The method creates a new stream from this list, maps its elements to integers using a lambda expression, and converts the result back into an array.
- The array is then returned.

### Path 2 Analysis

The analysis for Path 2 is identical to Path 1 since the provided code paths are the same.

### Path 3 Analysis

Similar to Paths 1 and 2, with minor variations in internal method calls but ultimately leading to the same sequence of operations relevant to potential sinks.

**Potential Sinks Identification**

Based on the positive rules:
- The invocation of `getAllowedIntValues(p1)` directly processes the input parameter `p1` and its return value is crucial for creating the output array, making it a sink.
- The creation of a new `HdmiControlService$BinderService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` object and its use to map integers could be considered due to its role in processing data that will be returned by the API.
- The `initBinderCall` method invocation, which includes access control checks (`enforceAccessPermission`) and setting the work source UID, is security-relevant.

Considering these points, we can identify a set of instructions contributing to potential sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);",
      "long v2 = Binder.clearCallingIdentity();",
      "HdmiCecConfig v3 = this.this$0.getHdmiCecConfig();",
      "List v4 = v3.getAllowedIntValues(p1);",
      "Stream v5 = v4.stream();",
      "HdmiControlService$BinderService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0 v6 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0();",
      "IntStream v7 = v6.mapToInt(v6);",
      "[I v8 = v7.toArray();",
      "return v8;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This JSON represents the primary sequence of operations that could be considered sinks based on their involvement with input parameters, access control, and object creation leading to the return value. Other methods like `initBinderCall`, `getSetting`, `getValueType`, and `getAllowedValues` play roles in the data flow but are represented within the context of the primary sink sequence.
