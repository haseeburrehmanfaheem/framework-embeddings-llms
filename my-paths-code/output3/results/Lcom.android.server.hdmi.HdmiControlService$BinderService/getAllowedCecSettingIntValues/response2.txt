To determine the access control level for the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that interact with the same sinks.

The provided code snippet shows that the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method:

1. Calls `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)`, which in turn calls `initBinderCall()`.
2. Clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`.
3. Retrieves an `HdmiCecConfig` object and uses it to get a list of allowed integer values for a given setting.
4. Processes the list and returns an array of integers.

The similar API, `setCecSettingIntValue(Ljava/lang/String;I)V`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also interacts with the `HdmiControlService` and `HdmiCecConfig` classes, but it sets an integer value for a given setting instead of retrieving allowed values.

Given the similarity between these two methods, we can infer that the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method is likely to require a similar access control level. Since it only retrieves information and does not modify any settings, its access control level might be less restrictive than `SYS_OR_SIG`.

However, considering that the method still interacts with the `HdmiControlService` and `HdmiCecConfig` classes, which are related to system-level functionality, it is likely that some level of access control is necessary.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method, as it is similar to the `setCecSettingIntValue` method and interacts with system-level functionality.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

Note that this decision is based on the provided information and may need to be revised if additional context or details about the API are available.
