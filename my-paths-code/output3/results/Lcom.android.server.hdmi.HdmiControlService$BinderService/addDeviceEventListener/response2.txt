Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `addDeviceEventListener` method.

The method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them call `initBinderCall()` which contains the sink code `p0.enforceAccessPermission();` and `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`. This suggests that the method is enforcing access permission and setting the work source UID to the calling UID.

The similar APIs provided, `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V` and `setCecSettingStringValue(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and contain the same sink code. This suggests that the `addDeviceEventListener` method is likely to have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `addDeviceEventListener` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
