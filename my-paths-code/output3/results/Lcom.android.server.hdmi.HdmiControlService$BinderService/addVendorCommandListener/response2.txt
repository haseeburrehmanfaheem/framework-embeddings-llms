Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addVendorCommandListener` method as follows:

* The method has a depth of 2, with the sink code at the deepest level calling `enforceAccessPermission()` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.
* The similar APIs, `powerOnRemoteDevice` and `setCecSettingStringValue`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and also call `enforceAccessPermission()` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.

Given the similarities in code and sink calls between `addVendorCommandListener` and the other two APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `addVendorCommandListener` should have the same access control level as the similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `addVendorCommandListener` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
