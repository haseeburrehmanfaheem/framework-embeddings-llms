To assign an access control level to the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs.

The `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method has two paths with a depth of 2. In both paths, it calls `initBinderCall()` which enforces access permission using `p0.enforceAccessPermission()`. This suggests that the method is checking for permissions before removing a system audio mode change listener.

Comparing this method with the similar API `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, we can see that both methods are related to managing system audio mode change listeners. The `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires either system or signature-level permission.

Given the similarities between these two methods, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`. Since removing a listener is a related operation to adding one, and both require some level of access control, we can infer that `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the assigned access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment makes sense because both adding and removing system audio mode change listeners are operations that should be restricted to authorized parties, such as system-level components or applications with the appropriate signature-level permissions.
