After analyzing the provided information, we can see that the `setCecSettingIntValue` method has two similar APIs: `powerOnRemoteDevice` and `setCecSettingStringValue`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The `setCecSettingIntValue` method also contains the sink code `p0.enforceAccessPermission(); p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, which is similar to the code in the two similar APIs. This suggests that the `setCecSettingIntValue` method requires a similar level of access control.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the `setCecSettingIntValue` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
