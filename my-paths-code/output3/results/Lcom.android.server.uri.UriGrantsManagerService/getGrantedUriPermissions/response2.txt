To determine the access control level for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `getGrantedUriPermissions` takes two parameters: a `String` and an `int`.
   - It initializes an empty `ArrayList`, creates a `ParceledListSlice` from this list, and returns it.
   - This operation does not seem to directly interact with sensitive data or operations that could pose a significant risk if accessed improperly.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code is focused on creating an empty list (`ArrayList`) and then wrapping it in a `ParceledListSlice` before returning it.
   - There's no apparent interaction with external resources, user data, or system-critical components that would inherently require elevated permissions.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API `getUriPermissions(Ljava/lang/String;ZZ)Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` has a high similarity score (0.9706020951271057), indicating its code logic and structure are very close to the method in question.
   - This similar API is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting it requires either system or signature-level permission to access, possibly due to its interaction with URI permissions which can be sensitive.

Given these points:

- The `getGrantedUriPermissions` method itself does not directly manipulate sensitive data or perform dangerous operations based on the provided code snippets.
- However, its similarity to an API that deals with URI permissions and is assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests it might be operating within a context where system or signature-level access control is relevant.

Considering the context of Android's permission model and the information provided:

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
This decision leans on the similarity with other APIs that deal with permissions and the potential sensitivity of the data it might handle, even though the specific code snippet does not directly indicate dangerous operations.
