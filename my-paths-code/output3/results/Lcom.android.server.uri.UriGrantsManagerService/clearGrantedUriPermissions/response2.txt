Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `clearGrantedUriPermissions` method to determine its access control level.

The method has two paths with a depth of 2, both of which lead to the same sink code. The sink code involves removing URI permissions for a package and scheduling a persist URI grants task.

The similar API `removeImeSurface()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that it requires either system or signature-level permission to access.

Comparing the two methods, we can see that `clearGrantedUriPermissions` also interacts with sensitive data (URI permissions) and performs a potentially privileged operation (removing permissions). The fact that it schedules a persist URI grants task using a handler also implies that it may require some level of system or signature-level access to ensure proper synchronization and security.

Given these similarities and the potential security implications, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `clearGrantedUriPermissions` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
