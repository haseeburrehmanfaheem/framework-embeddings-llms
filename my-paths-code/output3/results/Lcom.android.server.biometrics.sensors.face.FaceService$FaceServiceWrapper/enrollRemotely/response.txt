Since the provided code is a simple method with no internal complexity and immediately returns a constant value (-1), there are no instructions within this method that collectively contribute to a sink according to the given positive rules. The method does not invoke other methods, access or update fields in a manner that would indicate a potential sink, nor does it create new objects based on its parameters.

Therefore, for the provided code snippet:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

This JSON reflects that there are no identified sinks within the given API method `enrollRemotely`. The lack of any data flow or method invocations related to the input parameters means that none of the positive rules for identifying sinks are met.
