To assign an access control level to the `enroll` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `enroll` method has three paths:

1. The first path calls `FaceService.-$$Nest$mgetSingleProvider` and then schedules an enrollment using `Pair.second.scheduleEnroll`. This suggests that the method interacts with a face recognition service provider.
2. The second path also calls `FaceService.-$$Nest$mgetSingleProvider`, but returns -1 if the provider is null.
3. The third path is similar to the first one, but returns 0 if no provider is found.

The sink code snippets show that the method uses a pair object to store the sensor ID and provider, which is then used for enrollment.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `getFeature` has an access control level of NORMAL and interacts with face recognition service providers using similar code.
* `setFeature` also has an access control level of NORMAL and shares similarities in its code with `enroll`.

Given that both similar APIs have a NORMAL access control level, it is reasonable to assign the same level to the `enroll` method. The method does not seem to pose any significant security risks or require elevated privileges.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of NORMAL to the `enroll` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
