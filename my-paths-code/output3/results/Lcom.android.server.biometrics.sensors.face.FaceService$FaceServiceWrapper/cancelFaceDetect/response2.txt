To determine the access control level for the `cancelFaceDetect` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show that `cancelFaceDetect` interacts with the `FaceService` and uses a pair of values obtained from `getSingleProvider()` to call `cancelFaceDetect` on the second element of the pair. This is similar to the behavior of the two provided similar APIs, `cancelEnrollment` and `cancelAuthentication`, which also use `getSingleProvider()` and then call a method on the second element of the pair.

The key aspects to consider for access control are:

1. **Internal Permission Check**: The `isKeyguard` method checks if the context has an internal permission using `Utils.hasInternalPermission(p1)`. This suggests some level of access control.
2. **Similarity with Other APIs**: Both similar APIs (`cancelEnrollment` and `cancelAuthentication`) have a NORMAL access control level. Their code structure is also very similar to that of `cancelFaceDetect`, involving the use of `getSingleProvider()` and subsequent method calls on the provider.

Given these points:

- The `cancelFaceDetect` method involves interaction with potentially sensitive face detection functionality but does so in a manner consistent with other methods that are classified as NORMAL.
- There is an internal permission check, which suggests some level of access control, but this alone might not necessitate a higher access control level than NORMAL given the context of similar APIs.

Therefore, considering the similarities in code structure and functionality with `cancelEnrollment` and `cancelAuthentication`, both of which are classified as NORMAL, it is reasonable to conclude that `cancelFaceDetect` should also be classified as having a NORMAL access control level.
