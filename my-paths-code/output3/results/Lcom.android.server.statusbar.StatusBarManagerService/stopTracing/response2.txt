To determine the access control level for the `stopTracing` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `stopTracing` method sets `mTracingEnabled` to 0 and calls `stopTracing` on `this.mBar`. This suggests that it is controlling or managing some form of tracing or logging functionality.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `startTracing()V`, with high similarity scores (0.9443179368972778 and 0.8705247640609741). Both of these methods have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - The code for these similar APIs involves starting tracing on `this.mBar` and, in one case, setting `mTracingEnabled` to 1.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that the similar APIs (`startTracing()V`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that controlling tracing functionality (starting or stopping) does not require specific permissions or pose significant risks.
   - The operation performed by `stopTracing` is symmetrical to that of `startTracing`. Since `startTracing` has been assigned `NONE` as its access control level, and considering the nature of the operations (enabling/disabling tracing), it's logical to assign a similar access control level to `stopTracing`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the similarity in functionality with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of the `stopTracing` method, which does not seem to pose any significant security risks or require special permissions, it is reasonable to conclude that its access control level should also be `NONE`.

The final answer is: 
```
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
