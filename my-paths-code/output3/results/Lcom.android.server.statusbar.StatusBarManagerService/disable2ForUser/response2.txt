Based on the provided information, we can see that the `disable2ForUser` method is very similar to the `disable2(ILandroid/os/IBinder;Ljava/lang/String;)V` API, with a similarity score of 0.9764715433120728. This suggests that they share many similarities in terms of their code and functionality.

The `disable2(ILandroid/os/IBinder;Ljava/lang/String;)V` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities between the two APIs, it is likely that the `disable2ForUser` method also requires system or signature-level permission to access. Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity with the other API, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `disable2ForUser` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
