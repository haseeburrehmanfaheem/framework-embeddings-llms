To determine the access control level for the `onClearAllNotifications` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `onClearAllNotifications` calls `enforceStatusBarService()`, which suggests that it is checking if the caller is a status bar service or has equivalent permissions.
   - It uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` to get the UID and PID of the calling process, indicating it's considering the identity of the caller for security purposes.
   - The method then calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onClearAll(v2, v3, p1);`, passing the caller's UID, PID, and an additional parameter `p1`. This delegates the actual clearing of notifications to another component.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves getting the calling UID and PID and then clearing the calling identity temporarily before restoring it. This pattern is commonly used in Android to perform actions on behalf of another process securely.
   - The call to `this.mNotificationDelegate.onClearAll(v2, v3, p1);` suggests that the actual logic for clearing notifications resides elsewhere, but the decision to clear and the parameters are determined here.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`onNotificationClear` and `onNotificationError`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that these methods are expected to be called by system or signature applications, reflecting their sensitive nature in handling notifications.
   - The similarity in code patterns between these APIs and `onClearAllNotifications`, especially in terms of checking the caller's identity and delegating actions to another component (`this.mNotificationDelegate`), suggests a similar security requirement.

Given this analysis, `onClearAllNotifications` appears to follow a pattern where it needs to ensure that only authorized (system or signature) applications can clear all notifications. This action is sensitive because clearing all notifications could potentially be used maliciously to hide important information from the user.

Therefore, based on the similarities with other APIs and the method's functionality, the access control level for `onClearAllNotifications` should be **SYS_OR_SIG**, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission to execute.
