To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method, we should consider the similarity scores with other APIs and their corresponding access control levels. The provided similar APIs, `onNotificationClick` and `onNotificationDirectReplied`, both have a SYS_OR_SIG access control level.

1. **Similarity in Functionality**: Both similar APIs interact with `this.mNotificationDelegate` for different notification-related events (click and direct reply), suggesting that they are part of a system-level or signature-protected interface due to their access control levels being SYS_OR_SIG. The method `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` also interacts with `this.mNotificationDelegate`, indicating a similar level of system integration.

2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both provided similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This suggests that operations related to notification handling are restricted either to the system or to applications signed with the same certificate as the system, likely due to security and privacy considerations.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code for `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` involves calling `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);`, which is similar in nature to the operations performed by the other two APIs (invoking methods on `this.mNotificationDelegate`). This implies that it's dealing with internal system-level notification handling mechanisms.

4. **Security and Privacy Considerations**: Given the context of notification feedback, this operation might involve accessing or modifying sensitive information related to user interactions with notifications. Therefore, restricting access to system-level components or applications with the appropriate signature is reasonable from a security perspective.

Considering these points, it's logical to conclude that `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` should have a similar access control level to the provided APIs due to its involvement in system-level notification handling and potential interaction with sensitive user data.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
