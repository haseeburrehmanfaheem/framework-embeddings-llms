To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method seems to be part of a notification handling system, likely within an Android environment given the context (e.g., `enforceStatusBarService`, `Binder.clearCallingIdentity`, etc.). It takes parameters related to a notification's expansion state and possibly its position or type.

2. **Access Control Choices**:
   - **NONE**: Typically used for methods that do not pose any security risks.
   - **NORMAL**: For methods that require some level of access control but are generally safe when used appropriately.
   - **DANGEROUS**: Methods that can cause harm if misused, such as those dealing with sensitive user data or system modifications.
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: This is for system or signature-level permissions, typically required by methods that interact closely with the system's core functionalities or sensitive operations.

3. **Analysis of Similar APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getBackupPayload` and `onBiometricError`) have an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG**. The similarity in scores suggests these methods share significant operational similarities with `onNotificationExpansionChanged`, possibly in terms of system-level interactions or the sensitivity of data they handle.

4. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method calls `p0.enforceStatusBarService();` which implies it's checking if the calling service is legitimate or authorized to interact with status bar services, a system-level functionality.
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2);`, indicating it deals with inter-process communication (IPC) in a way that temporarily masks the caller's identity. This suggests an operation that might require system-level access or at least careful management of permissions to avoid security breaches.

5. **Conclusion**:
Given the method's interaction with system services, its need to enforce specific service checks, and the similarity with other APIs classified as **SYS_OR_SIG**, it is reasonable to conclude that `onNotificationExpansionChanged` also requires a system or signature-level permission to operate securely within the Android framework.

Therefore, the access control level for `onNotificationExpansionChanged` should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
