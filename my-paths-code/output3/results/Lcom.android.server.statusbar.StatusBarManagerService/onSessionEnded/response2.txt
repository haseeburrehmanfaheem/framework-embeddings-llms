To determine the access control level for the `onSessionEnded` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `onSessionEnded` method calls `this.mSessionMonitor.onSessionEnded(p1, p2);`, which indicates it interacts with a session monitor.
   - It also checks for setter permissions and validates the session type, suggesting some level of access control or validation.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `registerSessionListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to session management (like registering listeners or ending sessions) might require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on the system's security and functionality.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: No permission required. Given the method's interaction with system components (session monitor), this seems unlikely.
   - `NORMAL`: Permission that can be granted to normal applications. This might not apply if the operation is sensitive or requires elevated permissions.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Permissions that can potentially affect the user's privacy or the device's security, requiring explicit user consent. While session management could impact system behavior, it doesn't directly imply dangerous operations like accessing personal data.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Permissions that are only granted to applications signed with the platform key or have a specific signature. Given the similarity with `registerSessionListener` and the potential for impacting system security or functionality, this level seems plausible.

Considering these points:
- The method's operation (`onSessionEnded`) is related to managing sessions, which can be a sensitive operation from a system perspective.
- The similar API (`registerSessionListener`) has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that such operations are restricted and require either system-level permissions or a specific signature.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's interaction with system components and the similarity in access control levels with related APIs, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `onSessionEnded` method. This reflects its potential impact on system functionality and security.
