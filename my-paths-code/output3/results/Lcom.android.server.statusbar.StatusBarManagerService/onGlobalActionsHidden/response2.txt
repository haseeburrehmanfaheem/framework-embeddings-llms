To determine the access control level for the `onGlobalActionsHidden` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `onGlobalActionsHidden` calls `enforceStatusBarService()`, which suggests that it is checking if the caller has the necessary permissions or status to perform actions related to the status bar service.
   - It then proceeds to call `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)`. This pair of calls is typically used to clear and restore the calling identity, respectively. Clearing the calling identity is often done when a process needs to perform an operation that should not be attributed to the original caller, ensuring that any permissions checks are done based on the process's own identity rather than the caller's.
   - The method also invokes `this.mGlobalActionListener.onGlobalActionsDismissed()`, indicating that it is handling global actions being dismissed.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves clearing and restoring the calling identity around the invocation of `onGlobalActionsDismissed`. This pattern suggests that the operation (in this case, notifying about global actions being dismissed) should be executed in a context where permissions are checked based on the process's identity rather than the original caller's.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `onGlobalActionsShown()` has a high similarity score and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also involves clearing and restoring calling identities around notifying about global actions being shown, similar to `onGlobalActionsHidden`.
   - Another similar API, `restart()`, although with a lower similarity score, also uses the clear and restore calling identity pattern without performing any specific action within this context. It is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

**Conclusion**:
Given that both similar APIs (`onGlobalActionsShown` and `restart`) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` as their access control levels, and considering that `onGlobalActionsHidden` follows a similar pattern of clearing and restoring the calling identity (which typically requires system or signature level permissions to ensure secure execution), it's logical to assign `onGlobalActionsHidden` the same access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
