To determine the access control level for the `onGlobalActionsShown` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `onGlobalActionsShown` method calls `p0.enforceStatusBarService()`, which suggests that it is checking if the caller has the necessary permissions or status related to the status bar service.
   - It then clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and calls `this.mGlobalActionListener.onGlobalActionsShown()` before restoring the calling identity. This pattern indicates that it is performing some action on behalf of another component, possibly with elevated privileges.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves clearing the calling identity and then notifying a listener about global actions being shown. Clearing the calling identity typically allows the process to perform operations without attributing them to the original caller, which can be related to system-level operations or sensitive actions.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs (`onGlobalActionsHidden()` and `restart()`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are either restricted to system processes or require a signature permission, indicating they perform operations that are either system-level or sensitive.
   - The similarity in code patterns (clearing and restoring calling identity) between `onGlobalActionsShown` and the similar APIs (`onGlobalActionsHidden()` and `restart()`) implies that `onGlobalActionsShown` might also be involved in system-level or sensitive operations.

Given these observations, it seems reasonable to conclude that `onGlobalActionsShown` should have a similar access control level due to its involvement with system-level operations (notifying about global actions) and the use of clearing and restoring calling identity, which is indicative of operations that require careful permission management.

Therefore, considering the patterns observed in similar APIs and the nature of the operations performed by `onGlobalActionsShown`, the most appropriate access control level would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
