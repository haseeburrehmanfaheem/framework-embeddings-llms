To determine the access control level for the `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method uses `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity` which is a mechanism to perform operations with the calling identity cleared. This suggests that the operation might not require specific permissions related to the caller's identity but does imply some level of system interaction.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9946724772453308) and is assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. The operation involves adding a listener, which typically does not require dangerous permissions but might need normal permissions to ensure that the addition is legitimate and properly managed.
   - **setVcnConfig**: With a slightly lower similarity score (0.9886142611503601) but still very high, this API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system-level permissions or signature-level permissions. This suggests that configuring VCN settings is considered sensitive and thus restricted to system apps or those signed with the platform key.

Given these observations:
- The `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` method interacts closely with system services (as indicated by `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`) but does not seem to directly manipulate sensitive data like configuration settings.
- Its closest similar API, `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, has a `NORMAL` access control level, suggesting that listener management is considered a less sensitive operation compared to configuring VCN settings.

Considering the method's functionality and its similarity to other APIs, it seems reasonable to conclude that removing a listener, while potentially requiring some form of permission or system interaction, does not rise to the level of sensitivity ascribed to `SYS_OR_SIG` operations like setting configurations. Thus, an access control level of `NORMAL` would be appropriate for `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, aligning with the management of listeners without directly impacting system settings.

**Access Control Level Decision**: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
This decision reflects the method's operational context, its similarity to other listener management APIs, and the implication that while some permission or system interaction is required, it does not necessitate the elevated access control levels associated with system or signature-level permissions.
