To determine the access control level for the `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels. The provided API, `requestBroadcastInfo`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permissions to be invoked.

1. **Analysis of sendTvInputNotifyIntent**:
   - This method sends a broadcast intent related to TV input notifications.
   - It uses `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the PID and UID of the calling process, which are then used in resolving the calling user ID through `resolveCallingUserId`.
   - The resolved user ID is used to send the broadcast as that specific user via `sendBroadcastAsUser`.
   - This implies a level of interaction with system-level services and potentially sensitive operations (broadcasting intents), suggesting it may require some form of access control.

2. **Comparison with requestBroadcastInfo**:
   - Both methods deal with TV input management.
   - They both resolve the calling user ID using `resolveCallingUserId`, indicating similar handling of user context.
   - The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` in both APIs suggests they are verifying the caller's identity, which is a common practice when enforcing access control.
   - Given that `requestBroadcastInfo` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it implies that operations related to TV input management might require system or signature-level permissions for security and privacy reasons.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Considering the similarities in functionality, user ID resolution, and caller verification between `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` and `requestBroadcastInfo`, it is reasonable to infer that `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` would also require a similar level of access control.
   - The method's interaction with system-level components (e.g., sending broadcasts as specific users) further supports the need for restricted access.

Based on this analysis, the appropriate access control level for `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` is likely to be `SYS_OR_SIG`, given its functional similarities with `requestBroadcastInfo` and the nature of operations it performs.
