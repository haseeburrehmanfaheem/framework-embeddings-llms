To determine the access control level for the `isRatingBlocked` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `isRatingBlocked` method checks if a specific TV content rating is blocked for a given user. It uses the `TvInputManagerService` to resolve the calling user ID and then retrieves the user state and persistent data store associated with that user. Finally, it checks if the specified TV content rating is blocked in the user's blocked ratings.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `unregisterCallback`: This method has a similarity score of 0.9961750507354736 and an access control level of NONE. However, its code snippet only shows the creation of a new `TvInputManagerService$UserState` object and adding it to the `mUserStates` map, which is not directly related to the functionality of `isRatingBlocked`.

2. `removeBlockedRating`: This method has a similarity score of 0.9731816053390503 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code snippet shows that it resolves the calling user ID, retrieves the user state and persistent data store, unflattens the TV content rating from a string, and then removes the blocked rating from the user's blocked ratings.

Comparing the code snippets of `isRatingBlocked` with the similar APIs, we can see that `isRatingBlocked` follows a similar pattern as `removeBlockedRating`. It resolves the calling user ID, retrieves the user state and persistent data store, unflattens the TV content rating from a string, and then checks if the rating is blocked.

However, unlike `removeBlockedRating`, which modifies the user's blocked ratings, `isRatingBlocked` only reads the blocked ratings without making any changes. This suggests that `isRatingBlocked` does not require the same level of access control as `removeBlockedRating`.

Considering the similarities and differences between `isRatingBlocked` and the similar APIs, we can conclude that the access control level for `isRatingBlocked` should be NORMAL. This is because it only reads the user's blocked ratings without making any changes, which does not require the highest level of access control (SYS_OR_SIG) but still requires some level of control to ensure that the method is called with the correct user ID and permissions.

Here is the final access control level for the `isRatingBlocked` API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
