To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` API, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `getExtensionInterface` has a high similarity score (0.9062875509262085) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that similar operations involving extension interfaces or services might require system or signature-level permissions.
   - The API `getTvInputInfo` has a moderate similarity score (0.8402469158172607) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that not all TV input-related operations require strict access controls.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code for `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` involves resolving the calling user ID, getting or creating a user state locked object, accessing input maps, and interacting with service states. These operations are similar to those in the `getExtensionInterface` API.
   - The presence of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` suggests that the method is concerned with identifying and potentially restricting access based on the caller's identity, which aligns more closely with the behavior of `SYS_OR_SIG` level APIs.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not pose a risk or require no special permissions to execute.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that require standard permissions that most apps can declare in their manifests.
   - `DANGEROUS`: For operations that could potentially harm the user's data, privacy, etc., and thus require explicit user consent via permissions.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-level operations or those requiring signature-level permissions, typically out of reach for regular third-party apps.

Given these considerations:

- The high similarity with `getExtensionInterface` (access control level: `SYS_OR_SIG`) suggests that `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` might also require a higher access control level due to its involvement with extension interfaces and services.
- The interaction with system-level components (e.g., resolving calling user IDs, accessing service states) further supports the need for a stricter access control.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of similar APIs, code operations, and the nature of access controls in Android, `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` likely requires a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to its system-level interactions and potential impact on device functionality or user data privacy.
