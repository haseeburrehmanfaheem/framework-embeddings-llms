After carefully analyzing the provided Java code for the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here are my findings:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int v4 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(this.this$0, v3, v2, p2, \"getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames\");",
      "TvInputManagerService$UserState v7 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked(this.this$0, v4);",
      "Map v8 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetinputMap(v7);",
      "Object v9 = v8.get(p1);",
      "TvInputInfo v11 = TvInputManagerService$TvInputState.-$$Nest$fgetinfo(v9);"
    ],
    [
      "ITvInputService v15 = TvInputManagerService$ServiceState.-$$Nest$fgetservice(v13);",
      "boolean v14 = TvInputManagerService$ServiceState.-$$Nest$fgetisHardware(v13);",
      "ArrayList v16 = new ArrayList();"
    ],
    [
      "List v18 = phiInstruction.getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames();",
      "List v19 = CollectionUtils.emptyIfNull(v18);",
      "Iterator v20 = v19.iterator();",
      "String v22 = phiInstruction.getExtensionInterfacePermission(v21);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each identified sink:

1. The first sink is related to the resolution of the calling user ID and the retrieval of the input map for the user state. This sink involves multiple method invocations and field accesses that process the input parameters `p1` and `p2`.
2. The second sink is related to the retrieval of the ITV input service and the check for hardware availability. Although this sink seems less sensitive, it still processes data related to the API's input parameters.
3. The third sink is related to the iteration over the available extension interface names and the retrieval of permissions for each interface. This sink involves method invocations that return sensitive data.

Note that I have ranked these sinks based on their sensitivity and potential impact on access control, with the first sink being the most critical due to its involvement in user ID resolution and input map retrieval.
