To determine the access control level for the `addBlockedRating` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `addBlockedRating` method is used to add a blocked rating to the TV input manager service. It first checks the parental controls permission using the `ensureParentalControlsPermission` method. Then, it resolves the calling user ID using the `resolveCallingUserId` method and gets or creates a user state locked object using the `getOrCreateUserStateLocked` method. Finally, it adds the blocked rating to the persistent data store using the `addBlockedRating` method.

The similar APIs provided are `removeBlockedRating` and `isRatingBlocked`. The `removeBlockedRating` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permission to execute. This method is similar to `addBlockedRating` in terms of its functionality, as it also modifies the blocked ratings in the TV input manager service.

On the other hand, the `isRatingBlocked` method has an access control level of `NONE`, which means it does not require any special permissions to execute. This method is different from `addBlockedRating` in terms of its functionality, as it only checks if a rating is blocked, rather than modifying the blocked ratings.

Considering the similarities and differences between these methods, we can conclude that the `addBlockedRating` method requires system or signature-level permission to execute, as it modifies the blocked ratings in the TV input manager service. This is consistent with the access control level of the `removeBlockedRating` method.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `addBlockedRating` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
