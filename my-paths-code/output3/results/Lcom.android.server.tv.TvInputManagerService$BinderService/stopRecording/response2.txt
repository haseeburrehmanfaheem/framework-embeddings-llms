To assign an access control level to the `stopRecording` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `stopRecording` method has three paths with depth 2, but they all share the same key elements:
1. It calls `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId` to resolve the calling user ID.
2. It uses `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked` to get an `ITvInputSession` object.
3. It calls the `stopRecording` method on the `ITvInputSession` object.

The similar APIs, `startRecording` and `resumeRecording`, have the same access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`) and share similar code patterns:
1. They also call `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId` to resolve the calling user ID.
2. They use `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked` to get an `ITvInputSession` object.
3. They call a method on the `ITvInputSession` object (`startRecording` or `resumeRecording`, respectively).

Given these similarities, it's reasonable to conclude that the `stopRecording` method should have the same access control level as the similar APIs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }}$
