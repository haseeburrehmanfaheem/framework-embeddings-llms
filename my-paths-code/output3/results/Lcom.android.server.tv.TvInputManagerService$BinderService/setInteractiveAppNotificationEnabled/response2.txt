To determine the access control level for the `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**: The given similar APIs (`timeShiftEnablePositionTracking` and `timeShiftPause`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that methods related to TV input management services, especially those involving session management and interaction with `ITvInputSession`, tend to require system or signature-level permissions. These permissions are typically reserved for system apps or apps signed with the platform key, indicating that these operations are sensitive and should only be performed by trusted entities.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippets provided for `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` show a pattern similar to the similar APIs mentioned:
   - It resolves the calling user ID using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId`.
   - It retrieves an `ITvInputSession` instance through `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked`.
   - It then calls a method on the `ITvInputSession` object (`setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` in this case).

3. **Access Control Implications**: Given that both similar APIs require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control and considering the operational similarity (involving user ID resolution, session locking, and interaction with an `ITvInputSession`), it's reasonable to infer that `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` also requires a similar level of access control. This is because all these operations are part of managing TV input sessions, which can impact system functionality and user experience, thus necessitating restricted access.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the similarity in functionality with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, and considering the sensitive nature of interacting with TV input sessions, it's logical to conclude that `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
