To determine the access control level for the `getTvInputInfo` API, we should consider its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `createSession` and `getTvInputList`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`.

1. **Similarity with `createSession`**: This API has a high similarity score (0.953310489654541) with `getTvInputInfo`. Both methods involve resolving the calling user ID using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId`, getting or creating a user state locked with `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked`, and then accessing a map related to TV input states. Given that `createSession` has an access control level of `NONE`, this suggests that the operations performed by `getTvInputInfo` might also be considered safe or not sensitive enough to require higher access control levels.

2. **Similarity with `getTvInputList`**: This API also shares a significant similarity (0.9090855717658997) with `getTvInputInfo`. Both methods resolve the calling user ID and get or create a user state locked, which are key steps in managing TV input services securely. Since `getTvInputList` is assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it further supports the notion that `getTvInputInfo` may not require stringent access controls.

3. **Analysis of Sinks**: The provided sink code indicates that `getTvInputInfo` involves accessing TV input information based on user IDs and states, which could be considered sensitive operations. However, given the similarities with other APIs that have `NONE` access control levels, it seems these operations are handled in a way that does not expose significant risks or vulnerabilities.

Considering these points, the access control level for `getTvInputInfo` can be inferred to be similar to its counterparts, which suggests that it should also be classified as `NONE`. This classification implies that the method's operations are either not sensitive or are handled securely enough not to pose a significant risk, aligning with how similar APIs are treated.
