To determine the access control level for the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method has the following key aspects:

1. It calls `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`, which suggests that it is checking the caller's identity.
2. It uses `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId` to resolve the calling user ID, which is similar to the `setSurface` and `timeShiftPause` APIs.
3. It clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and then restores it later, which indicates that it is performing some operation that requires elevated privileges.
4. It interacts with a session state object (`TvInputManagerService$SessionState`) and an input session object (`ITvInputSession`), which suggests that it is managing TV input sessions.

Comparing this method with the similar APIs:

* `setSurface`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9076 and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also resolves the calling user ID, clears the calling identity, and interacts with a user state object.
* `timeShiftPause`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8206 and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also resolves the calling user ID and interacts with an input session object.

Based on these similarities, it appears that the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method requires a similar level of access control as the `setSurface` and `timeShiftPause` APIs. Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
