To determine the access control level for the `removeOverlayView` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs. 

The provided code snippets show that `removeOverlayView` follows a pattern where it:
1. Retrieves the calling UID and PID.
2. Resolves the calling user ID using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId`.
3. Gets a session locked using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked`.
4. Calls `removeOverlayView` on the `ITvInputSession` object.

The similar APIs, `timeShiftPause` and `timeShiftEnablePositionTracking`, also follow this pattern and have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the operations performed by these methods are system- or signature-protected, meaning they can only be invoked by applications with specific permissions or system components.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality between `removeOverlayView` and the provided similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `removeOverlayView` should have a similar access control level. 

Therefore, based on the pattern observed and the access control levels of similar APIs, the final access control level for the `removeOverlayView` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
