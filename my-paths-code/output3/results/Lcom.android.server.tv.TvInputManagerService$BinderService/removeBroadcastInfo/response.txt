After carefully examining the provided code for the `removeBroadcastInfo` API, I have identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int v3 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(this.this$0, v2, v1, p3, \"removeBroadcastInfo\");",
      "public int -$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(TvInputManagerService p1, int p2, int p3, int p4, String p5){",
      "int v1 = p1.resolveCallingUserId(p2, p3, p4, p5);",
      "public int resolveCallingUserId(int p1, int p2, int p3, String p4){",
      "int v1 = ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser(p1, p2, p3, 0, 0, p4, 0);"
    ],
    [
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v6 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionStateLocked(this.this$0, p1, v1, v3);",
      "public TvInputManagerService$SessionState -$$Nest$mgetSessionStateLocked(TvInputManagerService p1, IBinder p2, int p3, int p4){",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v1 = p1.getSessionStateLocked(p2, p3, p4);",
      "public TvInputManagerService$SessionState getSessionStateLocked(IBinder p1, int p2, int p3){",
      "TvInputManagerService$UserState v1 = p0.getOrCreateUserStateLocked(p3);",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v2 = p0.getSessionStateLocked(p1, p2, v1);"
    ],
    [
      "ITvInputSession v7 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked(this.this$0, v6);",
      "public ITvInputSession -$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked(TvInputManagerService p1, TvInputManagerService$SessionState p2){",
      "ITvInputSession v1 = p1.getSessionLocked(p2);",
      "public ITvInputSession getSessionLocked(TvInputManagerService$SessionState p1){",
      "ITvInputSession v1 = TvInputManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fgetsession(p1);"
    ],
    [
      "v7.removeBroadcastInfo(p2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact and data flow. The first sink is related to the `resolveCallingUserId` method, which handles user IDs and has a high naming similarity with the API name. The second sink is related to the `getSessionStateLocked` method, which accesses session states and has a moderate naming similarity with the API name. The third sink is related to the `getSessionLocked` method, which accesses sessions and has a low naming similarity with the API name. The fourth sink is a single instruction that calls the `removeBroadcastInfo` method on the `ITvInputSession` object.

Note that some instructions may be part of multiple sinks due to their involvement in different data flows or method invocations. However, each instruction is only listed once in the JSON output to maintain clarity and avoid redundancy.
