To assign an access control level to the `removeBroadcastInfo` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `removeBroadcastInfo` method has three paths, but they all have similar code structures. The method calls `resolveCallingUserId` to get the user ID of the caller, then uses this ID to get a session state locked object, and finally removes broadcast info from an `ITvInputSession` object.

The sink code provided shows that the method interacts with the `ActivityManager` to handle incoming users and gets a session state locked object. This suggests that the method is related to managing TV input sessions and requires some level of access control.

The similar APIs provided, `relayoutOverlayView` and `createOverlayView`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the `ActivityManager` and get session state locked objects, which is similar to the behavior of `removeBroadcastInfo`.

Given these similarities, it's reasonable to assign the same access control level to `removeBroadcastInfo`. Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This access control level suggests that the method requires system or signature-level permission to execute, which is consistent with its behavior of managing TV input sessions and interacting with the `ActivityManager`.
