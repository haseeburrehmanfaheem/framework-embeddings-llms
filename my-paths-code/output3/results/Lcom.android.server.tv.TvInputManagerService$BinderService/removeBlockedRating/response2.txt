To determine the access control level for the `removeBlockedRating` method, we should analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The `removeBlockedRating` method is designed to remove a specific content rating from the list of blocked ratings.
   - It involves checking parental controls permission (`ensureParentalControlsPermission`), resolving the calling user ID, getting or creating a user state for that ID, and then removing the specified rating from the blocked ratings stored in the persistent data store.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **isRatingBlocked**: This method checks if a given content rating is blocked for a specific user. It has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - **getBlockedRatings**: This method retrieves the list of blocked content ratings for a user. Like `isRatingBlocked`, it also has an access control level of `NONE`.

Given that both similar methods (`isRatingBlocked` and `getBlockedRatings`) have an access control level of `NONE`, we can infer that operations related to managing or querying blocked content ratings do not require elevated permissions beyond the standard checks (like resolving the calling user ID).

However, the method in question, `removeBlockedRating`, involves modifying the list of blocked ratings, which could potentially be considered a more sensitive operation than simply querying the status of a rating or retrieving the list of blocked ratings. Despite this, both provided similar APIs that interact with blocked ratings have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

**Conclusion**:
Given the similarity in functionality and the access control levels of the comparable methods (`isRatingBlocked` and `getBlockedRatings`), and considering that all these operations seem to be managed under similar constraints (resolving user IDs, interacting with user states, etc.), it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `removeBlockedRating`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
