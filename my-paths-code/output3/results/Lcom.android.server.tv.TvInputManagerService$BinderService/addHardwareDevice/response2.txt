To determine the access control level for the `addHardwareDevice` API, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

1. **API Behavior**: The `addHardwareDevice` method creates a new `TvInputHardwareInfo` object using a builder pattern, setting various properties like device ID, type, audio type, audio address, and HDMI port ID. It then uses this object to notify the `TvInputHardwareManager` about the availability of a new device.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **removeHardwareDevice(I)V**: This API has an access control level of NONE. It notifies the `TvInputHardwareManager` about a device becoming unavailable. The similarity in functionality (both deal with device availability) and the lack of sensitive information exposure suggest that `addHardwareDevice` could potentially have a similar access control level if it doesn't expose or modify sensitive data without proper authorization.
   - **getHardwareList()Ljava/util/List;**: This API has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating it requires signature or system-level permission to access the list of hardware devices. The difference in access control levels between this and `removeHardwareDevice` suggests that listing hardware might require higher privileges due to potential security implications (e.g., exposing device details).

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `addHardwareDevice` method, like `removeHardwareDevice`, does not seem to directly expose sensitive information or perform actions that would typically require elevated permissions (such as modifying system settings or accessing private user data). However, adding a hardware device could potentially have security implications if the device is not properly validated.
   - Unlike `getHardwareList()`, which returns a list of devices and thus might need protection against unauthorized access, `addHardwareDevice` initiates an action based on provided parameters without returning sensitive information.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that `addHardwareDevice` does not directly return or expose sensitive information but rather initiates an action (notifying about device availability), its access control level would likely be closer to that of `removeHardwareDevice`. However, considering the potential implications of adding a new device without proper validation, it might still require some form of control. The most fitting choice seems to be **NONE**, assuming the system has other mechanisms in place to validate and secure the addition of hardware devices.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
However, given the nature of the task and the analysis provided, if we strictly follow the similarities with `removeHardwareDevice` without considering additional security implications not explicitly mentioned, the access control might indeed lean towards **NONE**. But since adding hardware can have more profound system implications (security, compatibility), leaning towards a slightly higher level of control such as **NORMAL** seems prudent unless specified otherwise by specific Android documentation or guidelines related to TV input hardware management.

Given this analysis and sticking strictly to provided choices without over-assuming security implications not covered:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
Yet, acknowledging the nature of device addition and typical system security practices, **NORMAL** could be argued as a more cautious approach if additional context or sensitivity is implied.
