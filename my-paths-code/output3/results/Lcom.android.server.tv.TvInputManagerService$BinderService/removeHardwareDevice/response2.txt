To assign an access control level to the `removeHardwareDevice` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `removeHardwareDevice` method has two paths, both of which lead to the `onDeviceUnavailable` method in `TvInputHardwareManager`. This method removes a device from the connections list, resets the device, and sends a message to the handler. The method also calls `buildHardwareListLocked`, which clears the hardware list.

The similar APIs provided are `addHardwareDevice` and `getHardwareList`. 

- `addHardwareDevice` has an access control level of `NONE` and adds a new device to the `TvInputHardwareManager`.
- `getHardwareList` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that it requires system or signature-level permission. This method returns the list of available hardware devices.

Comparing these APIs, we can see that `removeHardwareDevice` has a similar interaction with `TvInputHardwareManager` as `addHardwareDevice` and `getHardwareList`. However, removing a hardware device could potentially have security implications, such as preventing a device from functioning properly or disrupting the system's functionality.

Given this analysis, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `removeHardwareDevice`, as it is similar to `getHardwareList` in terms of its interaction with the system and potential security implications. However, considering that `addHardwareDevice` has a level of `NONE` and `removeHardwareDevice` is essentially performing an opposite operation which might not require high-level access control for its basic functionality but could still affect system resources, we need to weigh these factors.

Ultimately, considering the operations involved in `removeHardwareDevice`, such as removing devices from connections and resetting them, which are more about managing system resources rather than accessing sensitive information or performing dangerous operations, it aligns more closely with operations that require careful handling but not necessarily at the highest access control levels. 

However, given the context of system management and potential impact on device functionality, and comparing with provided similar APIs where `getHardwareList` is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, a conservative approach would be to consider it as requiring system or signature level permission due to its implications on system resources and hardware management.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
