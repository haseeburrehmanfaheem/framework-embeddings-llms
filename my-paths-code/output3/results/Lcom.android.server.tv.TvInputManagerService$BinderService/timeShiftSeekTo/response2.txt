To determine the access control level for the `timeShiftSeekTo` method, we can analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**: The similar APIs (`timeShiftPause` and `timeShiftResume`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the same sinks (e.g., resolving the calling user ID and getting a session locked) as the `timeShiftSeekTo` method.
2. **Sink Code**: The sink code for `timeShiftSeekTo` involves resolving the calling user ID, getting a session locked, and then performing an action (`timeShiftSeekTo`) on that session. This pattern is consistent with the similar APIs, which also perform actions (`timeShiftPause` and `timeShiftResume`) after resolving the user ID and locking the session.
3. **Access Control Semantics**: The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that an API can be accessed by system processes or applications signed with the same certificate as the application providing the API (signature). Given the nature of TV input management services, which often require privileged access to manage TV sessions and time shifting functionality, this level seems appropriate.

Considering these points:

- The similar APIs (`timeShiftPause` and `timeShiftResume`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The interaction with sinks (resolving the calling user ID and getting a session locked) is consistent across these methods.
- The nature of TV input management services suggests that privileged or system-level access is necessary for such operations.

Therefore, it's logical to assign the same access control level to `timeShiftSeekTo` as its similar APIs.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
