Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `requestBroadcastInfo`, I've analyzed the code to identify potential sinks that require access control.

Here's the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int v3 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(this.this$0, v2, v1, p3, \"requestBroadcastInfo\");",
      "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int v2 = Binder.getCallingPid();"
    ],
    [
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v6 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionStateLocked(this.this$0, p1, v1, v3);",
      "ITvInputSession v7 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked(this.this$0, v6);"
    ],
    [
      "v7.requestBroadcastInfo(p2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive. The first sink set includes the instructions that resolve the calling user ID and retrieve the calling UID and PID. This information is used to authenticate and authorize the request.

The second sink set includes the instructions that retrieve the session state locked and get the session locked, which are used to manage the session and ensure proper access control.

The third sink set includes the instruction that requests broadcast info from the `ITvInputSession` object, which is a potential sink as it may propagate sensitive information or perform actions based on the input parameters.

Note that the logging method `Slog.e` is not considered a sink as it is used for debugging purposes and does not propagate sensitive information. Similarly, auxiliary operations like obtaining an instance of a class or accessing context objects are not considered sinks.
