To determine the access control level for the `requestBroadcastInfo` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `requestBroadcastInfo` method involves several steps, including resolving the calling user ID using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId`, getting a session state locked with `TvInputManagerService$SessionState`, and then getting an `ITvInputSession` to call `requestBroadcastInfo` on it. This process includes checks for the calling UID and PID, which are indicators of access control.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets provided show interactions with `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`, indicating that the method is concerned with identifying and possibly restricting based on the caller's identity. Additionally, the use of `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId` suggests a level of access control related to user management.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `removeBroadcastInfo` API has a similarity score of 0.8851996064186096 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also resolves the calling user ID, similar to `requestBroadcastInfo`, indicating a potentially similar access control requirement due to their functional similarity.
   - The `requestChannelBrowsable` API has a lower similarity score of 0.8738863468170166 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Although it also deals with resolving the calling user ID, its access control level is less restrictive.

Given these points, we can infer that:
- The method involves checks for the caller's identity (UID and PID) and resolves the calling user ID, suggesting some level of access control.
- The similarity with `removeBroadcastInfo`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggests that `requestBroadcastInfo` might require a similar or at least significant level of access control due to their functional similarities and the involvement of user ID resolution.

However, without explicit indications of dangerous operations (like those requiring `DANGEROUS` permissions) or system/signature-level restrictions directly in the provided code snippets for `requestBroadcastInfo`, we lean towards an access control level that reflects its need to manage and restrict access based on user identity but does not explicitly indicate a `SYS_OR_SIG` requirement as seen with `removeBroadcastInfo`.

Given the information and focusing on the method's involvement with user management and session state, which might imply a need for protection against unauthorized access or misuse, but without clear indications of it being system-level or signature protected like `removeBroadcastInfo`, we would consider an access control level that reflects its operational context.

**Access Control Decision**: Considering the above analysis, the access control level for `requestBroadcastInfo` could be considered as `NORMAL`. This decision is based on the method's involvement in managing sessions and user IDs without explicit indications of requiring system or signature-level protection. However, this might need adjustment based on the broader context of the application and specific security requirements not fully detailed in the provided information.
