To determine the access control level for the `setCaptionEnabled` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs. The provided code snippets show that `setCaptionEnabled` interacts with the `TvInputManagerService` and `ITvInputSession` interfaces, which are related to TV input management.

The sink code indicates that the API resolves the calling user ID using `resolveCallingUserId` and then retrieves an `ITvInputSession` object using `getSessionLocked`. Finally, it calls `setCaptionEnabled` on the `ITvInputSession` object.

Comparing this with the similar API `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`, we can see that both APIs follow a similar pattern:

1. Resolve the calling user ID using `resolveCallingUserId`.
2. Retrieve an `ITvInputSession` object using `getSessionLocked`.
3. Call a method on the `ITvInputSession` object (either `setCaptionEnabled` or `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`).

The access control level for `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` is `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that this API requires either system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities between the two APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `setCaptionEnabled` also requires a similar level of access control. Therefore, the access control level for `setCaptionEnabled` should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
