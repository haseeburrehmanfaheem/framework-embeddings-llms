To determine the access control level for the `isSingleSessionActive` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `isSingleSessionActive` method:
- Calls `ensureCaptureTvInputPermission()`, which does nothing in the given code snippets.
- Uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)` to manage calling identity, indicating it's working within a specific security context.
- Resolves the calling user ID using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId`.
- Gets or creates a user state locked with `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked`.
- Accesses the session state map of the user state.

The similar APIs provided are:
1. `createSession(Landroid/media/tv/ITvInputClient;Ljava/lang/String;ZII)V` with an access control level of `NONE`. This method also resolves the calling user ID and gets or creates a user state, but it interacts with input maps rather than session states directly.
2. `tune(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/net/Uri;Landroid/os/Bundle;I)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves resolving the calling user ID, getting sessions locked, and interacting with session states, which is closer to what `isSingleSessionActive` does in terms of accessing sensitive information.

Given these observations:
- The method `isSingleSessionActive` interacts with session state maps and resolves calling user IDs, similar to `tune`, but it doesn't seem to perform any actions that directly modify system states or require significant privileges like `tune` might (given its access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`).
- The method's purpose appears to be checking a condition (`isSingleSessionActive`) rather than performing an action, which typically requires less privilege.
- However, it does involve getting user states and session information, suggesting some level of access control is necessary.

Considering the similarity scores and the nature of operations:
- `createSession` has a lower access control requirement (`NONE`) but involves creating sessions.
- `tune` requires `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating higher privilege due to its potential impact on system state or security.

Given that `isSingleSessionActive` is more about checking a status rather than modifying it, and considering the operations involved (accessing session states without explicit modification), it seems reasonable to conclude that this method would not require the highest level of access control like `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, since it does deal with user-specific session information, some form of access control is necessary.

Therefore, a balanced approach would be to assign an access control level that reflects its need for accessing potentially sensitive information without the ability to modify critical system states directly. Given the options provided (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), and considering it doesn't seem to fit the highest or lowest levels of access control based on its functionality, the most appropriate level seems to be `NORMAL`. This reflects a moderate need for access control without indicating that it can cause significant harm if misused (like `DANGEROUS`) or requiring system-level privileges (`SYS_OR_SIG`).
