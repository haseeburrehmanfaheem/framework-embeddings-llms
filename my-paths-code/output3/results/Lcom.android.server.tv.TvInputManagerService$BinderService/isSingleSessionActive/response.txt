To identify potential sinks in the provided API code for `isSingleSessionActive`, we need to analyze each path and apply the given positive rules. 

Given paths do not provide a clear return statement or an explicit creation of objects that directly utilize the input parameters (`p1`) or are named similarly to the API. However, we can still identify potential sinks based on method invocations and field accesses.

### Path Analysis

- **Method Invocations:** 
  - `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(this.this$0, v4, v3, p1, "isSingleSessionActive");` This has naming similarity with the API name and takes input parameters as arguments.
  - `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked(this.this$0, v5);` This method invocation is related to the API's functionality but does not directly take `p1` as an argument. However, its result is crucial for further operations.
- **Field Accesses:**
  - `TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetsessionStateMap(v7);` This field access has naming similarity with the API and is used in conjunction with other method invocations.

### Sinks Identification

Based on the positive rules provided:
1. Method invoked in the API, which have naming similarity or take input parameters.
2. Field get cases with naming similarity to the API name and are returned by the API or used with other sink cases.

Given these rules, potential sinks can be identified as follows:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "int v5 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(this.this$0, v4, v3, p1, \"isSingleSessionActive\");",
        "TvInputManagerService$UserState v7 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked(this.this$0, v5);",
        "Map v8 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetsessionStateMap(v7);"
    ]
]
}
```

This array represents a coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink. The `resolveCallingUserId` method invocation takes input parameters and has naming similarity with the API, contributing to it being considered a sink. The subsequent method invocations and field accesses (`getOrCreateUserStateLocked`, `sessionStateMap`) are directly influenced by the output of `resolveCallingUserId` or are part of the API's core functionality, linking them as part of this sink set.

Note that other parts of the code, like logging statements or auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining an instance of a class), do not contribute to potential sinks based on the provided negative rules.
