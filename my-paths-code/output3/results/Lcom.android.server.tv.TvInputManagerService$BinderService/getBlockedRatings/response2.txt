To determine the access control level for the `getBlockedRatings` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that interact with the same sinks. 

The `getBlockedRatings` method retrieves a list of blocked ratings from the `PersistentDataStore`. The similar API `removeBlockedRating` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permission to modify the blocked ratings. On the other hand, the `isRatingBlocked` API has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that it does not require any specific permission to check if a rating is blocked.

However, upon closer inspection of the code snippets for all three APIs (`getBlockedRatings`, `removeBlockedRating`, and `isRatingBlocked`), we can observe some key similarities:

1. **Resolve Calling User ID**: All three methods call `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId` to resolve the user ID, which is a common step for handling user-specific data.
2. **Get or Create User State Locked**: They all use `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked` to get or create a user state locked object, indicating they are dealing with user-state-related operations.
3. **Interaction with Persistent Data Store**: Each method interacts with the `PersistentDataStore`, either to remove a blocked rating, check if a rating is blocked, or retrieve blocked ratings.

The primary difference between these methods lies in their actions on the data:

- `removeBlockedRating` modifies the data by removing a blocked rating, which typically requires higher permission levels (`SYS_OR_SIG`) because it alters system settings.
- `isRatingBlocked` reads the data to check if a specific rating is blocked but does not modify any settings, hence requiring no special permissions (`NONE`).
- `getBlockedRatings` also reads the data, retrieving a list of all blocked ratings without modifying any system settings.

Given these observations, `getBlockedRatings` is more aligned with `isRatingBlocked` in terms of its read-only operation on the system settings. Since it does not modify any system settings but merely retrieves information, the access control level for `getBlockedRatings` should be similar to that of `isRatingBlocked`, which is `NONE`.

Therefore, considering the nature of the operation performed by `getBlockedRatings` and comparing it with the similar APIs provided, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
