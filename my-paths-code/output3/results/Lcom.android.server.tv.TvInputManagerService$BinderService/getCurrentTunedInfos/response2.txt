To determine the access control level for the `getCurrentTunedInfos` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `getTvInputInfo`: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It involves resolving the calling user ID, getting or creating a user state locked, and then retrieving a `TvInputInfo` object from the input map based on the provided string. The operations seem to be focused on information retrieval without directly implying sensitive operations.
   - `tune`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves resolving the calling user ID, getting or creating a session and user state locked, and then proceeding with tuning actions that likely require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on device functionality and privacy.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The `getCurrentTunedInfos` method also resolves the calling user ID and gets or creates a user state locked, similar to both `getTvInputInfo` and `tune`. However, it specifically deals with retrieving a list of currently tuned infos, which suggests an operation focused on information retrieval rather than altering system states or accessing sensitive data directly.

3. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   - The sink code snippet shows the method interacting with user state and session state maps but does not explicitly indicate operations that would require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions (e.g., no direct references to modifying system settings, accessing location, contacts, etc.).

Given these considerations:

- **getTvInputInfo** has a similarity score of 0.8606301546096802 with `getCurrentTunedInfos` and an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to retrieving information without significant privacy or security implications might not require elevated permissions.
- **tune** has a lower similarity score (0.838409423828125) but involves system or signature-level access (`SYS_OR_SIG`) due to its nature of altering states, which is not directly implied in `getCurrentTunedInfos`.

Considering the above points and focusing on the information retrieval nature of `getCurrentTunedInfos` without explicit indications of requiring system, signature, or dangerous permissions for its operation, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects its operational scope.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the specific operations involved in `getCurrentTunedInfos`, the assigned access control level would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice leans towards recognizing the method's need for some form of access control due to its interaction with system services and user states, but without explicit evidence suggesting it requires the most restrictive permissions (like `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS`), thus positioning it as requiring a standard or `NORMAL` level of access control.
