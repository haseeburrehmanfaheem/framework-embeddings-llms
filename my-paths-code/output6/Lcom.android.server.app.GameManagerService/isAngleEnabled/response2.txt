Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `isAngleEnabled` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `isAngleEnabled` method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `getApplicationInfoAsUser`: This method is used to retrieve information about a package.
2. `getGameModeConfiguration`: This method is used to retrieve game mode configuration for a package.

The similar APIs provided, `getGameModeInfo`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `getApplicationInfoAsUser` method and other related methods to retrieve game mode information.

Considering the similarity in functionality and the interaction with similar sinks, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `isAngleEnabled` method. This is because the method requires system or signature-level permission to access sensitive information about packages and their game mode configurations.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only authorized system or signature-level components can access the `isAngleEnabled` method, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.
