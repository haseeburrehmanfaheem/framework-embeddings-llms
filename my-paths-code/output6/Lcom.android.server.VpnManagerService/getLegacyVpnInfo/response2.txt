To determine the access control level for the `getLegacyVpnInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths, all of which involve checking if the VPN is settings-locked and then either returning a new `LegacyVpnInfo` object with certain properties set or not returning anything (in the case of path 1). The critical aspect here is the interaction with VPN settings and states.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate that the method creates a new `LegacyVpnInfo` object and sets its properties (`key`, `state`, and optionally `intent`) before returning it. This suggests that the method provides information about the current VPN state.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getProvisionedVpnProfileState**: Both instances of this API have an access control level of `NONE`. They calculate a state from the legacy state and return a new `VpnProfileState` object with this calculated state along with other parameters (`mAlwaysOn`, `mLockdown`). The similarity in functionality (both deal with VPN states and return objects containing these states) and the fact that they both have an access control level of `NONE` suggests that accessing or viewing VPN profile states is not considered sensitive enough to require higher access control levels.

Given this analysis, the key points are:
- The method interacts with VPN settings and states.
- It returns information about the VPN state without modifying it.
- Similar APIs that deal with VPN states have an access control level of `NONE`.

Based on these considerations, accessing legacy VPN info does not seem to pose a significant risk or require special permissions beyond what is normally accessible. Therefore, the most appropriate access control level for the `getLegacyVpnInfo` method would be `NONE`, as it aligns with the treatment of similar APIs that deal with viewing or retrieving VPN-related information.

**Access Control Level:**

{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
