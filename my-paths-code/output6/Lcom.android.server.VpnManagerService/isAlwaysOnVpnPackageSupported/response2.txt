To determine the access control level for the `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The similar APIs provided are `deleteVpnProfile` and `prepareVpn`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to VPN profiles and preparation are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The method checks if the caller is the system (`this.mDeps.isCallerSystem()`), indicating it expects system-level access for certain operations.
   - It interacts with `VpnProfileStore` and checks for specific metadata related to VPN services, which implies handling of sensitive data or configurations.
   - The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v6)` suggests the method is careful about the identity of the caller, further indicating sensitivity around permissions.

3. **Sink Code:**
   - The sink code involves getting a VPN profile store, checking for specific packages, and querying intent services related to VPNs. These operations are sensitive as they involve accessing and potentially modifying VPN configurations or service registrations.

Given these points, the `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported` method appears to be involved in sensitive operations related to VPN configuration and system-level checks. This aligns with the access control levels of the similar APIs (`SYS_OR_SIG`), which are also involved in VPN-related operations that require elevated permissions.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported` method should have an access control level that reflects its involvement in sensitive, system-level operations related to VPN configurations. Therefore, the appropriate access control level for this method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it requires either system or signature-level permissions to ensure that only authorized components can perform these sensitive operations.
