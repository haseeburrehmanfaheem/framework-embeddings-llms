After reviewing the provided code snippet and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `stopVpnProfile` API.

The `stopVpnProfile` API interacts with VPN-related sinks, such as `Vpn.isCurrentPreparedPackage`, `Vpn.getSessionKeyLocked`, `Vpn.makeVpnProfileStateLocked`, `Vpn.buildVpnManagerEventIntent`, `this.mVpnRunner.exit`, and `Vpn.notifyVpnManagerVpnStopped`. These sinks are related to VPN management and require careful access control.

The similar API `establishVpn` has an access control level of `NONE`, but it only checks if a package has the "android:activate_vpn" appop, which is not directly related to stopping a VPN profile. On the other hand, the similar API `setAlwaysOnVpnPackage` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permission.

Considering the semantics of the `stopVpnProfile` API and its interactions with VPN-related sinks, I believe it requires a moderate level of access control. The API is not as sensitive as `setAlwaysOnVpnPackage`, but it still needs to ensure that only authorized packages can stop a VPN profile.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `stopVpnProfile` API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the API requires a normal level of permission, which is higher than `NONE` but lower than `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS`.
