To determine the access control level for the `setAlwaysOnVpnPackage` method, we need to consider its functionality, the sensitivity of the data it handles, and how it interacts with other system components. This method appears to be involved in setting up and managing VPN (Virtual Private Network) connections on an Android device, specifically dealing with always-on VPN configurations.

1. **Functionality**: The method `setAlwaysOnVpnPackage` configures settings related to always-on VPNs, including specifying the package that should handle the VPN connection, lockdown mode, and potentially managing whitelists for applications allowed to bypass the VPN when in lockdown mode. It interacts with system services (like settings secure storage) and involves changes to network configuration.

2. **Sensitivity of Data**: The data handled by this method is sensitive because it pertains to network security configurations and could potentially expose the device or its data if misconfigured. Always-on VPNs are typically used in enterprise environments for securing all traffic from the device, making their setup and management a matter of significant security concern.

3. **Interaction with System Components**: The code snippets provided show interactions with various system components such as `LegacyVpnProfileStore`, `Vpn.getVpnProfilePrivileged`, and `settingsSecurePutStringForUser`. These interactions imply that the method has access to sensitive network configuration data and can modify settings that affect device-wide security posture.

Given these considerations, we look at similar APIs for guidance:

- **updateLockdownVpn()Z**: This API has a high similarity score with `setAlwaysOnVpnPackage` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The reason behind this could be its direct manipulation of lockdown VPN configurations, which requires system or signature-level permissions to ensure that only authorized components can alter such sensitive settings.

- **getProvisionedVpnProfileState(Ljava/lang/String;)Landroid/net/VpnProfileState;**: This API returns the state of a provisioned VPN profile and has an access control level of `NONE`. However, its functionality is more about querying the state rather than modifying it, which might not require elevated permissions.

Considering these factors:

- The method's ability to modify system settings related to network security (VPN configurations).
- Its interaction with sensitive data and system components.
- The high similarity score with an API that requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level (`updateLockdownVpn()`).

It is reasonable to conclude that the `setAlwaysOnVpnPackage` method should have a similar or higher level of access control due to its impact on device security configurations.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination is based on the method's functionality, the sensitivity of the data it handles, and comparisons with similar APIs that manage VPN-related settings. The `SYS_OR_SIG` designation reflects the need for system-level or signature-level permissions to execute this method securely, ensuring that modifications to always-on VPN configurations are only made by authorized components.
