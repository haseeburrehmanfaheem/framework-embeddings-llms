To determine the access control level for the `requestState` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels. The provided API has three paths with similar structures, interacting with the same sinks, and the semantics of those interactions are crucial for determining the appropriate access control level.

1. **Interaction with Sensitive Data**: The `requestState` method interacts with sensitive system state by calling `DeviceStateManagerService.getStateLocked(p2)`. This suggests it's dealing with potentially privileged or restricted information.

2. **Use of Binder and Calling Identity**: The API uses `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`, followed by `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v9)`. This indicates that the method is aware of the caller's identity and takes steps to manage it, which is a common practice when dealing with operations that require specific permissions or access levels.

3. **Comparison with Similar API**: The similar API `requestBaseStateOverride` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission. This API also interacts with the `DeviceStateManagerService` and adds a request to the override controller, similar to the `requestState` method.

Given these observations:
- The interaction with potentially sensitive state information (`DeviceStateManagerService.getStateLocked(p2)`).
- The management of caller identity, suggesting an awareness of security context.
- The similarity in functionality and access control level with `requestBaseStateOverride`, which is classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's interaction with system states, its awareness and handling of caller identities, and the comparison with a similar API that requires system or signature-level permission, it's reasonable to conclude that the `requestState` API should also be assigned an access control level that reflects its need for privileged access.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }}$
