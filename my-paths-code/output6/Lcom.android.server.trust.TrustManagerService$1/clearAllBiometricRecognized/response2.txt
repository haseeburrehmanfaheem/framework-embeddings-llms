To assign an access control level to the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method, we need to consider its functionality, the sinks it interacts with, and compare these aspects with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method appears to be involved in managing biometric recognition data. It takes two parameters: `p1` of type `BiometricSourceType` and `p2` of type `int`. The method clears the `mUsersUnlockedByBiometric` SparseBooleanArray, which suggests it is resetting or removing biometric unlock data for users. Additionally, it interacts with a Handler to send a message, potentially triggering further actions related to biometric unlocking.

The sinks involved in this method include:
1. `SparseBooleanArray v3 = this.mUsersUnlockedByBiometric; v3.clear();` - This line clears the array containing information about which users have been unlocked by biometrics.
2. The interaction with a Handler to send a message, potentially affecting biometric unlock status.

Comparing this method with similar APIs:
- `unlockedByBiometricForUser(ILandroid/hardware/biometrics/BiometricSourceType;)V` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method updates the unlock status for a specific user and biometric source type. Despite its similarity in parameters and general area of functionality, its access control is `NONE`, indicating it does not pose significant security risks or require elevated permissions.
- `unregisterTrustListener(Landroid/app/trust/ITrustListener;)V` also has an access control level of `NONE`. This method involves removing a trust listener, which is related to managing trust agents and their notifications. Its interaction with a Handler for sending messages is similar to the behavior in `clearAllBiometricRecognized`, but it deals with trust listeners rather than biometric data directly.

Given these comparisons:
- The primary action of `clearAllBiometricRecognized` (clearing biometric unlock data) does not inherently suggest a need for elevated permissions or access control beyond what is typical for managing user authentication data.
- The method's interaction with system components (like the Handler) to send messages could imply some level of privilege, but similar methods (`unregisterTrustListener`) that interact with Handlers also have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The similarity in functionality and parameters with other methods that have `NONE` access control levels suggests that `clearAllBiometricRecognized` might not require a higher access control level than `NONE`.

However, considering the potential impact on user authentication and security, one might argue for a cautious approach. Yet, based on the provided similar APIs and their access control levels, there's no strong indication that `clearAllBiometricRecognized` should have a more restrictive access control than `NONE`, especially given its direct actions are focused on clearing data rather than accessing sensitive information or performing dangerous operations.

Therefore, considering the functionality and comparisons with other APIs, the final access control level for the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision reflects the method's primary actions and the precedent set by similar methods in terms of access control levels.
