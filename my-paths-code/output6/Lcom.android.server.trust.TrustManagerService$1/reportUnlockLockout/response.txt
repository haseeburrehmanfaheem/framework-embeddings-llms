Based on the provided code for the `reportUnlockLockout` API with depth 1, let's analyze it step by step:

1. The method takes two parameters, `p1` and `p2`, which are directly used in creating a new `Message` object.
2. The `Handler v2 = this.mHandler;` line is an auxiliary operation to obtain an instance of a class (a handler), so it does not contribute to a sink following the negative rules.
3. The creation of a new `Message` object (`Message v3 = v2.obtainMessage(13, p1, p2);`) has direct data flow from the API parameters `p1` and `p2`. This matches one of the positive rules for object creation (created with data flow from the API parameters).
4. The `v3.sendToTarget();` method invocation is related to the handling of the message created in the previous step, but it does not return any value that would be considered sensitive or directly contribute to a sink based on the provided rules.

Given these observations, the instructions that collectively contribute to a potential sink are:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Message v3 = v2.obtainMessage(13, p1, p2);",
      "v3.sendToTarget();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This JSON represents a single set of instructions that form a potential sink due to the direct data flow from the API parameters `p1` and `p2` into the creation of the `Message` object. The `sendToTarget()` method is included as it acts on the message created with sensitive data, thus being part of the data flow chain.
