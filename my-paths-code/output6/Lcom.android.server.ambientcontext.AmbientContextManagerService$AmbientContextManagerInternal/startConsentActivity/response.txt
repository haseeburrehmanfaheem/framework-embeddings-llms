Based on the provided code snippet, here's the analysis:

The method `startConsentActivity` invokes another method `onStartConsentActivity` on the object `mService`. This invocation has a naming similarity with the API name `startConsentActivity`, and it also takes the input parameters `p1` and `p2` as arguments.

Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "this.mService.onStartConsentActivity(p1, p2);",
      "public void startConsentActivity([I p1, String p2){"
    ]
  ]
}
```

However, a more accurate representation would be to only include the invocation of `onStartConsentActivity` as it directly relates to the API's functionality:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "this.mService.onStartConsentActivity(p1, p2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This is because `startConsentActivity` itself is not a sink but rather an entry point for the API. The actual sink is the invocation of `onStartConsentActivity`, which processes the input parameters and performs the necessary action.
