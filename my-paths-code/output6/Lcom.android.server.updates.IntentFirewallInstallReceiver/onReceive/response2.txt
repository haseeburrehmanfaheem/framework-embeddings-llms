Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `onReceive` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onReceive` method has a similarity score of 1.0 with two other APIs, which indicates that they are identical in terms of code and functionality. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

The sink code for the `onReceive` method is also identical to the code in the similar APIs, which further supports the idea that they share the same functionality and access control requirements.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`, as it does not appear to interact with any sensitive data or perform any dangerous operations.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
