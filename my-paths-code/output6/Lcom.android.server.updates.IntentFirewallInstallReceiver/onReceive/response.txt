To analyze this API and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, let's break down the code:

```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```

Here are the steps and observations:
1. The method `onReceive` is invoked with parameters `Context p1` and `Intent p2`.
2. An object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor. 
   - This step involves creating a new object, which follows one of the positive rules if it has naming similarity with the API or is created with data flow from the API parameters.
3. The method `start()` is called on the newly created object `v1`.

Given these observations:
- The creation and initialization of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` involve using the input parameters (`p2` and `p1`) directly, which aligns with one of the positive rules for identifying potential sinks.
- The method invocation `v1.start()` is closely related to the object created in the previous step, indicating a data flow link between these instructions.

However, without more context about what `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its `start()` method do, or how they relate to sensitive operations, we must rely on the direct application of the rules provided. 

Based on the information given:
- The object creation directly involves API parameters (`p2` and `p1`), fitting one of the positive criteria.
- There's no clear indication that this operation returns a value used by other sinks or has naming similarity with the API name "onReceive" in a way that directly suggests it's accessing or modifying sensitive data.

Given these considerations, we can identify the creation and usage of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` as a potential sink due to its direct involvement with input parameters:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
        "v1.start();"
    ]
]
}
```

This represents the sequence of operations that together form a potential sink, with a clear data flow link between them.
