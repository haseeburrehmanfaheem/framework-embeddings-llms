Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `onDnsEvent` method.

The `onDnsEvent` method has three paths with similar code structures, and all of them interact with the same sinks:

1. `NetworkMetrics v13 = new NetworkMetrics(p1,,this.mConnectTb); this.mNetworkMetrics.put(p1, v13);`
2. `this.mLastSnapshot = v9; this.pendingSummary = v17;`

The similar APIs provided have a similarity score of 0.9296383857727051 and 0.73435378074646, respectively, with access control levels of NONE.

Analyzing the code, we can see that the `onDnsEvent` method is handling DNS events and updating network metrics. The sinks involved are related to network metrics and snapshots.

Considering the semantics of the APIs and the interactions with the sinks, it appears that the `onDnsEvent` method does not require any sensitive permissions or access control. The operations performed by the method seem to be related to network metrics and event handling, which do not pose a significant security risk.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of NONE to the `onDnsEvent` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
