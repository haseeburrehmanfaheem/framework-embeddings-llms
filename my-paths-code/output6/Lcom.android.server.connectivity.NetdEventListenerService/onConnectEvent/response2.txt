Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `onConnectEvent` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `onConnectEvent` method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them involve interactions with network metrics, capabilities, and statistics. The sink code snippets suggest that the method is responsible for collecting and processing network-related data.

The similar APIs, `onDnsEvent`, have a high similarity score (0.9296 and 0.7343) and are assigned an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with network metrics and statistics, which suggests that they are related to the `onConnectEvent` method in terms of functionality.

Considering the similarities between the `onConnectEvent` method and the `onDnsEvent` APIs, as well as the nature of the sink code snippets, I conclude that the access control level for the `onConnectEvent` method should be `NONE`. This is because the method appears to be primarily involved in collecting and processing network-related data, which does not seem to pose a significant security risk.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
