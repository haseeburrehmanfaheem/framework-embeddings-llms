To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we should consider the similarity scores and the access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the code snippet.

Given that:
- The two similar APIs have a similarity score of 1.0, which means they are identical or very closely related to the `onReceive` method in question.
- Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The code snippets provided for both similar APIs and the `onReceive` method itself involve creating an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and calling its `start()` method. This pattern suggests a consistent behavior across these methods, which is to initiate some form of asynchronous or parallel execution related to receiving intents.

Considering these points:
- The consistency in code patterns and access control levels among the similar APIs suggests that the `onReceive` method does not require special permissions (like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`) to operate.
- The similarity in functionality and lack of any indication that sensitive user data or system resources are being accessed or modified in a way that would require higher access control levels.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should have an access control level similar to its identical counterparts.

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
