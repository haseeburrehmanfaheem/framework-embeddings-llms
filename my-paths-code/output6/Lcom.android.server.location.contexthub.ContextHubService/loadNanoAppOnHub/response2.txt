Based on the provided information, I will analyze the code and determine the access control level for the `loadNanoAppOnHub` method.

The `loadNanoAppOnHub` method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them involve checking if the `mContextHubWrapper` is not null and if the `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` contains the provided hub ID (`p1`). If both conditions are true, it proceeds to create a new transaction and add it to the `mTransactionQueue`.

The sink code snippets show that the method interacts with the `mContextHubIdToInfoMap`, creates a new `ContextHubTransactionManager$1` object, and adds it to the `mTransactionQueue`. It also creates a new `ContextHubTransactionManager$TransactionRecord` object and adds it to the `mTransactionRecordDeque`.

Comparing this with the similar APIs provided:

* `queryNanoApps` has an access control level of `NONE` and interacts with the `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` and `mTransactionQueue` in a similar way.
* `unloadNanoApp` also has an access control level of `NONE` and interacts with the `mNanoAppHash` and `mTransactionQueue` in a similar way.

Given the similarities in code structure and interactions with the same data structures, I conclude that the `loadNanoAppOnHub` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
