Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `createPendingIntentClient` method. 

The method has two paths with depth 2, and both paths involve similar operations, such as checking if a context hub ID exists in a map, creating a new `ContextHubClientBroker` instance, and putting it into another map. The sink code also shows that the method is interacting with various objects, including `Integer`, `PendingIntent`, `String`, and `IContextHubClient`.

Comparing this method with the similar APIs provided, we can see that:

* The `createClient` API has a similarity score of 0.9495172500610352 and an access control level of NONE. This API also creates a new `ContextHubClientBroker` instance and returns an `IContextHubClient` object.
* The `sendMessage` API has a similarity score of 0.7721640467643738 and an access control level of NONE. Although this API has a different purpose, it also involves interacting with context hub-related objects.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all have an access control level of NONE, it is likely that the `createPendingIntentClient` method also has an access control level of NONE.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
