To determine the access control level for the `getContextHubInfo` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of `getContextHubInfo`**:
   - The method takes an integer parameter `p1`, which is used to retrieve a `ContextHubInfo` object from a map (`mContextHubIdToInfoMap`) based on this ID.
   - If the ID is not found in the map, it logs an error and returns `0` (or null, depending on how `return 0;` is interpreted in the context of returning an object).
   - The method essentially provides information about a specific Context Hub based on its handle.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **`getContextHubHandles()`**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It returns an array of handles (IDs) for all available Context Hubs. Since it only provides identifiers without any sensitive data, the access control level is minimal.
   - **`createClient()`**: Also with an access control level of `NONE`, this method creates a client for interacting with a Context Hub based on the provided ID and other parameters. It involves more complex operations but still does not seem to require elevated permissions.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - The `getContextHubInfo` method, like the similar APIs, interacts with Context Hub information but does so in a read-only manner (retrieving information based on an ID). 
   - It doesn't modify any system state or access sensitive data that would require higher permission levels.
   - Given its functionality is comparable to `getContextHubHandles()` and `createClient()`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `getContextHubInfo` should also be classified as requiring minimal access control.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the method's read-only nature and its similarity in functionality and security implications to other APIs with known access control levels.
