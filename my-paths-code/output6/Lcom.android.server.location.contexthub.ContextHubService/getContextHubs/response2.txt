To determine the access control level for the `getContextHubs` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of getContextHubs**: The method simply returns a list (`mContextHubInfoList`) without any conditional checks or modifications that could potentially introduce security risks.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code is straightforward, returning the `mContextHubInfoList` directly. This implies that there are no transformations or potential vulnerabilities introduced by the return statement itself.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getContextHubHandles() with Access Control Level: NONE**: This method returns a set of context hub handles (IDs) and has been assigned an access control level of `NONE`. The logic within this method involves creating an array from a set of IDs, which is similar in nature to returning a list (as seen in `getContextHubs`), as both involve retrieving and returning existing data without apparent modification or risk.

Given these points:

- **Nature of the Operation**: Both methods are involved in retrieving information about context hubs without any signs of modifying system settings, accessing sensitive user data, or performing operations that could be considered dangerous (e.g., executing commands, accessing external storage without permissions).

- **Access Control Comparison**: The similar API `getContextHubHandles` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it does not pose a risk to the system's security. Since `getContextHubs` performs a conceptually similar operation by returning existing information without manipulation or potential for abuse, it is reasonable to conclude that its access control requirements would be aligned with those of `getContextHubHandles`.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and considering the nature of the operations performed by both methods, it's logical to assign an access control level of `NONE` to `getContextHubs`, as it doesn't appear to pose any security risks similar to its counterpart.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
