To determine the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The given API, `resetTemporaryService`, simply calls another instance of itself (`this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);`) without any additional checks or modifications to the input parameter `p1`. This suggests that it does not directly interact with sensitive data or perform any operations that would typically require elevated permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code is essentially the same as the method's body, reinforcing the idea that this method acts as a proxy or wrapper for another call to `resetTemporaryService` on a different object (`this$0`).

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **API Name: resetTemporaryService(I)V with Similarity Score: 1.0**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. Given its high similarity score (1.0), it suggests that the behavior and implications of this method are very similar to the one in question. The fact that it also calls `this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);` without any additional logic supports the notion that these methods do not require special access controls.
   - **API Name: setTemporaryService(ILjava/lang/String;I)V with Similarity Score: 0.8328460454940796**: Although this API has a slightly lower similarity score, it still shares enough characteristics to be considered relevant for comparison. Its access control level is also `NONE`, indicating that the operations performed by these methods are likely not sensitive or dangerous.

Given the analysis above, since both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the method in question does not perform any inherently sensitive or dangerous operations (it merely delegates the call), it's reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` method should also be `NONE`.
