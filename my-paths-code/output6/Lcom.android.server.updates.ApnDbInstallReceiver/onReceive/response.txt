To identify potential sinks in the provided code snippet, we must carefully analyze each instruction for any data flow or method invocation that could indicate a sensitive operation. The given API is `onReceive`, which seems to be part of a broadcast receiver.

Given the instructions:
1. `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);`
2. `v1.start();`

Let's analyze these steps according to the rules provided:

- The creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object (`v1`) involves data flow from API parameters (`p0`, `p2`, and `p1`). This aligns with one of the positive rules regarding object creation, specifically that it is created with a data flow from the API parameters.
- The method `start()` invoked on `v1` could potentially be considered if it has naming similarity or if its invocation directly depends on the API's input parameters. However, without more context about what `start()` does, we can only consider the creation of `v1` as a potential sink based on the information given.

Therefore, the identified potential sink set is related to the creation and utilization of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, which involves direct data flow from API parameters. This aligns with one of the positive rules for object creation.

Here is the JSON representation of the identified sink:
```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
        "v1.start();"
    ]
]
}
```
This represents a coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink, with `v1` being created using API parameters and then its `start()` method being invoked. However, without more context on what `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its `start()` method do, the sensitivity and exact nature of this operation remain somewhat speculative based solely on the provided code snippet.
