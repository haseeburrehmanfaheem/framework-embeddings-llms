Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `onReceive` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onReceive` method has a similarity score of 1.0 with two other APIs, which means they are identical in terms of code structure and semantics. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

The sink code for the `onReceive` method is also identical to the code in the similar APIs:

```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```

Given this information, it's clear that the `onReceive` method performs a similar operation as the other two APIs, which have an access control level of `NONE`. Therefore, it's reasonable to assign the same access control level to the `onReceive` method.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
