Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `onReceive` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onReceive` method has a similarity score of 1.0 with two other APIs, which indicates that they are identical in terms of their code structure and functionality. All three methods create an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and call its `start()` method.

Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that this type of operation does not require any specific permissions or restrictions. The fact that multiple APIs with the same code pattern have been assigned an access control level of `NONE` implies that this is a common and acceptable practice.

Therefore, based on the similarity in code structure and the existing access control levels of similar APIs, I conclude that the `onReceive` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
