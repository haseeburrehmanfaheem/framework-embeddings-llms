To determine the access control level for the `getPendingJob` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getPendingJob` API has two paths:

1. Path 1: It retrieves a list of jobs by UID using `this.mJobSet.getJobsByUid(p1)`, checks if the list is not empty, and returns a `JobInfo` object if the job ID matches the provided UID.
2. Path 2: It also retrieves a list of jobs by UID using `this.mJobSet.getJobsByUid(p1)`, but returns `null` (0) if the list is empty.

The sink code for both paths involves accessing the `mJobSet` object and retrieving jobs by UID, which is similar to the `cancelAll()` and `getAllPendingJobs()` APIs.

Comparing with the similar APIs:

* `cancelAll()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, but its code snippet only retrieves a list of jobs by UID without returning any sensitive information.
* `getAllPendingJobs()` has an access control level of `NONE`, and its code snippet returns a list of jobs, which is more permissive than the `getPendingJob` API.

Considering the similarities and differences between the APIs, we can conclude that the `getPendingJob` API is more restrictive than `getAllPendingJobs()`, as it only returns a single `JobInfo` object or `null`. However, it still accesses sensitive information (the list of jobs by UID), which requires some level of access control.

Given these factors, the most suitable access control level for the `getPendingJob` API would be `NORMAL`, as it provides a balance between security and functionality.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
