To determine the access control level for the `getStartedJobs` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getStartedJobs` method returns a list of started jobs by iterating over an `ArraySet` named `mRunningJobs`. This suggests that it is accessing and potentially manipulating job-related data.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet shows operations related to creating an `ArrayList` from the `ArraySet` of running jobs, getting its size, and returning this list. This operation does not directly imply any dangerous or system-level modifications but rather a retrieval of existing job information.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **cancelAll()V**: This method has a similarity score of 0.775252640247345 with `getStartedJobs`. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permissions to execute, possibly because it involves canceling jobs across different UIDs (user identifiers), which can be a sensitive operation affecting multiple applications.
   - **getPendingJob(I)Landroid/app/job/JobInfo;**: With a similarity score of 0.7599784731864929, this method is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It seems to retrieve job information by UID without implying any system-level modifications or requiring special permissions.

Given these observations:

- The `getStartedJobs` method does not seem to perform any dangerous operations like modifying system settings or accessing sensitive data directly. Its primary function appears to be retrieving a list of jobs, which aligns more closely with the behavior of `getPendingJob(I)Landroid/app/job/JobInfo;`.
- Unlike `cancelAll()V`, `getStartedJobs` does not involve operations that would typically require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, such as cancelling jobs for different UIDs.
- The method's focus on retrieving job information suggests it should have a lower access control requirement compared to methods that modify system or application states.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for `getStartedJobs` would be `NORMAL`, as it involves accessing and returning job-related data without indicating the need for either no permission (`NONE`) or high-level system permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS`).
