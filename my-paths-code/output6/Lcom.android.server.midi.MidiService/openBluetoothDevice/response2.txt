After carefully reviewing the provided information, I will assign an access control level to the `openBluetoothDevice` API.

The `openBluetoothDevice` API has a similarity score of 0.801426351070404 with two other APIs: `registerListener` and `openDevice`. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

The sink code provided for `openBluetoothDevice` shows that it creates new instances of `MidiService$Client`, `MidiService$Device`, and `MidiService$DeviceConnection`, and puts them into maps using the `IBinder` and `BluetoothDevice` objects as keys. This is similar to the code in the `registerListener` and `openDevice` APIs, which also create new instances of `MidiService$Client` and put them into a map.

Given the similarity in code and functionality between these APIs, I believe that the `openBluetoothDevice` API should have the same access control level as the similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `openBluetoothDevice` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
