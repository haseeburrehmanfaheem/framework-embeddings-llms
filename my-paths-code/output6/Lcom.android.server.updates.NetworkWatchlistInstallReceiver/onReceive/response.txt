To analyze this code snippet and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, let's break down the execution flow:

1. **Method Invocation**: The `onReceive` method is invoked with parameters `Context p1` and `Intent p2`.
2. **Object Creation**: An instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` (an inner class) is created, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` as arguments to its constructor.
3. **Method Invocation on the Created Object**: The `start()` method is invoked on the newly created object `v1`.

Given these steps, we can analyze potential sinks based on the rules:

- **Method Invocation** (`onReceive` itself doesn't directly contribute to a sink but sets up the context).
- **Object Creation** (`ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);`) follows one of the positive rules because it's created with data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and `p1`). However, its relevance as a sink also depends on how `v1` is used subsequently.
- **Method Invocation** (`v1.start();`) directly influences the behavior based on the object creation. The `start()` method invocation could potentially be influenced by the input parameters (`p0`, `p2`, and `p1`), making it part of a potential sink if we consider the data flow from the API parameters to the object's methods.

However, without more context about what `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` does or how its `start()` method processes the inputs, we must focus on what is explicitly provided. The creation and use of `v1` could potentially be a sink because it involves data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and `p1`) to an object's method invocation.

Given these observations, here is how we can structure our findings in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
            "v1.start();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This represents a coherent set of instructions where the creation of `v1` directly influences its subsequent method invocation, potentially creating a data flow link from the API's input parameters to an action taken by the `start()` method. Without further information on what `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its `start()` method do, this is our best assessment based on the provided rules and code snippet.
