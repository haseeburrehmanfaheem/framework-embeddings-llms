To determine the access control level for the `supportsSensorToggle` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `supportsSensorToggle` has conditional checks based on its parameters `p1` and `p2`, but ultimately, it retrieves a boolean value from the application's resources using `getBoolean` method of the `Resources` class.
   - The sink code provided also shows retrieval of boolean values from resources, which aligns with how the method operates.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs (`getWhitelistedRuleProviders`) both have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - These methods retrieve string arrays from resources and return them as lists, which is a read-only operation regarding system or sensitive data.
   - The similarity in accessing resource values (though the type differs: boolean vs. string array) suggests that these operations are considered safe and do not pose a risk to the system's security or user's privacy.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose any security risks, such as simple data retrieval from non-sensitive sources.
   - `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, and `SYS_OR_SIG` imply increasing levels of potential risk or system impact, usually involving modifications to sensitive data, accessing protected information, or performing operations that could affect the system's integrity.

Given these points:
- The `supportsSensorToggle` method reads from application resources, which is a non-intrusive operation similar to the provided API examples.
- There's no indication of modifying system settings, accessing sensitive user data, or performing any operation that would be classified as dangerous or requiring signature or system level permissions.

**Conclusion**: Since the method's behavior aligns with reading from non-sensitive sources (application resources) without any modification capabilities or access to sensitive information, and considering the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to assign the same level of access control to the `supportsSensorToggle` method.
