Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method has three paths with depth 2, which all seem to be handling the removal of a sensor privacy listener. The method interacts with the `mListeners` and `mDeathRecipients` objects, which are also present in the similar APIs.

The similar APIs, `addSensorPrivacyListener` and `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener`, both have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with the same objects (`mListeners` and `mDeathRecipients`) and have similar code structures.

Given the similarities between the `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method and its similar APIs, it is likely that the access control level for `removeSensorPrivacyListener` should also be `NONE`. This is because the method does not appear to perform any sensitive operations or handle sensitive data that would require a higher access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
