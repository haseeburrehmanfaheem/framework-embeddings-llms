To determine the access control level for the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method, let's analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

### Code Paths Analysis

The `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method has three paths:

1. **Path 1**: Unregisters a listener from `mToggleSensorListeners`. If the listener is found in `mDeathRecipients`, it decreases the reference count (`v6 + -1`) and updates the entry in `mDeathRecipients`.
2. **Path 2**: Similar to Path 1, but if the reference count reaches zero, it removes the listener from `mDeathRecipients` and calls `destroy()` on `Pair.first`.
3. **Path 3**: Simply unregisters the listener without any further actions.

### Similar APIs Analysis

The provided similar APIs are `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener`, which have an access control level of `NONE`. Their code snippets show registration of a listener with `mToggleSensorListeners` and an increase in the reference count (`v6 + 1`) within `mDeathRecipients`.

### Access Control Decision

Given that `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` is essentially the opposite operation of `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, it's logical to infer that removing a listener would not introduce additional security risks compared to adding one. Both operations seem to manage listeners and their reference counts without exposing sensitive data or performing dangerous actions.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method should have an access control level similar to its counterpart for adding listeners, which is `NONE`. This decision reflects the understanding that removing a listener does not inherently pose security risks that would necessitate higher access control levels like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

### Final Access Control Level

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This conclusion is drawn by comparing the operational semantics of `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` with those of similar APIs (`addToggleSensorPrivacyListener`) and considering the potential security implications of listener management operations.
