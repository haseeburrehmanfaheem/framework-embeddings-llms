To analyze this code snippet according to the provided rules and guidelines:

The given method is `resetTemporaryService`, which invokes another method of the same name but on a different object (`this.this$0`). 

Here's how it aligns with the rules:
- The invoked method has naming similarity with the API name, adhering to one of the positive rules for identifying potential sinks.

However, this code snippet is relatively simple and does not involve complex data flows or the creation of new objects. It primarily involves a method invocation that directly passes on its parameter to another method call.

Given the simplicity and direct nature of this operation, we can consider the entire sequence as part of a single sink set due to the naming similarity and the direct propagation of the input parameter `p1`.

Here's how you could represent this in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This representation captures the essence of the data flow and method invocation that contributes to a potential sink, following one of the positive rules (naming similarity and direct parameter passing). Since there's only one coherent set of instructions in this snippet, it constitutes a single sink array.
