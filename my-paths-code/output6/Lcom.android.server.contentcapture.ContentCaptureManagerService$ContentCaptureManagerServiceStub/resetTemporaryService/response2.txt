To determine the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` API, we should consider the similarities with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided information includes:

1. **Similar API 1**: `resetTemporaryService(I)V` with an Access Control Level of `NONE`. This API has a similarity score of 1.0, indicating it is essentially identical in terms of functionality or structure to the method in question.
2. **Similar API 2**: `setTemporaryService(ILjava/lang/String;I)V` with an Access Control Level of `NONE`. Although its similarity score (0.8328460454940796) is not as high as the first example, it still shares a significant level of similarity and operates within a potentially related context.

Given these points:

- **Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE**, suggesting that operations related to temporary services do not require elevated permissions or strict access controls.
- The method `resetTemporaryService` directly calls another instance's method with the same name (`this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);`), indicating a straightforward operation without evidence of sensitive data handling, networking, or other dangerous activities typically requiring higher access control levels.

Based on these considerations and the fact that both provided similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `resetTemporaryService` also does not require any special permissions or strict controls. Therefore, its access control level should be aligned with those of its similar counterparts.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
