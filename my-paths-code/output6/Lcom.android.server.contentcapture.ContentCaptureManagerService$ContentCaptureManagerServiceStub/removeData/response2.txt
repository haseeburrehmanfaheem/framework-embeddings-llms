To assign an access control level to the `removeData` API, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `removeData` method involves checking if a package is owned by the calling UID and then proceeds to remove data using `RemoteContentCaptureService.scheduleAsyncRequest`.
   - It interacts with system services like `PackageManager` and checks for specific conditions before performing its main action.
   - The method uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`, indicating it cares about the caller's identity, which is a common trait in APIs that require some level of access control.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`isContentCaptureFeatureEnabled` and `getContentCaptureConditions`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - These APIs seem to be more focused on querying or retrieving information rather than performing actions that could potentially modify system state or user data directly.
   - Despite their similarity in score, the operations they perform are less intrusive compared to removing data.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - The `removeData` method can potentially impact user privacy and system security by removing captured content based on a request. This action could be sensitive depending on what kind of data is being removed.
   - Given that it checks the caller's UID and package name, there is an implicit expectation of some level of access control or permission checking.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the potential impact on system security and user privacy, along with its interaction with system services and caller identity checks, `removeData` seems to require a more cautious approach than `NONE`.
   - However, without explicit evidence of it requiring system-level permissions (like those needed for `SYS_OR_SIG`) or dangerous operations that directly manipulate sensitive data in an unauthorized manner (which would warrant `DANGEROUS`), the most fitting access control level appears to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects a balance between the need for some level of access control and the lack of clear indicators for more restrictive levels like `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS`.

Therefore, given the provided information and analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision is based on the method's functionality, its interaction with system components, and the comparison with similar APIs. It acknowledges the potential sensitivity of removing data while recognizing that the described actions do not clearly cross into the territory typically reserved for `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access levels without more explicit indicators of such risk.
