To assign an access control level to the `finishSession` API, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The `finishSession` method takes an integer parameter `p1`, which is used to retrieve a session from the `mSessions` map. If the session exists and Content Capture Per User Service is enabled, it destroys the session.

Looking at the sink code, we can see that the `Integer.valueOf(p1)` line creates an integer object from the input parameter `p1`. The `this.mSessions.get(p1)` line retrieves a session from the `mSessions` map based on the input parameter `p1`.

Now, let's analyze the similar APIs:

- The `setHasCallback(IIZ)V` API has a similarity score of 0.9073081016540527 and an access control level of NONE. This API also interacts with the `mSessions` map, but its access control level is NONE.

- The `closeSession(Landroid/os/IBinder;)V` API has a similarity score of 0.8279487490653992 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This API removes a session from the `mSessions` map, which is similar to the `finishSession` method's behavior when it destroys a session.

Considering these factors, we can see that the `finishSession` method interacts with system resources (the `mSessions` map) and performs an action that could potentially affect the system's state (destroying a session). However, its access control level is not as sensitive as the `closeSession` API, which requires SYS_OR_SIG access.

Therefore, based on the similarity scores and the code analysis, we can assign an access control level of NORMAL to the `finishSession` API. This is because it interacts with system resources, but its actions are not as critical or sensitive as those requiring SYS_OR_SIG access.

Here's the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
