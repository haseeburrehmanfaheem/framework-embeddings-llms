To assign an access control level to the `suppressAmbientDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `suppressAmbientDisplay` method checks if `this.mBar` is equal to 0, and if so, it calls the `suppressAmbientDisplay` method on `this.mBar`, passing the parameter `p1`. This suggests that the method interacts with a bar object (likely related to the system UI or notification bar) and influences its behavior regarding ambient display.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet provided shows a similar check and call pattern, reinforcing the interaction with `this.mBar` for suppressing ambient display.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **handleSystemKey(I)V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.8040808439254761) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code pattern is similar, interacting with `this.mBar` for handling system keys.
   - **removeIcon(Ljava/lang/String;)V**: With a similarity score of 0.754526674747467, this API also interacts with `this.mBar`, but for removing icons, and it's assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the similarities in code patterns, interaction with system-level components (`this.mBar`), and the assigned access control levels of similar APIs, it suggests that the `suppressAmbientDisplay` method also operates at a system or signature level, influencing system UI behavior.

Therefore, considering the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `suppressAmbientDisplay` API should be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the patterns and access levels of similar APIs that interact with system-level components.
