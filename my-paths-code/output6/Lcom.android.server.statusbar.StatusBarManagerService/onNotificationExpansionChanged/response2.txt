To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method, we should consider the similarities with other provided APIs that have known access control levels. Both similar APIs, `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` and `onNotificationBubbleChanged`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The key factors to consider include:

1. **Similarity in Method Signature**: All three methods (`onNotificationExpansionChanged`, `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`, and `onNotificationBubbleChanged`) interact with a delegate object (`this.mNotificationDelegate`), suggesting they are part of a similar design pattern or functionality within the system, likely related to notification management.

2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` and `onNotificationBubbleChanged` have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to notification visibility and bubble changes are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions to execute, implying they could potentially impact the user's experience, privacy, or security.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code for `onNotificationExpansionChanged` is `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationExpansionChanged(p1, p2, p3, p4);`, which directly calls a method on the notification delegate with parameters that could influence how notifications are displayed or behave. This kind of functionality can be sensitive as it deals with user interface elements and potentially private information (notifications).

Given these considerations:

- The method is similar to others that have been classified as requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.
- It interacts with system-level components (notification delegate) in a way that could affect the user experience or privacy.
- There's no clear indication that this method would be less sensitive than its similar counterparts.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that `onNotificationExpansionChanged` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it likely requires system or signature-level permissions to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.
