After analyzing the provided code paths for the API `cancelRequestAddTile`, I have identified potential sinks. Here is the information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "Object v5 = this.mCurrentRequestAddTilePackages.remove(p1);",
            "this.mBar.cancelRequestAddTile(p1);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Here's my reasoning for identifying these sinks:

* The `remove` method invocation on `mCurrentRequestAddTilePackages` with the input parameter `p1` is a potential sink because it has high naming similarity with the API name `cancelRequestAddTile` and processes the input parameter.
* The `cancelRequestAddTile` method invocation on `this.mBar` with the input parameter `p1` is also a potential sink for similar reasons: it has naming similarity with the API name and processes the same input parameter. 

Both of these instructions are directly related to the API's purpose, which is to cancel a request add tile operation. They both contribute to the overall functionality of the API and can be considered as part of the same sink set due to their coherent data flow link.

The `if (v5 == 0)` statement and the conditional checks for `this.mBar` are auxiliary operations that lead to the invocation of the potential sinks, but they themselves do not directly contribute to a sensitive operation or data flow. Therefore, they are not included in the sink set.

Note that there is only one identified sink set because both instructions (`remove` method and `cancelRequestAddTile` method) are related to each other through their connection with the input parameter `p1` and their purpose within the API's functionality.
