To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationDirectReplied` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet**: The method calls `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` around the call to `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationDirectReplied(p1)`. This suggests that the method is careful about handling the caller's identity, which is a common practice when dealing with potentially sensitive operations or when interacting with system-level components.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code is `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationDirectReplied(p1);`, indicating that the method delegates its functionality to another component (`mNotificationDelegate`), which is responsible for handling notifications.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **onNotificationFeedbackReceived**: This API has a similarity score of 0.8068280816078186 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows a similar pattern of delegating to `mNotificationDelegate`.
   - **onNotificationVisibilityChanged**: With a similarity score of 0.8028278946876526, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and delegates its functionality to `mNotificationDelegate`.

Given these points:

- The method interacts with system-level notification handling by delegating tasks to `mNotificationDelegate`, similar to the other APIs provided.
- The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` suggests an awareness of security and identity management, which is often associated with system or signature-level access controls.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system-level permissions or signature-level access (i.e., the app must be signed with the same certificate as the platform or a special permission granted to system apps).

Based on this analysis, the `onNotificationDirectReplied` method is likely to require similar access control due to its interaction with system notification handling and the need to manage caller identity securely.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
