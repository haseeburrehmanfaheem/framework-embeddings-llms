Here is the JSON output for the sinks in the provided API:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "long v3 = Binder.clearCallingIdentity();",
        "this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);",
        "Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3);"
    ]
]
}
```

However, according to the rules you've specified for identifying sinks:

*   `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` are auxiliary operations.
*   The method invocation `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);` has input parameters as arguments but does not return any value or have naming similarity with the API name. Since it's a method call that processes the input parameters `p1` and `p2`, we can consider this as part of a sink.

Since there are no other operations in the code snippet that match the rules for identifying sinks, we should be cautious about labeling the entire sequence as a sink. But considering the data flow from `p1` and `p2` into the method call, it's reasonable to include it as a potential sink:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);"
    ]
]
}
```
