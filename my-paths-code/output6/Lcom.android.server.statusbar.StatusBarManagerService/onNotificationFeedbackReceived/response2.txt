To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` calls `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and then invokes `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);` before restoring the calling identity with `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3);`. This pattern suggests that the method is interacting with a system-level component or service (`mNotificationDelegate`) while ensuring that the calling identity is temporarily cleared to perform the operation without revealing or using the caller's identity. This is typically done for security reasons, to prevent leaks of sensitive information about the caller.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` has a high similarity score (0.8190553188323975) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows interaction with `this.mNotificationDelegate`, similar to `onNotificationFeedbackReceived`.
   - The API `onNotificationDirectReplied` also has a high similarity score (0.8068280816078186) and the same access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`). It interacts with `this.mNotificationDelegate` as well.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to be invoked, which suggests that these methods are handling sensitive operations related to notifications.
- The code pattern in `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` involving `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and interaction with a notification delegate implies a need for secure handling of notification feedback, likely requiring system-level access control to ensure the operation is performed securely without leaking caller identity.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` should have an access control level similar to its highly similar counterparts, given their shared patterns and the security implications of interacting with system-level components like notification delegates.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
