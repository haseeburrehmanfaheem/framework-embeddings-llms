To assign an access control level to the `remTile` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `remTile` method takes a `ComponentName` object as input and removes a tile from the Quick Settings panel if `this.mBar` is 0. The sink code `this.mBar.remQsTile(p1);` is responsible for removing the tile.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `addTile(Landroid/content/ComponentName;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that adding a tile to the Quick Settings panel requires system or signature-level permission. The code snippet is similar, where it adds a tile if `this.mBar` is 0.
* `clickTile(Landroid/content/ComponentName;)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that clicking on a tile in the Quick Settings panel requires system or signature-level permission. Again, the code snippet is similar, where it clicks on a tile if `this.mBar` is 0.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all interact with the Quick Settings panel, it's reasonable to conclude that removing a tile from the Quick Settings panel should also require system or signature-level permission. Therefore, the access control level for the `remTile` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
