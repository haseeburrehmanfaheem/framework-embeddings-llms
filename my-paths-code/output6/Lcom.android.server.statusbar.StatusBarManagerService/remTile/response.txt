Based on the provided code, here's the analysis of potential sinks:

The method `remTile` is invoked with input parameter `p1`. The instruction that contributes to a sink is:

* `this.mBar.remQsTile(p1);`

This line has naming similarity with the API name (`rem` prefix in both `remTile` and `remQsTile`) and also processes the input parameter `p1`.

However, since there are no field get/set cases, object creation, or return values that follow the positive rules, this single instruction is the only contributor to a potential sink.

Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "this.mBar.remQsTile(p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Note that there's only one array in 'Sinks' because there's no direct data propagation between multiple instructions. The single instruction `this.mBar.remQsTile(p1);` meets the positive rule of having naming similarity with the API name and processing the input parameter, making it a potential sink.
