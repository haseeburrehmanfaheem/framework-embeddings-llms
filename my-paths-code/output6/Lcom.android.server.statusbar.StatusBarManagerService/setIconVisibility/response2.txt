To determine the access control level for the `setIconVisibility` method, we should consider its functionality, the similar APIs provided, and their assigned access control levels. 

The `setIconVisibility` method appears to interact with system-level UI components (specifically, status bar icons) by either making them visible or invisible based on the boolean parameter `p2`. This interaction involves checking the current visibility state of an icon (`StatusBarIcon.visible == p2`) and then updating it if necessary. The method also checks for the existence of an icon in a collection (`this.mIcons.get(p1)`) before attempting to modify its visibility.

Given the similar APIs:
- `removeIcon(Ljava/lang/String;)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that removing icons from the status bar is considered a system or signature-level operation. This implies that operations directly affecting system UI components are restricted to either system apps or those signed with the platform key.

Considering these points:
- The `setIconVisibility` method directly affects system UI by changing the visibility of status bar icons.
- Similar APIs (`removeIcon`) that also interact with system UI elements are classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require a higher level of access control due to their potential impact on system integrity and user experience.

Therefore, given the functional similarity and the implications of modifying system UI components, it's reasonable to conclude that the `setIconVisibility` method should have an access control level similar to those of the provided examples, which are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
