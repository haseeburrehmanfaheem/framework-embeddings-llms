To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationSmartReplySent` method, we should analyze its similarities with other provided APIs, specifically focusing on their interactions with sinks (in this case, `this.mNotificationDelegate`) and their assigned access control levels.

Given that both similar APIs (`onNotificationSmartSuggestionsAdded` and `onNotificationFeedbackReceived`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we need to consider why they are assigned this level. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that the API is either system-internal or signature-protected, meaning it's only accessible to applications signed with the same certificate as the system or to system components.

Looking at the provided code snippet for `onNotificationSmartReplySent`, we see that it:

1. Clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`.
2. Calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationSmartReplySent(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5);`, which suggests interaction with a system-level component (`mNotificationDelegate`).
3. Restores the calling identity using `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`.

The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` typically indicates that the method is performing operations that should be executed without imposing the caller's identity restrictions, which is common for system-internal operations or when interacting with other system components. This pattern is consistent with the need to protect such methods from being called by arbitrary applications, thus requiring either system-level privileges or a specific signature.

Given these observations and the similarities in access control levels of the provided APIs (`onNotificationSmartSuggestionsAdded` and `onNotificationFeedbackReceived`), it's reasonable to conclude that `onNotificationSmartReplySent` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized system components or applications with the appropriate signature can invoke this method, aligning with the security practices indicated by its similar APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis and comparison with other APIs:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
