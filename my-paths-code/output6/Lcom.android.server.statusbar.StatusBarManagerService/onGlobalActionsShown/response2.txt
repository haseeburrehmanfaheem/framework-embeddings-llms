To determine the access control level for the `onGlobalActionsShown` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onGlobalActionsShown` method clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` before performing its main action (notifying a listener if one is set) and then restores it with `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`. This pattern suggests that the method is taking steps to ensure that actions performed within its scope do not inadvertently expose or modify sensitive data based on the caller's identity, which is a common practice when interacting with system-level components.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **onPanelHidden()V**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7951174378395081 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code snippet also uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`, similar to the method in question, indicating system-level interactions that require careful handling of caller identities.
   - **requestColorMode(II)V**: With a similarity score of 0.7678706049919128 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, this API also employs `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`, further reinforcing the pattern that such system-level interactions are protected.

Given these observations:

- The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` in all mentioned APIs (including the one in question) indicates a need to protect against potential misuse by ensuring actions are performed without revealing or being influenced by the caller's identity. This is typically necessary for system-level operations.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, suggesting that they operate within a context requiring either system or signature-level permissions.

Based on this analysis and considering the protective measures taken in the code snippet (use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`), it's reasonable to conclude that the `onGlobalActionsShown` method also operates at a level requiring protection similar to its counterparts, especially since it interacts with system-level components or listeners.

Therefore, the access control level for the `onGlobalActionsShown` API should be **SYS_OR_SIG**, aligning with the levels assigned to its similar APIs and reflecting the need for controlled access to system-level functionalities.
