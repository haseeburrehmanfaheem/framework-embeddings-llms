To determine the access control level for the `requestTileServiceListeningState` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method involves checking the calling UID, package name, and interacting with a `ChangeIdStateQuery` object. It also checks various conditions related to `PropertyInvalidatedCache` and eventually calls `this.mBar.requestTileServiceListeningState(p1)` under certain conditions. This suggests that the method is involved in managing or requesting state changes for tile services, which could potentially interact with sensitive system components or user data.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code points involve creating a `ChangeIdStateQuery` object and checking if it can bypass certain cache checks. The second part of the sink code directly calls another instance's `requestTileServiceListeningState` method, indicating a possible delegation or forwarding of the request. These operations might require specific permissions to ensure that only authorized components can request such state changes.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **togglePanel()V**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting it requires either system or signature-level permission. Its similarity score with `requestTileServiceListeningState` is 0.8617727160453796, indicating a high degree of similarity in their functionalities or implementations.
   - **clickTile(Landroid/content/ComponentName;)V**: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, with a similarity score of 0.7325623631477356. This method interacts with tile services as well, further indicating that operations related to tile services might require elevated permissions.

Given these points:

- The high similarity scores and the nature of operations (interacting with system components, checking UIDs, package names, and potentially sensitive cache data) suggest that `requestTileServiceListeningState` should have an access control level that restricts its usage to authorized components.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies that they can only be called by system processes or processes signed with the same certificate as the system, indicating a need for high-level permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and considering the similarities with other APIs that interact with tile services and require system or signature-level permissions, it's reasonable to conclude that `requestTileServiceListeningState` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
