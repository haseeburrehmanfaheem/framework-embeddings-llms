To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics and sink interactions of these methods.

1. **Similarity Scores and Access Control Levels**:
   - The `onNotificationBubbleChanged` API has a similarity score of 0.8622195720672607 with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
   - The `onNotificationSettingsViewed` API has a similarity score of 0.8364088535308838, also with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

2. **Semantics and Sink Interactions**:
   - All methods interact with `this.mNotificationDelegate`, suggesting they are part of a notification handling system.
   - The interaction with `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` in the `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` method indicates that it is managing or protecting its operations from affecting or being affected by the caller's identity, which is a characteristic often associated with system-level or signature-protected operations to prevent misuse.

Given these points:
- The high similarity scores indicate that these methods are closely related in terms of functionality and possibly security requirements.
- The access control levels of SYS_OR_SIG for similar APIs suggest that these notifications-related operations require either system-level access or a specific signature to be executed, likely due to the sensitive nature of notification handling and its potential impact on user privacy and system integrity.

Therefore, considering the method's interaction with potentially sensitive system components (like `this.mNotificationDelegate`) and the pattern observed in similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` method should also have an access control level that reflects the need for either system-level privileges or specific signature permissions to execute.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
