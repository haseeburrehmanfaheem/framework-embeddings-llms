To determine the access control level for the `onSessionEnded` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onSessionEnded` method takes two parameters, an integer `p1` and an `InstanceId p2`. It checks if the integer value `p1` is contained within `StatusBarManager.ALL_SESSIONS`. If it is, the method proceeds to log an error message if the session type is invalid or iterates over a list of listeners associated with the session type. This suggests that the method is involved in managing sessions and notifying listeners about session endings.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code provided is empty, which implies there might not be a direct sensitive data leak or critical operation being performed by this method that directly interacts with known security-sensitive sinks like file I/O, network operations, or direct hardware access.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `setVrThread(I)V` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method seems unrelated to session management or security-sensitive operations based on its name and the given similarity score.
   - `setFrontActivityScreenCompatMode(I)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests it might be involved in system-level operations or requires signature-level permissions, possibly affecting how activities are displayed or managed at a system level.

Given these points:
- The `onSessionEnded` method does not seem to directly interact with security-sensitive data or operations based on the provided paths and sink information.
- Its primary function appears to be related to session management and logging, which does not inherently require dangerous permissions or signature-level access.
- However, considering it's part of a system that manages sessions (potentially system-wide or across applications), there might be an argument for it requiring some level of permission or access control.

Since the method seems to be more about internal session management and logging rather than direct interaction with sensitive data or hardware, and given the lack of clear indication that it requires system or signature-level permissions based on its functionality, a conservative approach would place its access control level at `NONE`. This is because it doesn't directly engage in dangerous operations like file I/O, network access, or other security-sensitive activities as typically defined by Android's permission model.

**Access Control Level Decision**: Given the information and analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `onSessionEnded` method would be `NONE`, as it does not appear to perform operations that require elevated permissions or direct access to sensitive resources.
