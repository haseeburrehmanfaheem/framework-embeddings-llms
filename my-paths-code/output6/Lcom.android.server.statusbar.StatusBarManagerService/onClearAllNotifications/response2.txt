To assign an access control level to the `onClearAllNotifications` method, we must consider its functionality, the sink it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `onClearAllNotifications` method:
- Takes an integer parameter `p1`.
- Retrieves the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`, respectively.
- Clears the calling identity with `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` to perform an operation as if it were being done by the system itself, not the caller.
- Calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onClearAll(v3, v4, p1)`; this is where it interacts with a sink related to notification management.
- Restores the calling identity afterward.

Similar APIs provided are:
1. `onNotificationClear` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to be invoked. This is because they interact with sensitive features related to notifications, which are protected by the system to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.

The `onClearAllNotifications` method interacts with a similar sink (`this.mNotificationDelegate.onClearAll(v3, v4, p1)`) and deals with clearing all notifications, an action that likely requires protection against unauthorized invocation. Given its functionality is closely related to managing notifications (a sensitive feature), it's reasonable to infer that it should have a similar access control level as the provided APIs.

Therefore, considering the method's interaction with sensitive system features and comparing it with similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `onClearAllNotifications` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, reflecting the need for either system or signature-level permissions to perform such an action.
