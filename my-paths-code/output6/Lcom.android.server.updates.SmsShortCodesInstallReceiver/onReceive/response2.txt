To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `onReceive` method's code snippet is as follows:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
And the sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Both of these snippets indicate that the `onReceive` method initializes an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` with parameters and then starts it. This operation does not directly access or manipulate sensitive user data, device hardware, or other resources that would typically require elevated permissions.

The similar APIs provided have a similarity score of 1.0 and are assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Their code snippets are identical to the sink code of the method in question, which further supports the notion that this method does not perform operations requiring higher access control levels.

Given these observations:

- The method's operation does not directly interact with sensitive data or require special permissions.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and perform essentially the same operations.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons, the most appropriate access control level for the `onReceive` method is `NONE`, as it aligns with the behavior and security implications of the similar APIs and does not indicate a need for elevated permissions.

The final answer is:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
