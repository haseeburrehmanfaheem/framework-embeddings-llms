To determine the access control level for the `stopScan` method, we should consider the similarities with other APIs, particularly those that interact with the same sinks or have similar semantics.

1. **Similarity with `startScan(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)V`:**
   - This API has a high similarity score (0.9574139714241028), indicating that it shares significant code structure and possibly functionality with `stopScan`.
   - The access control level for `startScan` is `NONE`, suggesting that this operation does not pose significant security risks or require special permissions to execute.
   - Both methods interact with the same sink (`this.mAllManagerRecords.get(v5)`), which further suggests they might have similar access control requirements.

2. **Similarity with `stopWifiDisplayScan()V`:**
   - Although this API has a lower similarity score (0.7732478976249695) compared to `startScan`, it is still worth considering due to its relevance in terms of stopping a scan operation.
   - The access control level for `stopWifiDisplayScan` is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that this operation either requires system-level permissions or a signature-level permission, possibly due to the sensitive nature of controlling WiFi display scans.

Given these considerations:

- **`stopScan`** seems more closely related to **`startScan`** in terms of functionality and code structure. Both are methods that control scanning operations through `IMediaRouter2Manager`, suggesting they operate within a similar security context.
- The interaction with the sink (`v6.stopScan()`) is directly comparable to `v6.startScan()` in `startScan`, reinforcing the idea that their access control levels should be aligned.

Therefore, considering the higher similarity score and functional equivalence with `startScan`, it's reasonable to conclude that `stopScan` does not require elevated permissions or special signatures to execute, aligning with an access control level of **`NONE`**.
