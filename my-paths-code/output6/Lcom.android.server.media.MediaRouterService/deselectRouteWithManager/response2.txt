To assign an access control level to the `deselectRouteWithManager` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **API Code**: The method has two paths with depth 2, both involving null checks and interactions with a handler (`MediaRouter2ServiceImpl$UserRecord.mHandler`) to send messages.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink involves creating a message using `PooledLambda.obtainMessage` and sending it via the handler, which is similar to the patterns observed in the provided similar APIs.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `deselectRouteWithRouter2`: This API has a high similarity score (0.9449113011360168) with `deselectRouteWithManager`. It interacts with a handler and sends a message, and its access control level is `NONE`.
   - `unregisterRouter2`: Although it has a slightly lower similarity score (0.9295246601104736), this API also involves sending a message through a handler, similar to the pattern in `deselectRouteWithManager`, and its access control level is `NONE`.

Given these observations:

- All APIs (`deselectRouteWithManager` and its similar APIs) primarily deal with messaging through handlers without explicit dangerous operations (like direct file access, network communication, or sensitive data handling that would typically require higher access control levels).
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not perform actions that are considered dangerous or requiring special permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the provided code and the similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `deselectRouteWithManager` does not require a high level of access control. Therefore, its access control level should be consistent with the similar APIs provided.
