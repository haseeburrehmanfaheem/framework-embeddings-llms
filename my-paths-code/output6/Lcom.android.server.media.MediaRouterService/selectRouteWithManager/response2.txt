Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `selectRouteWithManager` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `selectRouteWithManager` method interacts with the `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl$UserRecord.mHandler` sink, which is also present in the similar APIs `releaseSessionWithManager` and `transferToRouteWithManager`. These similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

The code snippet of `selectRouteWithManager` shows that it performs a null check on the `manager` parameter and then interacts with the `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl$UserRecord.mHandler` sink. The sink code is similar to the one present in the similar APIs.

Considering the similarity in code and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `selectRouteWithManager` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
