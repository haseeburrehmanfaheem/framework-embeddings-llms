To determine the access control level for the `getSystemSessionInfo` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves creating a new instance of `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3`, obtaining a message using `PooledLambda.obtainMessage`, and sending this message via `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl$UserRecord.mHandler.sendMessage`. It also constructs a `RoutingSessionInfo` object based on certain conditions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sinks involve the creation of lambda instances, obtaining messages, and constructing `RoutingSessionInfo` objects, which are similar to operations found in other APIs with known access control levels.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `deselectRouteWithRouter2`: Has an access control level of `NONE`. It involves sending a message through a handler after creating a lambda instance, similar to the operations within `getSystemSessionInfo`.
   - `unregisterRouter2`: Also has an access control level of `NONE`. It too creates a lambda instance and sends a message via a handler.

Given these points:

- The operations in `getSystemSessionInfo` (creating lambda instances, sending messages through handlers, constructing specific objects) are similar to those in the provided APIs (`deselectRouteWithRouter2` and `unregisterRouter2`) that have an access control level of `NONE`.
- There's no explicit indication of sensitive data being accessed or modified directly by `getSystemSessionInfo`, which would typically warrant a higher access control level like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The method seems to primarily deal with routing and session information management, which based on the similarity scores and provided examples, does not require elevated permissions.

Therefore, considering the similarities in operation and the absence of clear sensitive data handling or system-critical functionality that would necessitate higher access control, the most appropriate access control level for `getSystemSessionInfo` is `NONE`.
