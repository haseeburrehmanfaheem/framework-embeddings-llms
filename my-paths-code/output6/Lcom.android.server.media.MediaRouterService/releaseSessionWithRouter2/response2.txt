To determine the access control level for the `releaseSessionWithRouter2` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `releaseSessionWithRouter2` method has two paths:

1. The first path checks if the `p2` parameter is empty. If it is, the method clears the calling identity, retrieves an `IBinder` object from the `IMediaRouter2` interface, and checks if a record exists in the `mAllRouterRecords` map. If a record exists, the method restores the calling identity and returns.
2. The second path is similar to the first path but also creates a new message using `PooledLambda.obtainMessage` and sends it to a handler.

The sink code provided shows that the method interacts with the `IBinder` object and the `mAllRouterRecords` map, which are also present in the similar APIs.

Now, let's analyze the similar APIs:

* The `setRouteVolumeWithRouter2` API has an access control level of `NONE`. Its code snippet is similar to the second path of the `releaseSessionWithRouter2` method, as it also creates a new message using `PooledLambda.obtainMessage` and sends it to a handler.
* The `selectRouteWithRouter2` API also has an access control level of `NONE`. Its code snippet is similar to the first path of the `releaseSessionWithRouter2` method, as it retrieves an `IBinder` object from the `IMediaRouter2` interface and checks if a record exists in the `mAllRouterRecords` map.

Given the similarities between the `releaseSessionWithRouter2` method and the provided APIs, we can conclude that the access control level for the `releaseSessionWithRouter2` method should also be `NONE`.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
