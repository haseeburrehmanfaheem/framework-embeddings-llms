To determine the access control level for the `reportChangeByUid` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided. The given method has a simple implementation:

```java
public void reportChangeByUid(long p1, int p2){
    this.mChangeReporter.reportChange(p2, p1, 3);
    return;
}
```

And it interacts with the sink:
```java
['this.mChangeReporter.reportChange(p2, p1, 3);']
```

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. Let's examine their code to understand why they were assigned this level and compare them with `reportChangeByUid`.

1. The first similar API (`reportChange(JLandroid/content/pm/ApplicationInfo;)V` with a similarity score of 0.9968584775924683) has the following key operations:
   - Checks if it should write to stats log.
   - Writes to FrameworkStatsLog.
   - Creates a `ChangeReport` object and marks it as reported.

2. The second similar API (`reportChange(JLandroid/content/pm/ApplicationInfo;)V` with a similarity score of 0.9876207113265991) performs essentially the same operations, with an additional debug log statement.

Both of these APIs are assigned an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that they do not pose significant security risks or require elevated permissions to execute their primary functions.

Now, comparing these with `reportChangeByUid`:

- The method directly calls `this.mChangeReporter.reportChange(p2, p1, 3);`, which is a simplified version of the operations performed by the similar APIs. It doesn't explicitly check for stats log writing permission or perform any operation that would typically require elevated access control (like direct file I/O, network communication, etc.).

Given this analysis and considering the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned `NONE` as their access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that `reportChangeByUid` also does not require significant security permissions or pose a substantial risk. Thus, its access control level should be aligned with those of the similar APIs.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
