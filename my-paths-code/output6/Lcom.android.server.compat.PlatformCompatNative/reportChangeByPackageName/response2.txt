To determine the access control level for the `reportChangeByPackageName` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method interacts with `PackageManagerInternal` to get an `ApplicationInfo` object based on a package name and other parameters.
   - It checks if the application info is null and reports a change using `this.mChangeReporter.reportChange` if it is.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `isChangeEnabledByPackageName`: This method has a similarity score of 0.804976224899292 with `reportChangeByPackageName`. Its access control level is NONE, indicating that it does not pose significant security risks or require special permissions to execute.
   - `reportChangeByUid`: With a similarity score of 0.7848610281944275, this method also has an access control level of NONE. It reports changes based on UID and interacts with stats logging mechanisms.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippet shows interaction with `PackageManagerInternal` and reporting changes through `this.mChangeReporter.reportChange`. This suggests internal operations related to application state changes.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs (`isChangeEnabledByPackageName` and `reportChangeByUid`) have an access control level of NONE, it implies that they do not require special permissions or pose significant security risks.
   - The `reportChangeByPackageName` method's operations, such as reporting changes based on package names and interacting with internal services, seem to align with the behaviors of the similar APIs.

Based on this analysis, since the method does not appear to directly access sensitive user data, perform critical system modifications, or require special permissions beyond what's typically available within its context, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects minimal risk and no requirement for elevated permissions.

**Final Access Control Level**:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This conclusion is drawn from the similarity in functionality with other APIs labeled as NONE, the nature of its operations, and the absence of clear indicators suggesting a need for higher access control levels like NORMAL, DANGEROUS, or SYS_OR_SIG.
