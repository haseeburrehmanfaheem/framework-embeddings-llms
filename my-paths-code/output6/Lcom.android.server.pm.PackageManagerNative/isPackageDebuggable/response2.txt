To determine the access control level for the `isPackageDebuggable` API, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the API**: The `isPackageDebuggable` method checks if a package is debuggable. It involves getting the calling user ID and interacting with package management internals, such as snapshots and application info.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets involve getting the calling user ID and retrieving application information for a given package. This suggests interactions with system-level data but does not directly imply dangerous operations like data leakage or privilege escalation without proper context.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`hasSha256SigningCertificate`) have an access control level of `NONE`. 
   - These APIs are involved in checking the signing certificates of packages, which is a security-related operation but seems to be considered as not requiring additional access control beyond what's normally applied to package management queries.
   - The similarity scores are high (0.9557085633277893 and 0.9455924034118652), indicating that the `isPackageDebuggable` API shares significant functionality or structure with these APIs.

4. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that operations related to querying package properties (like being debuggable or having specific certificates) are considered standard package management tasks.
   - The interactions with system components and data in `isPackageDebuggable` do not explicitly indicate a need for elevated permissions or dangerous operations beyond typical package management.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `isPackageDebuggable` API would be `NONE`, as it aligns with the treatment of similar APIs involved in package management queries and does not inherently suggest dangerous or sensitive operations requiring higher access control levels.
