Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `getNamesForUids` method.

The `getNamesForUids` method has a similarity score of 0.9258 with the `isPackageDebuggable` method and a similarity score of 0.9094 with the `hasSha256SigningCertificate` method, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the `getNamesForUids` method is likely to have a similar access control level.

Upon reviewing the code snippets of the `getNamesForUids` method and its similar APIs, we can observe that they all interact with the `PackageManagerService$Snapshot` and `ComputerEngine` classes, which are related to package management and snapshot statistics. The methods also use similar patterns of locking, snapshot rebuilding, and computer engine usage.
