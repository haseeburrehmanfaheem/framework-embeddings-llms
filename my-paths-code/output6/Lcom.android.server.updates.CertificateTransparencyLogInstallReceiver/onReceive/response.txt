To analyze this API and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, let's break down the code step by step.

The API in question is `onReceive`, which takes two parameters: `Context p1` and `Intent p2`. The method creates a new instance of an inner class `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor, then starts it.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Method Invocation**: The creation and start of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` can be considered a method invocation since it involves creating an object of an inner class and calling its `start()` method. This follows one of the positive rules because the new object is created with data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and `p1`).

2. **Field Access**: There isn't explicit field access in this snippet that directly relates to the API name or returns a value used by other sink cases.

3. **Object Creation**: The creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is a key point here. It has a naming similarity with the API (`ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver`) and is created with data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and `p1`). This follows one of the positive rules for object creation.

Given this analysis, we can identify that there's a potential sink related to the creation and execution of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, which directly uses the input parameters of the `onReceive` method. 

Here is the JSON representation of the identified sink:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v1.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This sink set represents a coherent sequence of instructions where the creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its subsequent execution are directly linked, with the output/input being the parameters passed to its constructor.
