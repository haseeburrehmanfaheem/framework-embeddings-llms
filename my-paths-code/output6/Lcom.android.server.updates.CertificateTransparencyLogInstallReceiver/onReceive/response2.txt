To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we should analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The given `onReceive` method creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing in parameters `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`, and then starts this instance. The sink code is directly related to creating and starting this new instance, which suggests that the method's primary action is initiating some form of asynchronous or parallel execution related to receiving an intent.

Both similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. Their code snippets are nearly identical to the one in the `onReceive` method under analysis. This similarity indicates that these methods perform a standard operation without requiring special permissions or posing significant risks (such as accessing sensitive data, performing dangerous operations, or needing system-level privileges).

Given this information:

- The behavior of starting an asynchronous task upon receiving an intent does not inherently require elevated permissions.
- The similar APIs with the same access control level (`NONE`) suggest a pattern where such operations are considered standard and do not pose significant security risks.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippets and the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.
