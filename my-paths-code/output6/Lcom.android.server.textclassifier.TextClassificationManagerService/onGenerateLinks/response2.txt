Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `onGenerateLinks` method.

The method has two paths with similar code and interacts with the same sinks as the similar APIs. The sinks are related to text classification and user state management.

The similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

Considering the similarity in code and functionality between the `onGenerateLinks` method and the similar APIs, it is likely that the `onGenerateLinks` method also requires system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `onGenerateLinks` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
