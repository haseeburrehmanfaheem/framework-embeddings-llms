After carefully reviewing the provided information, I will assign an access control level to the `getApexInfo` API.

The `getApexInfo` API appears to be related to retrieving information about APEX (Android Package EXtension) packages. It interacts with the `PackageManager` to get installed packages and performs some filtering operations.

Comparing this API with the similar APIs provided:

1. `setVrThread(I)V` has an access control level of `NONE`, but its functionality seems unrelated to package management or information retrieval.
2. `setFrontActivityScreenCompatMode(I)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests it requires a system or signature-level permission. However, this API's functionality is also unrelated to package management.

Given the `getApexInfo` API's purpose and the lack of direct similarity with the provided APIs, I will focus on the semantics of the API itself. The API retrieves information about APEX packages, which might be considered sensitive information. However, it does not appear to modify any system settings or perform actions that would typically require elevated permissions.

Based on this analysis, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getApexInfo` API, as it seems to be retrieving information that is not extremely sensitive and does not require system-level permissions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
