To analyze this code snippet for potential sinks, we will follow the provided positive and negative rules.

The given API is `onReceive`, which takes a `Context` and an `Intent` as parameters. Let's break down the instructions:

1. `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);`
   - This line creates a new object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. 
   - The creation of this object has naming similarity with the API name (considering `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver` as part of the broader class or context), and it is created using data flow from the API parameters (`p2`, `p1`).

2. `v1.start();`
   - This line invokes a method named `start()` on the newly created object `v1`.
   - The invocation of this method directly follows the creation of `v1`, which was influenced by the API's input parameters.

3. `return;`
   - This is simply a return statement indicating the end of the method and does not contribute to any data flow or sink identification based on the provided rules.

Given these observations, we can identify one potential set of sinks in this code snippet:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
        "v1.start();"
    ]
]
}
```

This identified sink follows the positive rule for object creation with data flow from API parameters and method invocation directly related to that created object. The `return` statement does not contribute to any potential sink based on the provided rules, as it does not involve data manipulation or propagation relevant to access control analysis.
