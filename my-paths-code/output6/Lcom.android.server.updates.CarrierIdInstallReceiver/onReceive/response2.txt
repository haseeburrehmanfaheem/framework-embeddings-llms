To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the sink code it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided `onReceive` method has the following characteristics:
- It takes a `Context` and an `Intent` as parameters.
- It creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor, and then starts it.

The sink code associated with this method involves creating and starting an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, which suggests that the method is involved in handling some form of configuration update or installation process triggered by an intent.

Given similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and their code snippets are nearly identical to the one provided for `onReceive`, it indicates that these methods are likely part of a standard Android broadcast receiver mechanism. This mechanism allows components to receive intents, which are messages used to request an action from an app component. The fact that these similar APIs have `NONE` as their access control level suggests that they do not require special permissions or pose significant risks (like accessing sensitive data directly) that would necessitate a higher access control level.

Based on this analysis and the provided information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`, as its functionality appears to be standard for broadcast receivers handling intents without directly accessing sensitive data or performing dangerous operations.
