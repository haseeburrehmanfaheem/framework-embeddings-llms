To determine the access control level for the `getVolumeRecords` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs, such as `getDisks()`, along with their access control levels.

The `getVolumeRecords` method appears to create a new `VolumeRecord` object based on the size of `this.mRecords`. The critical part of the method is where it creates a new `VolumeRecord` and returns it. This operation does not seem to involve any sensitive data or actions that could potentially harm the system or leak sensitive information.

The sink code provided focuses on the creation and return of a `VolumeRecord` object, which aligns with the behavior of creating and returning an object without apparent security implications.

Comparing this with the `getDisks()` API, which has an access control level of `NONE`, we see similarities in how both methods create and return objects (`VolumeRecord` for `getVolumeRecords` and `DiskInfo` for `getDisks`). The `getDisks()` method's access control level is `NONE`, suggesting that its operations are considered safe and do not require specific permissions or protections.

Given the information:

- The operation of `getVolumeRecords` does not seem to involve sensitive data or potentially harmful actions.
- The similarity with `getDisks()`, which has an access control level of `NONE`.
- The method's behavior aligns with creating and returning an object without security implications.

Therefore, based on these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for the `getVolumeRecords` API would be `NONE`, as it does not appear to pose any significant risks or require special permissions to execute its functionality.
