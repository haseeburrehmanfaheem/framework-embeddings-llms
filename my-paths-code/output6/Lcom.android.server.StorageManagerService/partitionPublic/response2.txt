To determine the access control level for the `partitionPublic` method, let's analyze its interactions with sinks and compare them to similar APIs provided.

The sinks involved in `partitionPublic` are:
1. `Object v3 = this.mDiskScanLatches.get(p1);`
2. `CountDownLatch v4 = new CountDownLatch(1);`
3. `Object v6 = this.mDiskScanLatches.put(p1, v4);`
4. `this.mVold.partition(p1, 0, -1);`

The critical sink here is `this.mVold.partition(p1, 0, -1);`, as it seems to interact with system-level operations (partitioning), which typically require elevated permissions.

Comparing this to the similar APIs:
- `partitionMixed(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also interacts with partitioning through `this.mVold.partition(p1, 2, p2);`, indicating system-level operations. The similarity in functionality (both involve partitioning) suggests that `partitionPublic` might require similar access control.

Given the interaction with system-level operations (partitioning), and comparing with similar APIs (`partitionMixed`) that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that `partitionPublic` should also have a strict access control level due to its potential impact on system resources and security.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the nature of the operations involved, the final access control level for the `partitionPublic` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the method's interaction with sensitive system operations that require either system or signature-level permissions to execute securely.
