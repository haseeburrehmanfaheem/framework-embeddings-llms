To determine the access control level for the `getMountedObbPath` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs provided.

The `getMountedObbPath` method appears to be retrieving a mounted OBB (Opaque Binary Blob) path based on the input parameter `p1`. The method performs checks such as ensuring `p1` is not null, verifying if the volume is primary or mounted writable, and then attempts to retrieve the path from a `VolumeInfo` object.

The similar APIs provided are both named `mountObb`, with an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs seem to be involved in mounting OBBs rather than just retrieving their paths. Despite the difference in purpose, we can observe that these APIs do not require any specific permissions or access controls (hence the `NONE` level).

Given this context, let's consider the nature of the `getMountedObbPath` method:

1. **Purpose**: It retrieves a path, which is essentially a read operation.
2. **Similarity to `mountObb` APIs**: Although it serves a different purpose (retrieval vs. mounting), the underlying operations are related to OBB management.
3. **Access Control of Similar APIs**: The similar `mountObb` APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not pose significant risks or require special permissions.

Considering these points, it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `getMountedObbPath` method, as it does not appear to introduce additional risks that would necessitate stricter access controls like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of its functionality and comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `getMountedObbPath` API can be determined as follows:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This determination aligns with the principle that operations which do not pose significant security risks or require special handling should have minimal access controls.
