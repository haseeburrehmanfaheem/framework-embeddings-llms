To determine the access control level for the `forgetAllVolumes` method, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of `forgetAllVolumes`:**
   - The method clears all volume records (`this.mRecords.clear();`).
   - It checks if the primary storage UUID is equal to `StorageManager.UUID_PRIVATE_INTERNAL` and updates `this.mPrimaryStorageUuid` under certain conditions.
   - It writes settings to a file using `FileOutputStream`.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **getPrimaryStorageUuid():** This method has an access control level of `NONE` because it simply returns the primary storage UUID without modifying any system settings or accessing sensitive information that could pose a security risk.
   - **getAllocatableBytes():** This method is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission. It interacts with system services (`StorageManager`) and accesses file system information (usable space, storage low bytes, storage full bytes), which can be sensitive operations requiring elevated permissions.

3. **Access Control Level Determination for `forgetAllVolumes`:**
   - The method modifies system settings by clearing volume records and potentially changing the primary storage UUID.
   - It also writes to a file, which could imply modifying system configuration or data.
   - Given these operations, assigning an access control level of `NONE` seems inappropriate because it involves more than just retrieving information; it modifies system state.
   - Between `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, and `SYS_OR_SIG`, the choice depends on the sensitivity and potential impact of forgetting all volumes. This operation could significantly affect the system's storage management, potentially leading to data loss or security vulnerabilities if misused.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate access control level for `forgetAllVolumes` would be `DANGEROUS`. This is because it involves operations that can significantly impact the system (clearing volume records and modifying primary storage UUID), which could have serious consequences, such as data loss or security breaches, if not properly managed.

This assignment reflects the potential risks associated with the method's functionality, ensuring that it is treated with caution and appropriately secured to prevent misuse.
