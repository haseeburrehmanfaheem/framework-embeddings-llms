Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `unmountObb` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `unmountObb` method interacts with the `StorageManagerService$ObbState` and `StorageManagerService$UnmountObbAction` classes, which are also used in the similar API `mountObb`. The `mountObb` API has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that it does not require any special permissions or access controls.

The `getMountedObbPath` API, another similar API, also has an access control level of `NONE`. This API retrieves information about mounted OBB paths, which is related to the functionality of `unmountObb`.

The sink code in `unmountObb` creates a new `StorageManagerService$ObbState` object and sends a message to the `mObbActionHandler` to unmount the OBB. This operation does not seem to require any sensitive permissions or access controls.

Considering the similarity between `unmountObb` and the other APIs, as well as the functionality of the method, it is likely that `unmountObb` should have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
