After analyzing the provided code paths for the `addUserKeyAuth` API, we can identify potential sinks based on the given positive and negative rules. Here's the analysis:

1. **Path 1:**
   - The method `addUserKeyAuth` is invoked with parameters `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - There's a check using `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(p3)` to ensure that `p3` is not empty.
   - If `p3` is not empty, its contents are converted to a hexadecimal string using `HexDump.toHexString(p3)`.
   - This string (`v2`) and the original parameters `p1` and `p2` are then passed to another method `this.mVold.addUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)`.

   Based on the positive rules:
   - The method invocation `this.mVold.addUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)` follows the rule of taking input parameters as arguments and has naming similarity with the API name.
   
   Therefore, this path contains a potential sink.

2. **Path 2:**
   - This path is similar to Path 1 up until the conversion of `p3` to a hexadecimal string (`v4`) and its assignment to `v2`.
   - However, unlike Path 1, there's no further method invocation that utilizes these variables in a way that would be considered a sink according to the provided rules.
   
   Given this analysis, Path 2 does not contain a potential sink based on the criteria.

**JSON Output:**

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "boolean v3 = ArrayUtils.isEmpty(p3);",
        "String v4 = HexDump.toHexString(p3);",
        "String v2 = v4;",
        "this.mVold.addUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2);"
    ]
]
}
```

This JSON represents the identified sink in Path 1. The instructions listed are directly related to the processing and potential exposure of sensitive data (`p3`), following at least one of the positive rules (naming similarity with the API name and taking input parameters as arguments).
