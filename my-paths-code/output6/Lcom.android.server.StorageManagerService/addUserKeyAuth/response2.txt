To determine the access control level for the `addUserKeyAuth` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method takes three parameters: two integers (`p1`, `p2`) and a byte array (`p3`).
   - It checks if the byte array is empty. If not, it converts the byte array to a hexadecimal string using `HexDump.toHexString(p3)`.
   - This string is then passed to `this.mVold.addUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)` in one of the paths, indicating an interaction with a potentially sensitive operation related to user key authentication.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves checking for an empty byte array and converting it to a hexadecimal string, which is similar to the operations performed within the `addUserKeyAuth` method.
   - It also shows a call to `this.mVold.addUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)`, suggesting that the operation has implications for user authentication or security.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `clearUserKeyAuth(II[B)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also interacts with user key authentication but performs a clearing operation.
   - Another similar API, `unlockUserKey(II[B)V`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves unlocking a user key based on provided parameters.

Given these analyses:

- The operations within `addUserKeyAuth` and its interactions with potentially sensitive security functions (like adding user key authentication) suggest that it deals with security-related functionality.
- Both similar APIs (`clearUserKeyAuth` and `unlockUserKey`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require significant permissions, likely due to their impact on system or signature-level security aspects.

Considering the above points, it's reasonable to infer that the `addUserKeyAuth` method also requires a similar level of access control due to its involvement in user key authentication processes. Thus, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems appropriate for this method as well.
