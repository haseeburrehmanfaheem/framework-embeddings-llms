Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `partitionPrivate` method.

The `partitionPrivate` method has three paths with similar code snippets, and all of them interact with the same sinks:

1. `UserInfo v6 = v3.getUserInfo(v4);`
2. `CountDownLatch v9 = p0.findOrCreateDiskScanLatch(p1);`
3. `this.mVold.partition(p1, 1, -1);`
4. `p0.waitForLatch(v9, "partitionPrivate", 180000);`

The similar API `partitionMixed` has a similarity score of 0.7943829894065857 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with the same sinks:

1. `CountDownLatch v9 = p0.findOrCreateDiskScanLatch(p1);`
2. `this.mVold.partition(p1, 2, p2);`

Considering the similarity between the two APIs and their interactions with the same sinks, it is likely that the `partitionPrivate` method requires a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `partitionPrivate` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
