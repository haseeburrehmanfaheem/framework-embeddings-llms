To determine the access control level for the `isUserKeyUnlocked` method, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `isUserKeyUnlocked` method checks if a given user key is unlocked by verifying if the user ID (`p1`) is contained in the `users` array. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the user key is unlocked or not.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `lockUserKey(I)V` (Similarity Score: 0.8132171034812927) - This API locks a user key and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also interacts with the `users` array by removing the user ID from it.
2. `lockUserKey(I)V` (Similarity Score: 0.7863550782203674) - This API also locks a user key and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although its code snippet is slightly different, it still interacts with the `users` array.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. However, the `isUserKeyUnlocked` method only reads from the `users` array and does not modify it. This suggests that it may not require the same level of access control as the `lockUserKey` APIs.

Given the semantics of the `isUserKeyUnlocked` method and its comparison with the similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to this method. This is because it only performs a read operation on the `users` array and does not modify any sensitive data or perform any actions that require system or signature-level permissions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
