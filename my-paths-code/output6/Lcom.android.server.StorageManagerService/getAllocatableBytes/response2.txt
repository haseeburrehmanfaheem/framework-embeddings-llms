To determine the access control level for the `getAllocatableBytes` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of `getAllocatableBytes`:**
   - The method interacts with `AppOpsManager` to check if an operation is active, which suggests a level of permission or access control.
   - It uses `StorageManager` to find paths for UUIDs, get usable space, and retrieve storage low and full bytes. These operations imply access to sensitive system information but do not directly modify data.
   - The method also involves calculations related to cache bytes and quota support, indicating a complex logic possibly requiring specific permissions or access levels.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`allocateBytes` API:**
     - Has an Access Control Level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
     - Checks for operation activity using `AppOpsManager`, similar to `getAllocatableBytes`.
     - The high similarity score (0.9383854269981384) suggests that the access control logic might be comparable.
   - **`getFreeBytes` API:**
     - Has an Access Control Level of `NONE`.
     - Also interacts with storage-related components but lacks the explicit operation activity check seen in `getAllocatableBytes` and `allocateBytes`.
     - The lower similarity score (0.8709793090820312) compared to `allocateBytes` might indicate differences in access control requirements.

Given these observations:

- **Similarity with `allocateBytes`:** The high similarity, including the use of `AppOpsManager` for operation activity checks, suggests that `getAllocatableBytes` could require a similar level of access control.
- **Interaction with System Components:** The method's interaction with system components like `StorageManager` and checks for operation activities imply a need for a controlled access environment.

**Conclusion:**
Given the analysis and comparison, assigning an access control level to `getAllocatableBytes` that matches its closest functional and operational counterpart (`allocateBytes`) seems reasonable. Therefore, the access control level for `getAllocatableBytes` should be `SYS_OR_SIG`, considering its interactions with system services and the similarity in logic with `allocateBytes`.
