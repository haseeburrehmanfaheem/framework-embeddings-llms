The method benchmark has the following code snippet:

This is path 1 for the API with depth 0:
public void benchmark(String p1, IVoldTaskListener p2){
	StorageManagerService$8 v2 = new StorageManagerService$8(p0,p2);
	this.mVold.benchmark(p1, v2);
	return;
}

and the following sink code:
['StorageManagerService$8 v2 = new StorageManagerService$8(p0,p2);\nthis.mVold.benchmark(p1, v2);']

The method benchmark has the following similar APIs:

- API Name: runIdleMaintenance()V with Similarity Score: 0.7088603973388672
  - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG and the following code:
StorageManagerService$10 v9 = new StorageManagerService$10(StorageManagerService,0);
this.mVold.runIdleMaint(this.mNeedGC, v9);
