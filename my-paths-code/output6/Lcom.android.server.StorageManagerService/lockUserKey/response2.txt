To determine the access control level for the `lockUserKey` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets and Sinks**: The code snippets show that the method interacts with `this.mVold.lockUserKey(p1)`, which suggests an interaction with a potentially sensitive system component (`mVold` could be related to volume or storage management), and modifies an internal state by removing an integer from an array (`ArrayUtils.removeInt(this.users, p1)`). The presence of sinks like `this.mVold.lockUserKey(p1)` indicates that this method is performing a security-related action.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **isUserKeyUnlocked(I)Z**: This API has an access control level of `NONE` and checks if a user key is unlocked by verifying the presence of the user ID in an array. Its similarity score with `lockUserKey` suggests some operational overlap, but its access control level does not directly imply security risks since it's more about querying a state rather than altering it.
   - **unlockUserKey(II[B)V**: With an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method is involved in unlocking a user key and requires system or signature-level permissions. The operation involves encoding bytes and then calling `this.mVold.unlockUserKey(p1, p2, v18)`, which is a security-sensitive action.

Given the above points:

- **lockUserKey** interacts with potentially sensitive system components (`mVold`) and modifies internal states related to user keys.
- The method's actions (locking a user key, removing from an array of users) have implications for device security and access control.
- The presence of `SYS_OR_SIG` level access control in the similar API **unlockUserKey** suggests that operations related to user key management are considered sensitive.

Considering these factors, the `lockUserKey` method's interaction with system components and its role in managing user key states (which is security-related) suggest it should have a higher access control level than `NONE`. Given that unlocking requires `SYS_OR_SIG`, locking (which is essentially the opposite operation but still impactful on device security) would logically also require careful permission management.

Therefore, considering the implications of its actions and the precedent set by similar APIs involved in user key management, the most appropriate access control level for the `lockUserKey` method seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects the need for either system-level or signature-level permissions to perform such security-sensitive operations.
