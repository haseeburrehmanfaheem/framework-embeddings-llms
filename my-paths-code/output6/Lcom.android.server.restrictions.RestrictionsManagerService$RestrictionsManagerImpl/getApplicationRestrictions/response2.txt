To determine the access control level for the `getApplicationRestrictions` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `getApplicationRestrictions` method has a simple implementation:
```java
public Bundle getApplicationRestrictions(String p1){
    Bundle v1 = this.mUm.getApplicationRestrictions(p1);
    return v1;
}
```
It calls another method `getApplicationRestrictions` on an object `mUm` and returns the result.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `hasBaseUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` with a similarity score of 0.8214102387428284 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `markGuestForDeletion(I)Z` with a similarity score of 0.7582123279571533 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive information.

The `getApplicationRestrictions` method seems to be retrieving application restrictions, which could be considered sensitive information. The fact that it has a high similarity score with `hasBaseUserRestriction` and `markGuestForDeletion`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggests that `getApplicationRestrictions` may also require similar access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getApplicationRestrictions` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
