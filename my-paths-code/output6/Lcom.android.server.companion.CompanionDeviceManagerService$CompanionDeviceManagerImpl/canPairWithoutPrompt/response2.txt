To assign an access control level to the `canPairWithoutPrompt` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `canPairWithoutPrompt` API appears to be checking if a device can pair without prompting the user. It uses the `MacAddress.fromString` method to convert an integer to a MAC address and then checks if there are any associations with that address in the `mAddressMap`. If there are, it iterates over them and checks if any of them have been approved within the last 10 minutes.

The similar APIs provided, `notifyDeviceAppeared` and `legacyDisassociate`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs seem to be interacting with the same `AssociationStoreImpl` class and are performing operations related to device associations.

Given the similarity in functionality and the fact that `canPairWithoutPrompt` is also interacting with the `AssociationStoreImpl` class, it's likely that this API should have a similar access control level.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `canPairWithoutPrompt` does not seem to be modifying any system state or performing any sensitive operations. It appears to be a read-only operation, checking if a device can pair without prompting the user.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `canPairWithoutPrompt` API. This is because it does not seem to require the same level of system or signature privileges as the similar APIs, but still requires some level of access control to ensure that only authorized components can check if a device can pair without prompting the user.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

Note: The `NONE` access control level seems unlikely, as the API is still interacting with system components and performing some level of checking. The `DANGEROUS` access control level also seems unlikely, as the API does not appear to be performing any sensitive or potentially harmful operations. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level seems too restrictive, given the read-only nature of the API.
