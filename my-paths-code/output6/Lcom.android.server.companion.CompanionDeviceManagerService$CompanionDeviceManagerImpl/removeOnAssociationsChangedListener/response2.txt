To determine the access control level for the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method has a code snippet that includes a call to `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerCanManageCompanionDevice(v7, "removeOnAssociationsChangedListener");`. This line suggests that the method is enforcing a specific permission check, which implies that it requires a certain level of access control.

The similar API `addOnAssociationsChangedListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires either system or signature-level permission. The code for this API also includes a registration process with `RemoteCallbackList`, similar to the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method.

On the other hand, the `registerContentCaptureOptionsCallback` API has an access control level of `NONE`, but its code snippet does not include any explicit permission checks like the `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerCanManageCompanionDevice` call in the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method requires a similar access control level as the `addOnAssociationsChangedListener` API, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because both methods interact with the same `RemoteCallbackList` and are likely to require similar permission checks.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the comparison with similar APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
