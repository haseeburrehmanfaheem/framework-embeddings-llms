To determine the access control level for the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The method's code involves checking permissions using `PermissionsUtils.checkCallerCanManageAssociationsForPackage`, which suggests a certain level of access control is in place.

Here are key points from the code:

1. **Permission Check**: The method checks if the caller can manage associations for a package using `PermissionsUtils.checkCallerCanManageAssociationsForPackage`. This indicates that the method is protected by a permission check, which is crucial for determining its access control level.

2. **Similar APIs**: The similar APIs provided, such as `notifyDeviceAppeared(I)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also involve interactions with device presence monitoring and permissions checks, suggesting they require either system or signature-level permissions to be invoked.

3. **Sensitive Operations**: The `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method performs sensitive operations like removing a device from the reported self-managed devices list (`this.mReportedSelfManagedDevices.remove(v14)`) and notifying callbacks about device disappearance (`this.mCallback.onDeviceDisappeared(p1)`). These operations could potentially impact the security or privacy of the user's data.

Considering these points, the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method seems to require a level of access control that prevents arbitrary applications from invoking it without proper authorization. Since it involves permission checks and sensitive operations similar to those in APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to this method.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the method's need for protection against unauthorized access, aligning with the principles of least privilege and secure coding practices.
