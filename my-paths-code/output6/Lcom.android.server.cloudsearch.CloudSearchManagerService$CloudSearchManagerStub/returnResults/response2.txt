To determine the access control level for the `returnResults` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `returnResults` method has two paths, but both of them involve creating an instance of `CloudSearchManagerService$CloudSearchManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda1` and passing parameters `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to its constructor. This is similar to the code snippets in the provided APIs.

The first similar API, `search(Landroid/app/cloudsearch/SearchRequest;Landroid/app/cloudsearch/ICloudSearchManagerCallback;)V`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet creates an instance of `CloudSearchManagerService$CloudSearchManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` and passes parameters to its constructor, which is similar to the `returnResults` method.

The second similar API, `createSmartspaceSession(Landroid/app/smartspace/SmartspaceConfig;Landroid/app/smartspace/SmartspaceSessionId;Landroid/os/IBinder;)V`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet creates an instance of `SmartspaceManagerService$SmartspaceManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3` and passes parameters to its constructor, which is similar to the `returnResults` method.

Both similar APIs have a high similarity score with the `returnResults` method, and their access control levels are `SYS_OR_SIG`. Based on this information, it is likely that the `returnResults` method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access its functionality.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `returnResults` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
