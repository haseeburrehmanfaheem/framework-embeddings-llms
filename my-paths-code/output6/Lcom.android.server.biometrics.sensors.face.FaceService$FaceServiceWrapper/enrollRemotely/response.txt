No potential sinks are identified in this API because it does not follow any of the positive rules. The return value is a constant (-1), and there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that could contribute to a sink.

Since there are no identified sinks, the JSON output will be:

```
{
"Sinks": []
}
```
