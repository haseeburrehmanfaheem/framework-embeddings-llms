To determine the access control level for the `hasEnrolledFaces` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `hasEnrolledFaces` method checks if there are enrolled faces for a given set of parameters (integers and a string). It iterates through service providers, checks for the presence of a specific sensor, and then verifies if there are any enrolled faces associated with that sensor.

2. **Analyzing Paths**: All paths provided show similar logic:
   - They iterate over `mServiceProviders`.
   - Check if the iterator has a next element.
   - Attempt to retrieve the next element (though in path 1 and 3, this seems to be incorrectly represented as it should not proceed if `hasNext()` returns false).
   - For each service provider, they check if it contains a specific sensor based on `p2`.
   - If a sensor is found, some paths then check for enrolled faces (e.g., path 2).

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets provided are essentially doing the same thing as parts of the paths described:
   - Iterating over service providers.
   - Checking for the presence of a specific sensor.
   - Retrieving enrolled faces if such a sensor is found.

4. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`enroll` and `startPreparedClient`) have been assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`.
   - These APIs interact with service providers, check for sensors, and perform operations related to face enrollment or client preparation.
   - The `enroll` API is particularly relevant as it involves enrolling faces (similar to the concept of having enrolled faces), indicating that operations related to face enrollment are considered `NORMAL` in terms of access control.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the similarities between the `hasEnrolledFaces` method and the provided APIs, both in logic and in interaction with service providers and sensors, it's reasonable to conclude that the access control level for `hasEnrolledFaces` should also be `NORMAL`. This is because:
   - The method does not seem to perform any operations that would require elevated permissions (like direct hardware manipulation or sensitive data exposure beyond what's expected for face recognition services).
   - It aligns with the existing classification of similar face service-related APIs.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
