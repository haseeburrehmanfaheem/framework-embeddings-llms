To determine the access control level for the `cancelFaceDetect` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided `cancelFaceDetect` method interacts with several components, including:

1. `FaceService.getSensorProperties()`: This is a common point of interaction among the compared APIs.
2. `this.mServiceProviders.iterator()`: Iteration over service providers is another shared aspect.
3. `Pair.second.cancelFaceDetect(v23, p1, p3)`: The method calls `cancelFaceDetect` on a service provider.

Comparing this with similar APIs:

- **authenticate**: Has an access control level of NORMAL. It also interacts with `FaceService.getSensorProperties()` and iterates over service providers to schedule authentication.
- **getFeature**: Similarly has an access control level of NORMAL. It follows a comparable pattern, involving `FaceService.getSensorProperties()` and interaction with service providers to get a feature.

Both similar APIs have a NORMAL access control level, and their interactions with system components (like getting sensor properties and working with service providers) are comparable to the `cancelFaceDetect` method's behavior. The primary actions (authentication, getting features, and canceling face detection) seem to be operations that would typically require some form of access control but do not appear to directly interact with highly sensitive or dangerous functionality without proper checks.

Given these observations:

- The `cancelFaceDetect` method does not seem to perform any operations that would classify it as DANGEROUS (e.g., direct access to sensitive user data without additional checks, performing system-level actions that could compromise the device's security).
- It also doesn't fit into the SYS_OR_SIG category, as its functionality is more application-level than system-level or signal-level.
- The method involves interactions with components in a way that suggests some level of control or restriction is necessary (thus not NONE), but it aligns closely with NORMAL access control levels observed in similar APIs.

**Conclusion**: Based on the comparison and analysis, the `cancelFaceDetect` method should have an access control level of **NORMAL**, as it aligns with the behavior and security considerations of similar methods that interact with face service providers without indicating a need for higher or lower access controls.
