To assign an access control level to the `removeAll` method, we should consider the similarity scores and code snippets of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the `removeAll` method itself.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**:
   - The `removeAll` method has a high similarity score (0.7906144857406616) with another `removeAll` method that has an access control level of `NORMAL`. This suggests that the operation of removing all items, in this context, does not require elevated permissions or pose significant risks.
   - It also has a notable similarity score (0.7320857644081116) with a `registerAuthenticators` method, which is also classified as `NORMAL`. Although the operations are different (removal vs. registration), the similarity in access control level indicates that both methods might be dealing with data or services in a way that doesn't necessitate high-level permissions.

2. **Code Semantics**:
   - The code snippet for `removeAll` involves creating an instance of `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper$1`, which seems to be related to handling face service receivers. This operation, by itself, does not inherently suggest a need for dangerous or system-level permissions.
   - The method iterates over a list of service providers (`this.mServiceProviders`) and potentially removes them based on certain conditions. This kind of data manipulation is common in application logic and doesn't typically require special access control.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not interact with sensitive data or services.
   - `NORMAL`: Applies to most methods that perform standard operations without needing elevated permissions.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Reserved for methods that could potentially cause harm if misused, such as those interacting with sensitive user data or system resources.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Used for methods that require system or signature-level permissions, usually because they interact closely with the system or perform actions that could affect other apps.

Considering these points, the `removeAll` method seems to fit best with the `NORMAL` access control level. It's involved in managing service providers and doesn't appear to handle sensitive data or operations that would necessitate higher permission levels.
