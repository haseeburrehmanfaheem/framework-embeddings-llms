To determine the access control level for the `remove` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method interacts with sensitive face service properties and providers.
   - It checks for specific sensor properties and schedules a removal operation if certain conditions are met.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves getting sensor properties, creating pairs of values (including sensor IDs), and scheduling a remove operation on a pair's second element.
   - This indicates interaction with potentially sensitive data or operations.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setFeature Method**:
     - Similarity Score: 0.8260595798492432
     - Access Control Level: NORMAL
     - This method also interacts with face service properties and schedules a set feature operation, which is somewhat similar in nature to the remove operation.
   - **cancelFaceDetect Method**:
     - Similarity Score: 0.7991797924041748
     - Access Control Level: NORMAL
     - This method involves canceling a face detection operation, which also deals with sensitive data but seems less directly related to the removal of service providers or properties.

Given these points, we can infer that:
- The `remove` method handles potentially sensitive operations related to face service providers and sensor properties.
- Both similar APIs (`setFeature` and `cancelFaceDetect`) have an access control level of NORMAL, indicating they deal with sensitive data or operations but are not restricted to system or signature levels.

Considering the nature of the operations (removal of a service provider based on specific conditions and interaction with face service sensor properties), it seems reasonable that this method should be treated with a similar level of caution as the provided examples. However, without explicit system-level or signature-level restrictions indicated by the code or similar APIs, we lean towards the access control level being consistent with the similar APIs provided.

**Final Access Control Level**:
Given the similarities in functionality and the handling of potentially sensitive data, but lacking specific indicators for higher restriction levels (like system or signature), the most appropriate access control level seems to be **NORMAL**. This aligns with the treatment of similar methods that interact with face service properties and operations.
