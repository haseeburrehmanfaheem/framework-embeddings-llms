To determine the access control level for the `cancelEnrollment` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The method interacts with face sensor properties and service providers, which suggests that it handles sensitive biometric data.

The two paths of the `cancelEnrollment` method have some similarities with the provided APIs:

1.  **Path 1:** This path calls `Pair.second.cancelEnrollment(v15, p1, p2)`, which is similar to the code in `cancelFingerprintDetect` and `remove`. These APIs also call methods like `cancelAuthentication` and `scheduleRemove` on a paired object.

2.  **Path 2:** Although this path does not make an actual method call like Path 1, its logic and structure are comparable to those of the similar APIs.

Considering these similarities, we can infer that the `cancelEnrollment` method likely requires access control similar to that of `cancelFingerprintDetect` and `remove`, both of which have an access control level of **NORMAL**. This level suggests that while the method does interact with sensitive data (in this case, face enrollment), it is not considered highly privileged or dangerous.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the access control level for the `cancelEnrollment` API should also be **NORMAL**, reflecting its interaction with biometric data and its similarity to other APIs with normal access controls.

Here's the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
