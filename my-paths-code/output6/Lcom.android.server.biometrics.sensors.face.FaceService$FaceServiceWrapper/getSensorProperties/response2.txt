To determine the access control level for the `getSensorProperties` method, we should analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs. 

The given API has three paths, but the most relevant one in terms of accessing sensor properties is path 3, which shows a clear interaction with a sensor provider to retrieve sensor properties based on certain parameters (`p1` and `p2`). This path includes checking if a service provider contains a specific sensor and then attempting to get the sensor properties from it.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. The API `getSensorProperties(ILjava/lang/String;)Landroid/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintSensorPropertiesInternal;` has a similarity score of 0.8615967631340027 and an access control level of NORMAL. Its code snippet shows a direct call to `v3.getSensorProperties(p1)` after checking if the sensor is contained within a provider, which closely resembles the logic in path 3 of our API.

2. The API `isHardwareDetected(ILjava/lang/String;)Z` has a similarity score of 0.8361781239509583 and an access control level of NORMAL. Although its purpose (detecting hardware) differs from getting sensor properties, it also interacts with service providers to query about specific sensors, showing a similar pattern of accessing provider services.

Given these similarities in code patterns and the fact that both comparison APIs have an access control level of NORMAL, we can infer that the `getSensorProperties` method likely requires a moderate level of access control. It doesn't seem to involve highly sensitive operations that would warrant a DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG classification, nor does it appear so benign as to require NONE. Thus, aligning with the compared APIs' access levels, we conclude that the appropriate access control level for `getSensorProperties` should also be NORMAL.
