To determine the access control level for the `enroll` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `enroll` method interacts with sensitive face recognition sensor properties and schedules an enrollment process. This suggests that it handles potentially sensitive user data.

Looking at the similar APIs:

1. The `enroll` method from `FingerprintService` has a similarity score of 0.8352742195129395 and an access control level of `NORMAL`. Although it deals with fingerprint sensor properties, which are also sensitive, its access control level is `NORMAL`.
2. The `authenticate` method from `FaceService` has a similarity score of 0.8316609859466553 and an access control level of `NORMAL`. This method interacts with face recognition sensor properties, similar to the `enroll` method, and also has an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Considering these similarities and the fact that the `enroll` method handles sensitive user data, it's reasonable to assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to this method.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarity between the `enroll` method and other APIs that interact with sensitive user data, as well as their assigned access control levels.
