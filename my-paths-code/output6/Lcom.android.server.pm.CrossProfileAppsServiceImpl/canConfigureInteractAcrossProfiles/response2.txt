To assign an access control level to the `canConfigureInteractAcrossProfiles` method, we must analyze its code paths, sinks, and similar APIs. The method involves checking if a profile owner can configure interactions across profiles, which includes interactions with user management and app ops.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**: 
   - Both paths involve getting the calling user ID, retrieving profile IDs from the `UserManager`, and checking if there are at least two profiles.
   - They then check if the given profile is an owner among these profiles using `CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl.isProfileOwner`.
   - The critical difference in logic comes after this point, involving checks related to app ops permissions (`AppOpsManager.opToPermission(93)`) and executing lambda functions with clean calling identity. However, both paths aim to determine if the interaction across profiles can be configured based on profile ownership and specific app op permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sinks involve getting the calling user ID, interacting with `UserManager` for profile IDs, checking profile ownership, and executing operations related to app ops permissions.
   - These operations are sensitive as they deal with user profiles and app permissions, suggesting a need for access control.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **`canRequestInteractAcrossProfiles`**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`, which seems less restrictive. However, its functionality is closely related to checking profile ownership and enabled profiles, which might not directly involve sensitive operations like changing app ops or configuring interactions across profiles.
   - **`setInteractAcrossProfilesAppOp`**: With an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this API implies a higher level of restriction, likely due to its involvement in setting app ops for interacting across profiles. This operation is more sensitive and potentially impactful on the system's security and functionality.

Given these considerations:
- The method `canConfigureInteractAcrossProfiles` involves checking and potentially configuring interactions across different user profiles based on profile ownership and specific permissions.
- While it does not directly modify system settings like `setInteractAcrossProfilesAppOp`, its checks and potential actions based on app ops permissions indicate a need for some level of access control.
- However, compared to `setInteractAcrossProfilesAppOp`, the operations are more about checking capabilities rather than applying changes, which might suggest a slightly lower risk profile.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects the method's involvement with user profiles and app permissions without directly altering system settings or sensitive data in a way that would necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` access control. It also acknowledges that some form of access control is necessary due to its interaction with profile management and app ops, thus not being `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level:**
