Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method appears to be related to HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) settings, and it retrieves a list of allowed string values for a specific setting. The method uses `HdmiCecConfig` and `HdmiCecConfig$Setting` objects to interact with the CEC settings.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `shouldHandleTvPowerKey()Z` with a similarity score of 0.9023313522338867 and an access control level of NONE.
2. `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues(Ljava/lang/String;)[I` with a similarity score of 0.8671354055404663 and an access control level of NONE.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or access controls to function.

Upon reviewing the code snippets for the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method, I notice that it uses `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` and `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` to manage the calling identity and work source UID. However, these calls do not seem to imply any specific access control requirements.

Considering the similarities with the other APIs and the lack of explicit access control mechanisms in the code, I conclude that the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method should have an access control level of NONE.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
