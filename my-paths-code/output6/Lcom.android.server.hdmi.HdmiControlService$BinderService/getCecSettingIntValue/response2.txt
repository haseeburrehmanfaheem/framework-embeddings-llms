Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getCecSettingIntValue` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getCecSettingIntValue` method retrieves an integer value from a CEC setting, which involves reading from shared preferences or global settings. The sink code snippets indicate that the method returns an integer value parsed from a string retrieved from storage.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `setCecSettingIntValue(Ljava/lang/String;I)V`: This method sets an integer value for a CEC setting and has an access control level of `NONE`. It stores the integer value as a string in shared preferences.
2. `getCecSettingStringValue(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`: This method retrieves a string value from a CEC setting and also has an access control level of `NONE`. It reads a string value from shared preferences.

Considering the similarities between these APIs, it appears that they all interact with CEC settings and storage in a relatively safe manner. They do not seem to perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions or pose a significant risk to the system or user data.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the `getCecSettingIntValue` method should have an access control level of `NONE`, as it is similar to the other APIs in terms of its functionality and potential risks.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
