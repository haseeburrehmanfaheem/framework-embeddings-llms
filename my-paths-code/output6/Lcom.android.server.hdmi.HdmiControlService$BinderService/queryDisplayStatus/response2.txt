To determine the access control level for the `queryDisplayStatus` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet**: The method involves setting a work source UID to the calling UID and then executing a service thread with a callback.
2. **Sink Code**: It specifically mentions running a service thread with a binder service instance.
3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V` has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `deviceSelect(ILandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` also has an access control level of `NONE`.

Both similar APIs have the same pattern of running a service thread with a binder service instance and are assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the operations they perform do not require special permissions or pose significant risks to the system or user data.

Given this analysis, since the `queryDisplayStatus` method follows a similar operational pattern (running a service thread with a callback), it's reasonable to conclude that its access control level should also be `NONE`. This is because it does not seem to interact with sensitive data or perform actions that would typically require elevated permissions or special handling.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
