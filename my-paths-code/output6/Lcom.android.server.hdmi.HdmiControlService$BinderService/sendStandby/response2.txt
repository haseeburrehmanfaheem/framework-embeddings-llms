To determine the access control level for the `sendStandby` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `sendStandby` method has a code snippet that involves creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$16` and then running it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`. This pattern is similar to the code snippets of the two provided similar APIs: `setSystemAudioMode` and `portSelect`.

Both `setSystemAudioMode` and `portSelect` have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require any specific permissions or access controls to be executed. The similarity in code patterns between these APIs and `sendStandby`, particularly in how they create a service binder instance and run it on the service thread, suggests that `sendStandby` might also not require stringent access control.

Given this analysis, the final access control level for the `sendStandby` API can be determined as follows:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the similarity in code structure and functionality with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that `sendStandby` does not pose significant risks or require special permissions to execute.
