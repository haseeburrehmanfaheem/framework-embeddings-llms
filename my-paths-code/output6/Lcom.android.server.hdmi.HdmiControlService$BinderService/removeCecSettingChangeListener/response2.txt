To determine the access control level for the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - The method has three paths, but all of them essentially check if a listener (`p2`) is registered in `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords`. If it is, they attempt to unregister it.
   - In path 2, after checking the registration count, it calls `this.mHdmiCecConfig.removeChangeListener(p2, this.mSettingChangeListener);`, which directly interacts with a system configuration.
   - The sink code involves removing a listener from `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords` and from `mHdmiCecConfig`, indicating direct manipulation of system settings or configurations.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`addCecSettingChangeListener`) have an access control level of `NONE`. However, their functionality is opposite to `removeCecSettingChangeListener`; they add listeners instead of removing them.
   - Despite the difference in operation (adding vs. removing), these APIs interact with system configurations or settings by registering/unregistering change listeners.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `removeCecSettingChangeListener` directly manipulates system settings by removing a registered listener, it's reasonable to consider an access control level that reflects its potential impact on the system.
   - The method does not seem to pose a significant risk that would categorize it as `DANGEROUS`, which typically involves sensitive operations like accessing user data or making financial transactions.
   - It also doesn't appear to be `SYS_OR_SIG` since this level usually applies to methods that require system or signature-level permissions, which is not indicated by the provided information.
   - Considering its interaction with system settings and comparison with similar APIs, an access control level of `NONE` seems inappropriate due to the method's potential impact on system configurations.

Given these considerations, the most fitting access control level for `removeCecSettingChangeListener` would be `NORMAL`. This reflects its ability to modify system settings by removing registered listeners without posing a significant risk that would require higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
