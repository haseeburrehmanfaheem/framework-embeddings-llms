To determine the access control level for the `getDeviceList` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getDeviceList` method involves setting the work source UID to the calling UID and then retrieves a list of safe Cec devices locked through the `HdmiCecNetwork` instance. This operation seems to be related to managing or accessing HDMI device lists, which could involve sensitive operations but does not explicitly indicate a high level of danger or system-level sensitivity.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code focuses on getting and returning a list of safe Cec devices locked, reinforcing the idea that this method is about retrieving information regarding connected devices.

3. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The similar API `getSystemAudioMode()` has an access control level of `NONE`. This API seems to deal with audio mode settings, which could be related to device settings but doesn't necessarily imply a high-risk operation.
   - The similarity score between `getDeviceList` and `getSystemAudioMode()` is 0.7139061689376831, indicating a moderate to high level of similarity in their functionality or implementation.

Given these points:

- **Security Implications**: The method does not seem to directly manipulate system resources in a dangerous way (like executing commands, accessing sensitive data without permission, etc.) but rather retrieves information about connected devices.
- **Comparison with Similar APIs**: Since the similar API has an access control level of `NONE`, and considering that our method is more about retrieving device list information which might not be as sensitive or risky as operations categorized under `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer its access control level.

**Conclusion**:

Given the nature of the operation (retrieving a list of devices), the similarity with another API that has an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the potential sensitivity of device information, the most appropriate access control level for the `getDeviceList` method would be `NORMAL`. This is because while it doesn't seem to pose significant risks akin to `DANGEROUS` operations or require system-level permissions like `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's also not entirely devoid of any access control (`NONE`) due to its interaction with device information.
