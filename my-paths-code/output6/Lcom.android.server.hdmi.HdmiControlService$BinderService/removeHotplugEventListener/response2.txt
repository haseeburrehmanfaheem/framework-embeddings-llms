Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `removeHotplugEventListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeHotplugEventListener` method is used to remove a hotplug event listener from the `HdmiControlService`. The method iterates over the list of registered listeners and removes the specified listener if found. The sink code snippet shows that the method interacts with the `mHotplugEventListenerRecords` list and uses the `unlinkToDeath` and `remove` methods to remove the listener.

The similar APIs, `addHotplugEventListener` and `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with lists of registered listeners and use similar operations (e.g., `linkToDeath` and `add` for `addHotplugEventListener`, and `unlinkToDeath` and `remove` for `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`) to manage the listeners.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeHotplugEventListener` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because the method does not perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions or access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `removeHotplugEventListener` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
