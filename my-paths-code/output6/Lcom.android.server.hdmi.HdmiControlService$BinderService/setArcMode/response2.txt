To assign an access control level to the `setArcMode` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `setArcMode` method has a code snippet that involves setting the work source UID to the calling UID and running a service thread. The sink code also involves running a service thread. 

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource()` has an access control level of `NONE` and its code snippet is very similar, involving running a service thread.
2. `startOneTouchRecord(I[B)V` also has an access control level of `NONE` and its code snippet involves running a service thread with multiple parameters.

Given the similarity in code snippets and the fact that both comparison APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that the `setArcMode` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
