To determine the access control level for the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The similar APIs (`deviceSelect` and `portSelect`) both have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that operations related to controlling or selecting devices/ports do not require elevated permissions.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet for `powerOnRemoteDevice` involves creating a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` and running it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`. This pattern is consistent with the similar APIs provided, where they also create instances of different classes (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$1` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2`) and run them on the service thread.
   - The key aspect here is the interaction with `HdmiControlService` and the execution on a service thread, which seems to be a common pattern for controlling HDMI-related operations.

3. **Semantics of the APIs:**
   - All these methods seem to interact with the HDMI control service in some capacity, either selecting devices/ports or, in the case of `powerOnRemoteDevice`, powering on a remote device.
   - The semantics imply that these operations are part of the normal functionality of an application that interacts with HDMI devices.

4. **Access Control Decision:**
   - Given the similarity in code pattern and semantics with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that `powerOnRemoteDevice` is also performing a standard operation within its domain.
   - There's no indication from the provided information that this method requires special or elevated permissions (like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`) to execute.

Based on these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for the `powerOnRemoteDevice` API would be `NONE`, as it aligns with the pattern and semantics of similar APIs without requiring elevated permissions.
