To determine the access control level for the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method, we should analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method is designed to remove a listener that has been previously registered to receive updates on HDMI control status changes.
   - It iterates through a list of registered listeners, checks if the listener to be removed matches any in the list (based on their binder identity), and if so, unlinks the death recipient and removes the listener record from its internal list.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **`removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`**: This method has a similar purpose but for system audio mode change listeners. It also iterates through registered listeners, checks for matches based on their binder identity, unlinks death recipients if necessary, and removes listener records. Its access control level is `NONE`.
   - **`addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`**: Although this method adds a listener rather than removing one, its purpose is closely related to the management of HDMI control status change listeners. It creates a new record for the listener and adds it to the internal list without any apparent access control checks beyond what's inherent in adding a listener. Its access control level is also `NONE`.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs (`removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` and `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that the operations related to managing these listeners do not pose significant risks or require elevated permissions.
   - The functionality of `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` aligns with the principle of least privilege, as it doesn't seem to directly manipulate sensitive data or perform actions that could compromise system security or user privacy without proper authorization.

Based on this analysis and comparison, the most appropriate access control level for the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method would be `NONE`, as it does not appear to require special permissions or pose significant security risks.
