To determine the access control level for the `stopOneTouchRecord` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `stopOneTouchRecord` method has a similarity score of over 0.98 with two other methods: `setStandbyMode` and `powerOnRemoteDevice`. Both of these methods have an access control level of `NONE`.

Looking at the code snippets, we can see that all three methods follow a similar pattern:

1. They create a new instance of a class that extends `HdmiControlService$BinderService$XX`, where `XX` is a different number for each method.
2. They call the `runOnServiceThread` method on the `this$0` object, passing the newly created instance as an argument.

The sink code for `stopOneTouchRecord` also matches this pattern.

Given the high similarity scores and the identical code patterns, it is reasonable to conclude that the `stopOneTouchRecord` method should have the same access control level as the similar APIs.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the final access control level for the `stopOneTouchRecord` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
