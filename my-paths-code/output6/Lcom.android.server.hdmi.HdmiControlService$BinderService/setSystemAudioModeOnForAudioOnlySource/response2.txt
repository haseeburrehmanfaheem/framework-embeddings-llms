To determine the access control level for the `setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The given method's code involves setting a work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` and then running a service thread with a newly created instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$24`. The key aspects here are:

1. **Setting Work Source UID**: This action involves identifying the caller's UID, which is crucial for managing and controlling access to system resources or services.
2. **Running on Service Thread**: Executing code on a service thread implies interaction with system services or performing operations that might affect system state or other apps.

Given these points, let's examine the similar APIs:

- **setArcMode(Z)V** and **reportAudioStatus(IIIZ)V** both have an access control level of **NONE**. Their code snippets show similarities in structure with `setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource`, particularly in creating a new instance of a binder service class (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$14` for `setArcMode` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$23` for `reportAudioStatus`) and running it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`. This pattern suggests that these methods are likely involved in controlling or reporting state related to HDMI services, which seems to be internal system management rather than dangerous operations like accessing sensitive user data or performing actions that could compromise system security.

Considering the similarities and the fact that both comparison APIs have an access control level of **NONE**, it is reasonable to infer that `setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource` also does not pose significant risks in terms of accessing sensitive information, making dangerous changes, or requiring special system privileges beyond what's already managed by the service threads and binder interactions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons with similar APIs, the access control level for `setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource` should also be **NONE**, as it aligns with the patterns observed in other methods that manage internal system states without apparent risks to user data or system security.
