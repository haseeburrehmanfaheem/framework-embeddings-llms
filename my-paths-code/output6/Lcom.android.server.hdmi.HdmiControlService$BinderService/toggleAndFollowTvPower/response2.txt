To determine the access control level for the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method contains two key operations:
1. It sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`.
2. It runs a service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v13);`, where `v13` is an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$6`.

The similar APIs provided, `setArcMode(Z)V` and `oneTouchPlay(Landroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V`, both have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also utilize the `runOnServiceThread` method to execute a service thread, similar to `toggleAndFollowTvPower`.

Given that:
- The similar APIs (`setArcMode` and `oneTouchPlay`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The primary operations within `toggleAndFollowTvPower` (setting work source UID and running a service thread) do not explicitly indicate a need for elevated permissions like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` based on the provided context.
- The method does interact with system-level services (e.g., `HdmiControlService`) but in a manner consistent with the similar APIs that are classified as `NONE`.

Based on this analysis, the access control level for `toggleAndFollowTvPower` should be consistent with its similar APIs, which do not require special permissions to execute their primary functions.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
