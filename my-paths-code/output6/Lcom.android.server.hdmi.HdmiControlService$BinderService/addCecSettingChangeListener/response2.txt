To determine the access control level for the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `addCecSettingChangeListener` method is designed to add a listener for changes in CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) settings. It involves registering a callback with the system so that when specific events occur (like changes in HDMI CEC settings), the registered listener is notified.

2. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Both paths involve checking if a listener already exists (`this.mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords.containsKey(p2)`). If it does, they proceed to register the new callback or handle the existing registration differently across the two paths.
   - The method interacts with `RemoteCallbackList` and `mHdmiCecConfig`, suggesting it deals with managing callbacks for system-level events.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets involve creating a new `RemoteCallbackList` instance, putting it into `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords`, and registering a change listener with `mHdmiCecConfig`. These operations are related to handling callbacks for system events.

4. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API, `removeCecSettingChangeListener`, has an access control level of `NONE`. This method is essentially the counterpart to `addCecSettingChangeListener`, as it removes listeners instead of adding them.
   - Both versions of `removeCecSettingChangeListener` provided have a high similarity score with `addCecSettingChangeListener`, indicating they share significant operational characteristics.

Given these points, we can infer that:
- The operation of adding or removing a listener for system-level events (like CEC setting changes) typically does not pose a direct risk to user privacy or system security in the way that, for example, accessing location data or making phone calls might.
- The `NONE` access control level assigned to the similar `removeCecSettingChangeListener` API suggests that these kinds of operations are considered safe and do not require special permissions.

Therefore, considering the nature of the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method and its similarity to other APIs with an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level:**
