Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method has two paths with depth 2, but both paths involve iterating over a list of listener records and potentially removing a record. The sink code also involves unlinking a binder and removing a record from the list.

The similar APIs, `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` and `removeHotplugEventListener`, have similar code structures and access control levels of `NONE`. These APIs also involve iterating over lists of listener records and potentially removing records.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality between these APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
