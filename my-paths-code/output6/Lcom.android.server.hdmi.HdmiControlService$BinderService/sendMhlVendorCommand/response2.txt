To determine the access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the nature of the operations performed by these methods.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The `sendMhlVendorCommand` method has high similarity scores with `setSystemAudioVolume` (0.9819787740707397) and `sendVendorCommand` (0.9814647436141968). Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

2. **Operation Nature**: The operations involved in all three methods seem to be related to controlling or sending commands through the HDMI service, which suggests they are interacting with system services that might not require high-level permissions for their basic functionality.

3. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21` and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`. This pattern is similar to what's observed in the provided similar APIs, where they also create instances of different classes (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$12` for `setSystemAudioVolume` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15` for `sendVendorCommand`) and execute them on the service thread.
   - The use of `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();` suggests that the method is setting the work source UID to the calling UID, which might be a way to attribute the work done by this service call to the app making the request. This doesn't inherently suggest a need for elevated permissions but does indicate interaction with system-level services.

Given these points:
- The high similarity scores and similar access control levels (`NONE`) of the comparable APIs.
- The nature of the operation, which seems to be related to controlling HDMI services without an obvious need for sensitive or dangerous permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the analysis above, it's reasonable to conclude that the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method should have a similar access control level as its highly similar counterparts.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
