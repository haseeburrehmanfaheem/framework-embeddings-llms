To assign an access control level to the `getUserCecSettings` API, we must consider its functionality and how it interacts with sensitive data or system resources, comparing it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **API Functionality**: The `getUserCecSettings` method retrieves user settings related to HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) from an `HdmiCecConfig` object. This involves getting a list of user settings without any modification or sensitive data exposure based on the provided code snippet.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **getAllowedCecSettingStringValues**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it does not pose a significant risk regarding privacy, security, or system integrity. It retrieves allowed string values for a specific CEC setting.
   - **shouldHandleTvPowerKey**: Also with an access control level of `NONE`, this method checks if the TV power key should be handled based on CEC settings.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the nature of `getUserCecSettings`, which retrieves existing user settings without altering them or accessing highly sensitive information, it suggests a low-risk operation.
   - The method does not seem to handle dangerous operations like changing system settings, accessing sensitive user data, or performing actions that could compromise system security or integrity.

**Conclusion**: Based on the functionality of `getUserCecSettings` and its similarity with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also does not require a high level of access control. It primarily involves reading existing settings without any apparent risk to system security, user privacy, or integrity.
