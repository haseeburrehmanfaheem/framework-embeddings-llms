To determine the access control level for the `addHotplugEventListener` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The similar API `addDeviceEventListener` has an access control level of `NONE`. Its code snippet shows the creation of a listener record, linking the death of the binder to this record, and adding it to a list of records.
   - Another similar API, `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`, also has an access control level of `NONE`. Although its code snippet is slightly different, focusing on creating a different type of listener record.

2. **Code Snippets for `addHotplugEventListener`:**
   - All paths (1, 2, and 3) involve setting the work source UID to the calling UID, creating a `HdmiControlService$HotplugEventListenerRecord`, getting the binder from the passed listener (`p2`), and in paths 2 and 3, linking this binder's death to the created record.
   - Path 3 further adds the record to `mHotplugEventListenerRecords` and runs a service thread with additional operations involving the listener.

3. **Sink Code:**
   - The sink code involves creating a `HdmiControlService$HotplugEventListenerRecord`, linking the binder's death to this record, adding it to records list, and running a service thread with an instance of `HdmiControlService$11`.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that their operations are considered safe or do not pose significant risks in terms of data privacy or system integrity.
   - The code for `addHotplugEventListener` involves listener registration and potentially some internal service management, which seems to align with the operations performed by the similar APIs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the similarity in functionality between `addHotplugEventListener` and the provided APIs (`addDeviceEventListener` and `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`), and considering their access control levels are `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `addHotplugEventListener` should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarity in functionality and the access control levels assigned to comparable APIs, indicating that the method does not require elevated permissions or pose significant security risks.
