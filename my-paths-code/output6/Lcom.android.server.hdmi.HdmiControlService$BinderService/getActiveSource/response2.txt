Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getActiveSource` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getActiveSource` method is used to retrieve the active source device information. It interacts with the `HdmiCecLocalDevice` and `HdmiDeviceInfo` classes, which are related to HDMI devices and their information.

The similar APIs provided, `getSystemAudioMode()Z`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with the `HdmiCecLocalDevice` class and seem to be related to retrieving system audio mode information.

Considering the similarities between the `getActiveSource` method and the `getSystemAudioMode()Z` APIs, it appears that they are both used to retrieve information about the current state of the HDMI system. They do not seem to perform any actions that could potentially harm the system or compromise user data.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getActiveSource` method, as it is similar to the `getSystemAudioMode()Z` APIs and does not pose any significant risks.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
