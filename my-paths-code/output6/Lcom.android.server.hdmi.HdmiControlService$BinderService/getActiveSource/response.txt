To analyze the provided code for potential sinks, we'll examine both paths of the `getActiveSource` API. The goal is to identify instructions that collectively contribute to a sink by following the specified positive rules and avoiding negative rules.

### Path 1 Analysis

In Path 1, several key operations are performed:

1. **Method Invocations**: 
   - `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();` (auxiliary operation, not a sink)
   - `this.mHdmiCecNetwork.getLocalDevice(4);` and its variations (these have naming similarity with the API's context but do not directly contribute to a sensitive data flow without further analysis of their return values).
   - `v8.isActiveSource();` (method invocation related to the device state, potentially contributing to a sink if it influences sensitive data flows).

2. **Field Access and Updates**:
   - The code accesses various fields like `this.mHdmiCecNetwork`, `this.logicalAddress`, `this.mActiveSource`, but these are primarily used for auxiliary operations or as part of method invocations.

3. **Object Creation and Data Flows**:
   - A new `HdmiDeviceInfo` object is created through a builder pattern, which involves setting physical address, port ID, vendor ID, and display name.
   - The creation of this object directly relates to the API's purpose and potentially represents sensitive information about connected devices.

Based on these observations, the critical sink in Path 1 seems to be related to the creation and return of `HdmiDeviceInfo`:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiCecLocalDevice v15 = this.mHdmiCecNetwork.getLocalDevice(0);",
        "HdmiCecLocalDeviceTv v14 = v15;",
        "int v18 = v16.getActivePath();",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v26 = new HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder(2,0);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v28 = v26.setPhysicalAddress(v18);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v29 = v28.setPortId(v24);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v30 = v29.setVendorId(0);",
        "StringBuilder v31 = new StringBuilder();",
        "StringBuilder v33 = v31.append(\"HDMI\");",
        "StringBuilder v34 = v33.append(v24);",
        "String v35 = v34.toString();",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v36 = v30.setDisplayName(v35);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo v37 = v36.build();"
    ]
]
}
```

### Path 2 Analysis

Path 2 shares similarities with Path 1 but diverges in how the `HdmiDeviceInfo` object is constructed:

1. **Method Invocations**:
   - Similar to Path 1, it involves `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` and getting local devices.
   - Notably, `physicalAddressToPortId(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress)` is used, which directly influences the created `HdmiDeviceInfo`.

2. **Field Access and Updates**:
   - Accesses fields like `this.mHdmiCecNetwork`, `this.logicalAddress`, and `this.mActiveSource` but again primarily for auxiliary or method invocation purposes.

3. **Object Creation and Data Flows**:
   - Creates a new `HdmiDeviceInfo` object, setting its physical address, port ID, vendor ID, and display name based on different inputs than Path 1.
   - This creation directly relates to the API's purpose and potentially represents sensitive device information.

The critical sink in Path 2 is also related to creating and returning `HdmiDeviceInfo`, but with different specifics:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "int v18 = this.mHdmiCecNetwork.physicalAddressToPortId(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v20 = new HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder(2,0);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v22 = v20.setPhysicalAddress(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v23 = v22.setPortId(v17);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v24 = v23.setVendorId(0);",
        "StringBuilder v25 = new StringBuilder();",
        "StringBuilder v27 = v25.append(\"HDMI\");",
        "StringBuilder v28 = v27.append(v17);",
        "String v29 = v28.toString();",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v30 = v24.setDisplayName(v29);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo v31 = v30.build();"
    ]
]
}
```

### Combined Sinks

Given that both paths involve the creation and return of `HdmiDeviceInfo` objects with potentially sensitive information, these represent the primary sinks. The difference lies in how the object's properties are set based on different conditions:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiCecLocalDevice v15 = this.mHdmiCecNetwork.getLocalDevice(0);",
        "HdmiCecLocalDeviceTv v14 = v15;",
        "int v18 = v16.getActivePath();",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v26 = new HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder(2,0);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v28 = v26.setPhysicalAddress(v18);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v29 = v28.setPortId(v24);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v30 = v29.setVendorId(0);",
        "StringBuilder v31 = new StringBuilder();",
        "StringBuilder v33 = v31.append(\"HDMI\");",
        "StringBuilder v34 = v33.append(v24);",
        "String v35 = v34.toString();",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v36 = v30.setDisplayName(v35);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo v37 = v36.build();"
    ],
    [
        "int v18 = this.mHdmiCecNetwork.physicalAddressToPortId(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v20 = new HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder(2,0);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v22 = v20.setPhysicalAddress(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v23 = v22.setPortId(v17);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v24 = v23.setVendorId(0);",
        "StringBuilder v25 = new StringBuilder();",
        "StringBuilder v27 = v25.append(\"HDMI\");",
        "StringBuilder v28 = v27.append(v17);",
        "String v29 = v28.toString();",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v30 = v24.setDisplayName(v29);",
        "HdmiDeviceInfo v31 = v30.build();"
    ]
]
}
```

These sinks are ranked based on their sensitivity, with both being equally sensitive as they involve the creation and return of potentially sensitive device information.
