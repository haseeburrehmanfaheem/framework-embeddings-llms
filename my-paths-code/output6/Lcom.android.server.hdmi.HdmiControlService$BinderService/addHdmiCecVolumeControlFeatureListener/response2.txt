Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The method `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` interacts with the `HdmiControlService` and registers a listener for HDMI CEC volume control feature events. The sink code snippet shows that it sets the work source UID to the calling UID, registers the listener, creates a new runnable, and posts it to the handler.

The similar APIs, `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` and `powerOffRemoteDevice`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with the `HdmiControlService` and perform operations related to HDMI CEC features. The code snippets for these methods show similarities with the `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method, such as setting the work source UID to the calling UID and performing operations on the service thread.

Given the similarities between these methods and their access control levels, it can be inferred that the `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method does not require any specific permissions or access controls beyond what is already handled by the `HdmiControlService`. Therefore, the appropriate access control level for this method would be `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
