Based on the provided code, here is the JSON output identifying potential sinks:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "HdmiControlService$BinderService$1 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$1(p0,p2,p1);",
            "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

In this API, `deviceSelect`, there are two potential sink instructions. 

The creation of a new object `HdmiControlService$BinderService$1` follows the positive rule for object creation with dataflow from API parameters (`p0`, `p2`, and `p1`). This new object is then used in another instruction, `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`, which further propagates the influence of the input parameters. 

The method invocation `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` does not directly contribute to a sink as it doesn't take any API parameters or return values that are used in conjunction with other potential sinks, thus following one of the negative rules (auxiliary operations).

Therefore, the instructions related to the creation and usage of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$1` form a coherent set of instructions that together represent a potential sink.
