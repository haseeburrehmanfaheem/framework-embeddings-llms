Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `setCecSettingIntValue` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setCecSettingIntValue` method has two paths with depth 2, both of which interact with the same sinks:

1. `this.mStorageAdapter.storeSharedPref(v43, v40);`
2. `this.mStorageAdapter.storeGlobalSetting(v43, v40);`

These sinks are related to storing settings in shared preferences or global settings.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. Upon examining their code, we can see that they also interact with the same sinks:

1. `this.mStorageAdapter.storeGlobalSetting(v41, p2);`
2. `this.mStorageAdapter.storeSharedPref(v41, p2);`

Given the similarity in code and sinks between the `setCecSettingIntValue` method and its similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for `setCecSettingIntValue` should also be `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the fact that the `setCecSettingIntValue` method and its similar APIs have similar code patterns and interact with the same sinks, which are related to storing settings. The similarity in access control levels between these APIs suggests that `setCecSettingIntValue` should also have an access control level of `NONE`.
