To assign an access control level to the `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method is used to add a listener for HDMI control status changes. It creates a new `HdmiControlService$HdmiControlStatusChangeListenerRecord` object and adds it to the list of listener records. The method also links the listener to death using `IBinder.linkToDeath` and posts a runnable to the handler.

The similar APIs provided are `addHotplugEventListener` and `setInputChangeListener`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also add listeners for specific events, but they do not seem to perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions.

Comparing the code snippets of these APIs, we can see that they all follow a similar pattern:

1. Create a new record object to store the listener.
2. Add the record object to a list or set of listeners.
3. Perform some additional setup, such as linking to death or posting a runnable.

The `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method does not seem to perform any operations that would require elevated permissions or access control levels beyond what is typical for listener registration methods.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method should have an access control level of `NONE`, as it does not pose any significant security risks and its functionality is similar to other APIs with the same access control level.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
