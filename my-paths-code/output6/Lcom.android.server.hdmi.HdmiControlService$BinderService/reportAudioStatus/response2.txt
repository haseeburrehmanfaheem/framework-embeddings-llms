To assign an access control level to the `reportAudioStatus` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs. 

The `reportAudioStatus` method has a similarity score of 0.990506649017334 with the `startOneTouchRecord` API and 0.9891722202301025 with the `setStandbyMode` API. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. 

Upon examining the code snippets, we can see that all three methods follow a similar pattern:
1. They create a new instance of a class (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$23`, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$17`, and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$22` respectively) and pass parameters to it.
2. They call the `runOnServiceThread` method on `this.this$0` (which refers to the outer class instance), passing the newly created object as an argument.

Given this similarity in structure and functionality, and considering that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, we can infer that the `reportAudioStatus` method likely does not require any special permissions or access controls. 

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, the final access control level for the `reportAudioStatus` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
