To determine the access control level for the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**:
   - `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It adds a listener to receive HDMI control status change events.
   - `removeCecSettingChangeListener`: This API also has an access control level of `NONE`. It removes a listener that was previously registered to receive changes in CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) settings.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The code snippet for `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` shows it removing a specific type of listener (`IHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`) from the HDMI control service.
   - It calls `this.this$0.removeHdmiControlVolumeControlStatusChangeListener(p1);`, indicating that it is interacting with internal components related to volume control and status change listeners.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs (`addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` and `removeCecSettingChangeListener`) have an access control level of `NONE`, we can infer that the operations of adding or removing listeners, in general, do not require elevated permissions.
   - The operation performed by `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` is also related to listener management (specifically removal), which does not typically require sensitive permissions or pose significant security risks.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the access control level for `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` should be consistent with the similar APIs provided, which do not require special permissions beyond normal application operation.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
