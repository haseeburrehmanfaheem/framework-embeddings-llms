To assign an access control level to the `clearTimerRecording` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `clearTimerRecording` method has a similarity score of over 0.99 with two other APIs: `setSystemAudioVolume` and `powerOnRemoteDevice`. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Looking at the code snippets, we can see that all three methods follow a similar pattern:

1. They create a new instance of a class (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$XX`) with parameters.
2. They call the `runOnServiceThread` method on `this.this$0`, passing the newly created instance as an argument.

The sink code for `clearTimerRecording` also shows a similar pattern to the other two APIs, which further supports the idea that they are related and should have similar access control levels.

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `clearTimerRecording` method should have the same access control level as its similar APIs, which is `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
