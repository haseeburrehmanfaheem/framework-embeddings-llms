Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method has three paths with depth 2, all of which involve creating a new `HdmiControlService$SystemAudioModeChangeListenerRecord` object and linking it to the death of an `IBinder` object. The method also adds the record to a list of listener records.

The similar APIs, `addDeviceEventListener` and `addHotplugEventListener`, have similar code structures and are assigned an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also create a new record object, link it to the death of an `IBinder` object, and add it to a list of listener records.

Given the similarities between these APIs, it is likely that the `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method should have the same access control level as the similar APIs. Since the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to assign the same level to the `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
