After analyzing the provided code paths for the API `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues`, I have identified potential sinks based on the given rules. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "List v17 = this.mAllowedValues;",
            "Iterator v18 = v17.iterator();",
            "boolean v19 = v18.hasNext();",
            "if (v19 == 0) {",
            "ArrayList v15 = new ArrayList();",
            "List v7 = v15;",
            "Stream v20 = v7.stream();",
            "HdmiControlService$BinderService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0 v21 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0();",
            "IntStream v23 = v20.mapToInt(v21);",
            "[I v24 = v23.toArray();",
            "return v24;"
        ],
        [
            "HdmiCecConfig v6 = this.this$0.getHdmiCecConfig();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

However, upon closer inspection and considering the rules provided, it seems that not all instructions directly contribute to a sensitive data flow or access control decision. The first set of instructions is more relevant as they involve processing and returning potentially sensitive values from `this.mAllowedValues`. 

The second identified instruction, while accessing an internal field (`HdmiCecConfig`), does not seem to be directly used in a way that would make it a significant sink based on the provided rules. It's more of an auxiliary operation for obtaining an instance or context object.

Given this analysis and focusing strictly on the instructions that contribute to potential sinks with clear data flow links, the refined JSON output is:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "List v17 = this.mAllowedValues;",
            "Iterator v18 = v17.iterator();",
            "boolean v19 = v18.hasNext();",
            "if (v19 == 0) {",
            "ArrayList v15 = new ArrayList();",
            "List v7 = v15;",
            "Stream v20 = v7.stream();",
            "HdmiControlService$BinderService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0 v21 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0();",
            "IntStream v23 = v20.mapToInt(v21);",
            "[I v24 = v23.toArray();",
            "return v24;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This set of instructions directly relates to the processing and return of sensitive data (`this.mAllowedValues`), which is then used to create an array that's returned by the API, thus following at least one of the positive rules for identifying potential sinks.
