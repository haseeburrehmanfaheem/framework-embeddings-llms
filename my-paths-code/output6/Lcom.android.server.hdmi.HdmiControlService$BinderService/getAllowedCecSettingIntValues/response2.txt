To determine the access control level for the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves checking settings, iterating over allowed values, and returning an array of integers based on those values. It interacts with `HdmiCecConfig`, `HdmiControlService`, and uses `Binder` for identity management.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet shows iteration over a list (`mAllowedValues`) and conversion to an integer array, which suggests data processing rather than sensitive operation execution.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues`: This method has a high similarity score with the target method but operates on string values instead of integers. It's assigned an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it doesn't pose significant security risks or require special permissions to execute.

Considering these points:

- The operations within `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` seem to be focused on data retrieval and processing, similar to `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues`.
- There's no indication of performing sensitive actions (like modifying system settings, accessing user data without permission, or executing dangerous operations) that would necessitate higher access control levels (`NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`).
- The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` suggests interaction with system services but in a manner that's more about identity management than executing privileged operations.

Given the similarities with `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` (which has an access control level of `NONE`) and the nature of its operations, it seems reasonable to conclude that `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` does not require elevated permissions or pose significant security risks. Thus, its access control level should align with that of similar, non-sensitive methods.

**Final Access Control Level:**
