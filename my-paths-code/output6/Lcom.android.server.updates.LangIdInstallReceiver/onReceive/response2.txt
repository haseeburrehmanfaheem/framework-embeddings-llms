To assign an access control level to the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The code snippet for `onReceive` is:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
The sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Both the code snippet and sink code create an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and start it.

Now, let's look at the similar APIs:

* API Name: `onReceive(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/content/Intent;)V` with Similarity Score: 1.0
	+ Access Control Level: NONE
	+ Code:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
* API Name: `onReceive(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/content/Intent;)V` with Similarity Score: 1.0
	+ Access Control Level: NONE
	+ Code:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Both similar APIs have the same code and are assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the `onReceive` method is creating an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and starting it, which is a common pattern among the similar APIs. Since all similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it's likely that the `onReceive` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
```json
{
    "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
