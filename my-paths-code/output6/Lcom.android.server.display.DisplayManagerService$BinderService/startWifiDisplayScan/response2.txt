To determine the access control level for the `startWifiDisplayScan` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `startWifiDisplayScan` method involves getting a callback from `this.mCallbacks.get(p2)` and then calling `DisplayManagerService.startWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)`. This suggests interaction with system-level services related to display management, which could potentially require specific permissions or access control due to the sensitive nature of managing display settings.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves retrieving a callback (`Object v7 = this.mCallbacks.get(p2);`) and then starting a Wi-Fi display scan using `DisplayManagerService.startWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)`. This operation affects system resources and settings, indicating that it might not be suitable for all applications to perform without restriction.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **stopWifiDisplayScan()V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9674162864685059) with `startWifiDisplayScan` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippet for `stopWifiDisplayScan` also interacts with system-level display services (`DisplayManagerService.stopWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)`), similar to `startWifiDisplayScan`. Given the high similarity, it's reasonable to consider that both methods might require similar access control levels due to their related functionality in managing Wi-Fi display settings.
   - **startScan(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)V**: This API has a lower similarity score (0.7517805695533752) compared to `stopWifiDisplayScan` and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Although it involves scanning, the context seems different (media router manager), which might not directly relate to system display settings management.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**: Given the high similarity with `stopWifiDisplayScan`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering that both methods deal with sensitive system operations related to Wi-Fi display settings, it's logical to assign a similar access control level to `startWifiDisplayScan`. The interaction with system-level services (`DisplayManagerService`) also supports the need for restricted access.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and especially the high similarity with `stopWifiDisplayScan`, which also deals with system display settings and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that `startWifiDisplayScan` should have a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
