To assign an access control level to the `getDefaultBrightnessConfiguration` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `getDefaultBrightnessConfiguration` returns a `BrightnessConfiguration` object.
   - It checks if `mAutomaticBrightnessController` is not null and then retrieves the default brightness configuration from it.
   - If `mAutomaticBrightnessController` is null, the method does not explicitly handle this case in the provided snippet, but based on the context, it seems to rely on the `mInteractiveModeBrightnessMapper` for getting a default configuration.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves getting the default brightness configuration from `mInteractiveModeBrightnessMapper`.
   - This suggests that the method interacts with system components related to display and brightness settings.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getBrightnessConfigurationForUser`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These methods also deal with retrieving brightness configurations, either for a specific user or with fallback mechanisms.
   - Their similarity scores indicate that they share significant functionality with the method in question.

Given this analysis, we can infer the following:

- The `getDefaultBrightnessConfiguration` method interacts with system-level components (like `DisplayManagerService`, `mAutomaticBrightnessController`, and `mInteractiveModeBrightnessMapper`) which are typically protected by higher access control levels due to their sensitivity.
- The similarity in functionality with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that this method may also require a similar level of protection.

Considering the interaction with system components and the similarities with other APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getDefaultBrightnessConfiguration` method should be assigned an access control level that reflects its potential impact on system settings and user experience.

**Access Control Level Assignment**:

Given the information and analysis above, the final access control level for the `getDefaultBrightnessConfiguration` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment aligns with the protection levels of similar APIs that interact with system brightness settings and acknowledges the method's potential to affect system behavior.
