To determine the access control level for the `stopWifiDisplayScan` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and the provided similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `stopWifiDisplayScan` method involves getting the calling process ID using `Binder.getCallingPid()`, clearing the calling identity with `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`, and then retrieving an object from `this.mCallbacks` based on a parameter `p2`.
   - It checks if the retrieved object (`v7`) is null. If not, it calls `DisplayManagerService.stopWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)` and then restores the calling identity.
   - The method interacts with system-level services (display management) which suggests it might require specific permissions or access control.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves getting an object from `this.mCallbacks` and passing it to `DisplayManagerService.stopWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)`.
   - This interaction with a display service implies that the method affects system-level functionality, potentially requiring controlled access.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **startWifiDisplayScan()V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9674162864685059) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The similarity in code structure (both involve getting an object from `this.mCallbacks` and interacting with display services) suggests that the access control for `stopWifiDisplayScan` might also be sensitive, potentially requiring system or signature-level permissions.
   - **stopScan(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)V**: This API has a lower similarity score (0.7732478976249695) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Although it's involved in stopping a scan, the context and implementation differ significantly from `stopWifiDisplayScan`, making its access control less relevant for direct comparison.

**Conclusion**:
Given the method's interaction with system-level display services, its similarity to `startWifiDisplayScan` which requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, and considering the potential impact on device functionality, the most appropriate access control level for `stopWifiDisplayScan` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized components or applications with the necessary permissions can initiate a stop WiFi display scan operation.
