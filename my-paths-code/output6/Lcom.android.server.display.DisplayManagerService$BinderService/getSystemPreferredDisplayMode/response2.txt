To assign an access control level to the `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` method, we need to consider its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The two similar APIs provided are `getUserPreferredDisplayMode`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`.

The code snippets for all these methods follow a similar pattern:
1. They call `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` to clear the calling identity, which is a mechanism used in Android to temporarily clear the identity of the caller (e.g., the UID and PID), allowing a method to execute with less restriction but still keeping track of the original caller for later restoration.
2. They use `this.mLogicalDisplayMapper.getDisplayLocked(p1)` to get a `LogicalDisplay` based on an input parameter `p1`.
3. Depending on whether the `LogicalDisplay` or its associated `DisplayDevice` is not null, they proceed to call either `getSystemPreferredDisplayModeLocked()` or `getUserPreferredDisplayModeLocked()` on the `DisplayDevice`, which implies interaction with display settings.
4. They restore the calling identity using `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)` before returning a `Display$Mode`.

The key difference between `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` and `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` lies in their names and the method called on `DisplayDevice`: `getSystemPreferredDisplayModeLocked()` vs `getUserPreferredDisplayModeLocked()`. However, both are related to retrieving display mode preferences.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that these operations are not considered sensitive or do not pose a significant risk in terms of accessing user data or system resources without proper authorization. The fact that they all clear and restore the calling identity also points towards an operation that is intended to be executed without specific permissions, as it temporarily suspends the normal permission checking mechanism for the duration of the call.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels, along with the operational semantics of `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode`, we conclude that its access control level should also be `NONE`.
