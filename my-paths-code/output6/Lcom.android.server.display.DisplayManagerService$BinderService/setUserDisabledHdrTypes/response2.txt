To determine the access control level for the `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method appears to be responsible for setting the types of HDR (High Dynamic Range) formats that a user has disabled on their device. It takes an array of integers representing these formats and updates the settings accordingly, including storing this preference in system settings.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z`: This method checks if the feature to disable HDR types is allowed for the user. Its access control level is `NONE`, indicating it doesn't pose a significant risk or require specific permissions to execute.
   - `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V`: This method sets whether the feature of disabling HDR types by users is allowed. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that only system applications or applications with a specific signature can modify this setting, likely due to its potential impact on device functionality and settings.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method modifies user preferences related to HDR formats. This action involves updating system settings (`Settings$Global.putString`) and potentially affects how the display operates.
   - Given that it directly impacts system settings, there's a potential for misuse if any application could change these settings without restriction. However, since it's related to user preferences rather than low-level system operations or sensitive data, the risk might be considered moderate.
   - The method does check if the provided HDR types are valid (`DisplayManagerService.isSubsetOf`) and ensures they are properly sorted before applying changes, indicating a level of control over the input.

4. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Considering the `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access to enable or disable the feature, it implies that modifications related to HDR preferences should be handled with care.
   - However, since `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` deals directly with user preferences rather than system-critical settings, and given its similarity in functionality but less critical impact compared to enabling/disabling the feature altogether, it's reasonable to consider an access control level that balances between security and usability.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Given the analysis above and considering the balance between the method's functionality, potential risks, and the need for controlled access to system settings, a suitable access control level for `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` would be `NORMAL`. This reflects the method's moderate risk profile and the need for some level of restriction while still allowing authorized applications to modify user preferences related to HDR formats.
