To determine the access control level for the `connectWifiDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `connectWifiDisplay` method involves checking if `mWifiDisplayAdapter` is null (or 0 in this context), and if so, it calls `requestConnectLocked(p2)` on the adapter after clearing and then restoring the calling identity. This implies an interaction with a system-level component (`WifiDisplayAdapter`) that requires permission or specific access rights.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet shows a conditional check for `mWifiDisplayAdapter` being null, followed by a call to `requestConnectLocked(p1)`. This further emphasizes the method's dependency on system-level components and their states.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **disconnectWifiDisplay()V**: With a similarity score of 0.8883257508277893, this API has an access control level of NONE. Its code structure is similar to `connectWifiDisplay`, but the operation (disconnection) might not require elevated permissions.
   - **resumeWifiDisplay()V**: Having a similarity score of 0.8301310539245605, its access control level is SYS_OR_SIG. This suggests that resuming a WiFi display involves system-level or signature-protected operations.

Given these points:
- The method interacts with system components (`WifiDisplayAdapter`).
- Similar APIs have varying access control levels based on their operations.
- `connectWifiDisplay` involves connecting to a WiFi display, which is a system-level operation potentially requiring specific permissions or access rights.

Considering the SYS_OR_SIG access control level for `resumeWifiDisplay()` and the operational similarity between these methods (all interact with `mWifiDisplayAdapter`), it's reasonable to deduce that `connectWifiDisplay` would also require a higher level of access control due to its system-level interaction. However, without explicit indication that it strictly requires signature or system-level permissions (like `resumeWifiDisplay()` does), we should consider the context and implications of connecting a WiFi display.

The final decision hinges on understanding that connecting a WiFi display might not be as sensitive an operation as resuming one but still involves system-level components. Given the absence of explicit permission checks in the provided code snippet, and considering the similarities with other APIs, especially `resumeWifiDisplay()` which has a SYS_OR_SIG level, it's plausible to consider a moderate to high access control level for `connectWifiDisplay`. However, without clear evidence that it requires signature-level protection or is exclusively system-internal (SYS_OR_SIG), we lean towards an assignment based on its operational needs and the context provided by similar APIs.

Therefore, considering all factors, including the need for interaction with system components but lacking explicit indicators of requiring SYS_OR_SIG access control level like `resumeWifiDisplay()`, a balanced approach would suggest that `connectWifiDisplay` might not strictly require SYS_OR_SIG access but still involves significant system interaction. Thus, it's logical to assign an access control level reflecting its operational sensitivity and system dependency.

Given the choices (NONE, NORMAL, DANGEROUS, SYS_OR_SIG) and considering the method's nature and the provided context:

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
