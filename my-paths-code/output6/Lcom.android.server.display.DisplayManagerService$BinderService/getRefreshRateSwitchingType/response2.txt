To assign an access control level to the `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The provided code snippet for `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` shows that it retrieves a value from `this.mModeSwitchingType`, stores it in `v2`, and then returns this value after restoring the calling identity. The key operation here is the retrieval of `this.mModeSwitchingType`, which suggests that the method is accessing internal state related to display or graphics mode switching.

The sink code focuses on the assignment and return of `v2` (which equals `v3`), highlighting the core action of retrieving and returning a specific type value (`mModeSwitchingType`).

Given the similar APIs, both `isInLockTaskMode()` and `getLockTaskModeState()`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also involve accessing internal states (`mLockTaskModeState`) and returning values related to lock task mode. The similarity in operation (accessing and returning internal state values) suggests that the nature of these operations does not require elevated permissions or pose significant risks.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality is akin to simply retrieving and returning an internal setting without any apparent risk of data exposure, tampering, or other security concerns that would necessitate higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`, and given the similarity with other methods classified as `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` should also be classified under the same access control level.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
