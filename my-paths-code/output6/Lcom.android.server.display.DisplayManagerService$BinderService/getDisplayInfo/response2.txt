To determine the access control level for the `getDisplayInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs provided are variants of `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode`, both with an access control level of `NONE`.
   - These methods interact with `LogicalDisplay` and its locked methods to retrieve display modes.
   - The similarity in code structure suggests that the access control might be related to how the display information is accessed and used.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves retrieving a `LogicalDisplay`, then getting frame rate overrides, display info, and potentially overriding display info based on frame rate settings.
   - This process involves locked methods, suggesting that synchronization or security measures are in place to protect access to these resources.

3. **Path Analysis for `getDisplayInfo`**:
   - All paths involve checking the calling UID, clearing the calling identity, and then attempting to retrieve display information.
   - The critical part is the check `v8.hasAccess(p3)` followed by `DisplayManagerService.isUidPresentOnDisplayInternal(p3, p2)`, which implies that access control is enforced based on the UID's presence on the display and its ability to access the display info.
   - If either condition fails (no access or UID not present), the method may return null or an empty result, indicating a controlled response based on access rights.

Given these observations:

- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that basic display information retrieval does not require high-level permissions.
- However, `getDisplayInfo` involves additional checks (UID presence and access rights) that are not present in the provided similar APIs. This implies a need for some level of access control to ensure that sensitive or specific display information is only accessible by authorized UIDs.

Considering these points, while the method does perform checks that suggest it needs to manage access, the fact that similar methods have `NONE` as their access control level and the nature of the checks (more about presence on the display rather than system-wide critical operations) suggests that the access control level should not be too restrictive but still acknowledges some form of access management.

Therefore, the most appropriate access control level for `getDisplayInfo`, considering it performs specific checks related to UID and display access but does not deal with system-critical or dangerous operations directly, would be `NORMAL`. This reflects a need for managed access without elevating to `DANGEROUS` or requiring system-level permissions like `SYS_OR_SIG`.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice balances the need for access control with the nature of the operations performed by the method, aligning with Android's permission model that seeks to protect user and system resources while allowing functional interactions.
