To assign an access control level to the `setRefreshRateSwitchingType` method, we need to consider its functionality, the similar APIs provided, and their respective access control levels.

1. **Functionality of `setRefreshRateSwitchingType`:** This method sets the refresh rate switching type based on the input parameter `p1`. It checks if the new type is different from the current mode switching type (`this.mModeSwitchingType`), and if so, it updates `this.mModeSwitchingType` to `p1` and notifies that the desired display mode specs have changed.

2. **Sink Code:** The sink code `['this.mModeSwitchingType = p1;']` indicates that the method directly modifies an internal state variable (`mModeSwitchingType`) based on user input without any validation or transformation of the input. This suggests a potential for external control over internal settings, which might have implications for system behavior or security.

3. **Similar APIs:**
   - **`getRefreshRateSwitchingType()`:** With an access control level of `NONE`, this method simply returns the current refresh rate switching type without modifying any state. The low complexity and read-only nature justify its `NONE` access control level.
   - **`stopAppSwitches():`** This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It stops app switches by setting `mAppSwitchesState` to 0, which implies a more significant impact on system behavior or state. The `SYS_OR_SIG` level suggests that this operation requires either system-level privileges or a signature permission, indicating it's sensitive.

Considering these points:
- **Impact on System State:** `setRefreshRateSwitchingType` modifies internal system settings based directly on external input without validation shown in the provided snippet. This could have implications for how the system operates, particularly regarding display modes.
- **Comparison with Similar APIs:** While `getRefreshRateSwitchingType()` has minimal impact and thus a `NONE` access control level, `stopAppSwitches()` affects system behavior more significantly, warranting a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. The operation of `setRefreshRateSwitchingType` falls somewhere in between; it does modify system settings but doesn't necessarily require the high privilege level implied by `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `setRefreshRateSwitchingType` seems to be `NORMAL`. This is because while it does modify internal state based on external input (which requires some level of access control), it doesn't appear to necessitate system-level privileges or signature permissions as implied by `SYS_OR_SIG`, nor is it as benign as `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice balances the need for some level of protection against unauthorized modifications with the understanding that this method's functionality, while impactful, does not require the highest levels of privilege or signature-based permissions.
