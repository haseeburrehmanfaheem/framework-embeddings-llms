To assign an access control level to the `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves changing a setting ("are_user_disabled_hdr_formats_allowed") using `Settings$Global.putInt`, which suggests that this method is interacting with system settings.
   - It also involves iterating over displays using `this.mLogicalDisplayMapper.forEachLocked(v9)`, indicating an operation that affects display settings.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()` has a similarity score of 0.8581590056419373 and is assigned an access control level of NONE. This method simply returns the value of `mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` without modifying any system settings or performing significant operations.
   - The API `setBrightnessConfigurationForUser` has a similarity score of 0.7766275405883789 and is assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This method involves setting brightness configurations for users, which affects system settings and potentially requires higher privileges.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - **NONE**: Typically used for methods that do not pose a security risk or do not affect the system's behavior significantly.
   - **NORMAL**: Used for methods that may pose some risk but are generally considered safe under normal usage conditions.
   - **DANGEROUS**: Applies to methods that can cause significant harm, leak sensitive data, or compromise the system's integrity if misused.
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: Reserved for operations that require system or signature-level permissions, indicating they have significant impact on the device's functionality or security.

Given this analysis:
- The `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method modifies a system setting ("are_user_disabled_hdr_formats_allowed") and iterates over displays to potentially apply changes. This suggests it could affect how the system operates, specifically in terms of display settings.
- The method does not seem to handle sensitive data or perform operations that would directly compromise system security, but it does interact with system settings.

Considering these points and comparing them with the provided similar APIs:
- `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()` is assigned NONE because it's a read operation without significant impact.
- `setBrightnessConfigurationForUser` is assigned SYS_OR_SIG likely due to its direct influence on system settings that could require higher privileges.

Given that `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` modifies system settings (which implies some level of privilege) but does not seem to pose an immediate or significant security risk like handling sensitive data, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should be assigned a moderate access control level. However, since the choices provided are discrete and considering the impact on system settings (modifying "are_user_disabled_hdr_formats_allowed"), the closest match in terms of requiring some form of privilege but not being directly dangerous or normal would lean towards needing system or signature-level access due to its interaction with system-wide settings.

Thus, considering the method's functionality and its potential to affect system behavior by changing display-related settings at a system level, it seems most appropriate to assign an access control level that reflects its need for system-level permissions without being overly permissive or restrictive.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision balances the method's potential impact on system settings with the need to ensure that such modifications are made with appropriate privileges.
