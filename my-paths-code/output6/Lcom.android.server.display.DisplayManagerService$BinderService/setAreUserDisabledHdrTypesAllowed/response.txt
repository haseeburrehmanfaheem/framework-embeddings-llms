Based on the provided API code for `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`, I've analyzed the potential sinks in each path. Since all paths have identical code, my analysis will focus on one instance of this code.

The positive rules indicate that a sink might be present if there's method invocation, field access/update, object creation, or data flow that follows specific criteria such as naming similarity with the API name, involvement of input parameters, or return values. However, since `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` does not return any value (it's void), we'll focus on other aspects like field updates and method invocations.

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "if (this.mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed != p2) {",
      "this.mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed = p2;",
      "boolean v7 = Settings$Global.putInt(v6, \"are_user_disabled_hdr_formats_allowed\", );"
    ],
    [
      "DisplayManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3 v9 = new DisplayManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3(DisplayManagerService,);",
      "this.mLogicalDisplayMapper.forEachLocked(v9);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
1. The first set of instructions in the `Sinks` array represents a coherent set where the input parameter `p2` (which should be `p1` based on the method signature but seems to be a typo or misrepresentation in the provided code) influences the update of the field `mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`. This field's value is then used to conditionally invoke `Settings$Global.putInt`, which modifies system settings. The data flow from the input parameter to the modification of system settings indicates this as a potential sink.

2. The second set involves the creation of an object `DisplayManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3` and its use with `this.mLogicalDisplayMapper.forEachLocked(v9)`. This might seem like a candidate, but without explicit involvement of input parameters or return values that directly influence system state in a sensitive manner (beyond what's shown), it ranks lower in sensitivity compared to the modification of system settings based on user input.

Given the context and focusing strictly on the provided positive and negative rules, the ranking prioritizes direct modifications of system state influenced by input parameters. However, note that `p1` is not used within the method body as expected from its declaration; instead, `p2` is referenced, suggesting a potential error or omission in the code snippet provided for analysis.
