To determine the access control level for the `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` method takes an integer parameter `p1` and returns a `Display$Mode` object. It interacts with display settings, specifically aiming to retrieve the user-preferred display mode for a given display identifier.

2. **Code Paths**: There are two paths provided for this API, both involving the retrieval of a `LogicalDisplay` object based on the input parameter `p1`, and then attempting to get a `DisplayDevice` object from it. The critical part is the call to `getUserPreferredDisplayModeLocked()` on the `DisplayDevice` object, which suggests an interaction with user preferences regarding display modes.

3. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets highlight the key parts of the method's logic, focusing on the retrieval of `LogicalDisplay` and `DisplayDevice` objects and the subsequent call to get the user-preferred display mode.

4. **Similar APIs**: Two similar APIs are provided, both named `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode`, with high similarity scores (0.9836874604225159 and 0.9705453515052795). These methods also deal with display modes but focus on system preferences rather than user preferences. Notably, both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given this information, the key factors to consider for assigning an access control level are:

- **Similarity to Other APIs**: The high similarity scores with `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` APIs suggest that `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` might not require stringent access controls since its similar counterparts have `NONE`.
- **Functionality and Potential Impact**: The method interacts with user preferences for display modes, which is a relatively benign operation compared to operations that could compromise system security or privacy. This suggests that the method may not need high-level access control.

Based on these considerations, it seems reasonable to conclude that the `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` method does not require high levels of access control, given its functionality and the precedent set by similar APIs with `NONE` access control levels.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision reflects the method's relatively non-sensitive nature and its similarity to other methods that do not have restrictive access controls.
