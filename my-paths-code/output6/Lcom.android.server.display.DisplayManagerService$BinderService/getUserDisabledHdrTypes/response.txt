Here's the analysis of the provided code:

The API `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` returns an array `v1` which is assigned the value of `this.mUserDisabledHdrTypes`. 

According to the positive rules, a field get case can be considered a sink if it has naming similarity with the API name. In this case, `mUserDisabledHdrTypes` has a naming similarity with `getUserDisabledHdrTypes`.

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "[I v1 = this.mUserDisabledHdrTypes;",
        "return v1;"
    ]
]
}
