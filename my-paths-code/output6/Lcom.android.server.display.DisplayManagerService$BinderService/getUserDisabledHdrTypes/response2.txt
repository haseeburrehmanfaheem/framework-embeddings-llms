To determine the access control level for the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method simply returns an array of integers (`[I`) stored in the object's field `mUserDisabledHdrTypes`. This operation does not modify any system settings or sensitive data; it only retrieves existing information.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z** with a similarity score of 0.87247633934021 and an access control level of NONE:
     - This method returns a boolean value indicating whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed. The operation is read-only and does not affect system settings or sensitive data directly, which aligns with the NONE access control level.
   - **setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V** with a similarity score of 0.732030987739563 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG:
     - This method sets whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed and updates system settings accordingly. The operation modifies system settings, which requires a higher access control level, SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that it should be accessible to system or signature applications.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method's nature as a read-only operation that retrieves existing settings without modifying any sensitive data or system settings, its behavior aligns more closely with **areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z**, which has an access control level of NONE.
   - Since `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` does not modify system settings or handle sensitive information beyond what's already accessible through similar methods with the NONE access control level, it does not necessitate the higher SYS_OR_SIG access control level.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method should have an access control level of **NONE**, as it performs a read operation without altering system settings or accessing sensitive information beyond what's permissible under this level.
