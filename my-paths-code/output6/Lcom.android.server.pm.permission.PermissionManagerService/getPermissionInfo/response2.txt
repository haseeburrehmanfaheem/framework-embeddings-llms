To assign an access control level to the `getPermissionInfo` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `getSplitPermissions()Ljava/util/List;` with a Similarity Score of 1.0 and an Access Control Level of `NONE`.
2. `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions(Ljava/lang/String;II)Ljava/util/List;` with a Similarity Score of 1.0 and an Access Control Level of `NONE`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not pose significant security risks or require special permissions to execute.

Given the high similarity score (1.0) between these APIs and the `getPermissionInfo` method, it is reasonable to infer that the `getPermissionInfo` method also does not require elevated permissions or pose significant security risks. The method's purpose appears to be retrieving information about a permission, which aligns with the behavior of the similar APIs provided.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the access control levels of the provided APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `getPermissionInfo` method is `NONE`.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
