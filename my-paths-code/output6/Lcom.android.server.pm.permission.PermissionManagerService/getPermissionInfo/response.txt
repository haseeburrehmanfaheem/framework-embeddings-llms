Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public PermissionInfo getPermissionInfo(String p1, String p2, int p3){
    return v1;
}
```

Since `v1` is not defined within this method and does not directly relate to the input parameters (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) or have a naming similarity with `getPermissionInfo`, we need more context about where `v1` comes from. However, assuming `v1` is a field or variable that somehow relates to the permission info being requested (which could be determined by external methods not shown here), it's still crucial to assess its connection to potential sinks based on the given rules.

Given the lack of information about how `v1` is generated or if it directly involves any sensitive data flow from `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`, and considering that this method invocation itself does not explicitly show a direct link to any sink without additional context, we can't accurately identify a coherent set of instructions contributing to a sink based solely on the provided snippet.

However, if we were to consider `v1` as being influenced by or related to the permission info (possibly through methods not shown), then the return statement could be seen as part of a potential sink. But without explicit evidence of this within the given code, it's challenging to definitively categorize it under the provided rules.

For the sake of analysis based on what is directly provided and adhering strictly to the format requested:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "return v1;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This response acknowledges that without more context, `v1`'s relationship to potential sinks remains speculative. If additional code or context were available, a more detailed analysis could potentially reveal more direct connections between the method's parameters and any identified sinks.
