Since the provided method `grantRuntimePermission` does not perform any operations that follow the positive rules (i.e., it doesn't invoke methods with naming similarity to the API name, access or modify fields with naming similarity to the API name, create new objects with dataflow from the API parameters), and its only instruction is a return statement which doesn't contribute to any potential sink, we conclude there are no sinks in this method.

Here's the JSON representation of the analysis result:

```json
{
