To assign an access control level to the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method has a similarity score of 0.9997791051864624 with the `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippets of these two methods are almost identical, with the only difference being the value passed to the `PermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` constructor (2 vs 1). This suggests that they are likely to be handling similar sensitive information and require the same level of access control.

On the other hand, the `findNanoAppOnHub` API has a lower similarity score of 0.7683694362640381 and an access control level of `NONE`. Although this method also iterates over a list of packages/applications, its code snippet is less similar to `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages`, and it does not seem to handle the same type of sensitive information.

Considering the high similarity between `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` and `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages`, it is likely that they require the same level of access control. Therefore, based on the provided information, the final access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment is primarily due to the high similarity with another API that has been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggesting that both methods handle sensitive information that requires system or signature-level permission to access.
