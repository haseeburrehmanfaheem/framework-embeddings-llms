To determine the access control level for the `queryPermissionsByGroup` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Behavior Analysis**: The `queryPermissionsByGroup` method returns a `ParceledListSlice`, which is used to carry permissions by group. The method's logic seems straightforward: if a certain condition (`v1 != 0`) is met, it creates and returns a new `ParceledListSlice` with the data `v1`. If not, it returns `0`, which could be interpreted as an empty or null result.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The API `getAllPermissionGroups(I)Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` has a very high similarity score (0.9941756725311279) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This method also returns a `ParceledListSlice`, suggesting that the data it handles does not require stringent access controls.
   - The API `getCurrentRules()Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` has a similarity score of 0.9496293663978577 and is also assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It returns an empty `ParceledListSlice`, which implies that the method's operation does not pose significant security risks.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   Given the similarities in behavior and purpose between `queryPermissionsByGroup` and the provided APIs, it appears that `queryPermissionsByGroup` is primarily concerned with retrieving and returning permission-related data without performing actions that could compromise system security or user privacy directly.
   
   The fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` suggests that handling permissions in this manner does not require elevated permissions. Therefore, based on the provided information and the behavior of the method, it seems reasonable to conclude that `queryPermissionsByGroup` should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level**:
