Since this method does not follow any of the positive rules (no naming similarity with the API name, no input parameters used as arguments in a meaningful way, no return value, and no object creation), it is unlikely to be considered a sink.

However, since there's an invocation of `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` which takes an argument `p1`, we could argue that this method might have some relation with permissions. But due to the lack of any concrete operation (the method simply returns without doing anything), and considering the negative rules (it does not fall into generic utility methods, logging methods, or auxiliary operations as it's empty), there is no coherent set of instructions to form a potential sink.

Given this analysis, the JSON response would be:

```json
{
"Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that there are no identified sinks in the provided code snippet.
