To determine the access control level for the `setAutoRevokeExempted` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The method interacts with sensitive operations such as package management and app ops, which are typically protected by specific access controls.

1. **Analysis of `setAutoRevokeExempted` Method:**
   - The method checks if the caller is the installer of record for the given package (`this.mPackageManagerInt.isCallerInstallerOfRecord(v2, v3)`), indicating a need for certain privileges.
   - It performs an AppOps check (`this.mAppOpsManager.checkOpNoThrow(98, v9, v10)`) which suggests that it deals with operations that require permission or have specific access control levels applied.
   - The method modifies the app ops mode (`this.mAppOpsManager.setMode(97, v9, v13, )`), which is a sensitive operation that typically requires elevated privileges.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - `isAutoRevokeExempted(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with package management (`this.mPackageManagerInt.getPackage(p1)`) and checks app ops (`this.mAppOpsManager.checkOpNoThrow(97, v9, p1)`), similar to `setAutoRevokeExempted`.
   - `checkPhoneNumberAccess(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;II)I` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although it deals with different aspects of package and user management, the involvement of getting application info (`v4.getApplicationInfoAsUser(p1, 0, v5)`) suggests a need for system or signature-level permissions.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system-level privileges or signature-level permissions to execute.
- The operations performed by `setAutoRevokeExempted` (checking and modifying app ops, verifying the caller's relationship with the package) are sensitive and typically require elevated access controls.

**Conclusion:**
The `setAutoRevokeExempted` method involves sensitive operations related to package management and app permissions. Considering its similarity in functionality and security requirements to the provided APIs (`isAutoRevokeExempted` and `checkPhoneNumberAccess`), which both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that `setAutoRevokeExempted` should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `setAutoRevokeExempted` API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
