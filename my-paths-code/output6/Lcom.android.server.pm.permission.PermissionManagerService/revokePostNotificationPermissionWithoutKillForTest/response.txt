Since the method `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` does not perform any operations other than returning immediately, there are no potential sinks in this code. The method does not invoke any other methods, access or update any fields, create new objects, or return any sensitive data.

Therefore, the JSON response would be:

```
{
"Sinks": []
}
```
