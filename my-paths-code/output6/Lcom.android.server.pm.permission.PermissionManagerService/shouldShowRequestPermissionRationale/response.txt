Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules and contribute to a sink in the given code, the JSON response would be:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that there are no potential sinks identified in the provided API. The variable `v1` seems to be directly returned without any processing or interaction with other data that could indicate a sensitive operation or data flow related to the API parameters `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Without more context on where `v1` comes from, it's impossible to identify any potential sinks based on the given code snippet.
