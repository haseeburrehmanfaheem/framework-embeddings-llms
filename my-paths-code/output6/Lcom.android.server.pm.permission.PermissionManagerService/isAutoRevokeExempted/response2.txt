To determine the access control level for the `isAutoRevokeExempted` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided. 

The `isAutoRevokeExempted` method interacts with several sinks, including:
1. `AndroidPackage v2 = this.mPackageManagerInt.getPackage(p1);` - This line retrieves a package based on the input string `p1`.
2. `boolean v4 = this.mPackageManagerInt.filterAppAccess(p1, v3, p2);` - This checks if the app has access to the specified package.
3. `boolean v7 = this.mPackageManagerInt.isCallerInstallerOfRecord(v2, v3);` - This verifies if the caller is the installer of record for the package.
4. `int v11 = this.mAppOpsManager.checkOpNoThrow(97, v9, p1);` - This checks an app operation without throwing an exception.

The similar APIs provided are:
- `setAutoRevokeExempted(Ljava/lang/String;ZI)Z` with a similarity score of 0.8594613075256348 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
- `checkPhoneNumberAccess(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;II)I` with a similarity score of 0.7497442364692688 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. The `isAutoRevokeExempted` method, given its interactions with package management and app operation checks, seems to operate within a similar context of requiring elevated permissions to ensure security and privacy.

Given the method's operations and comparisons with similar APIs, it appears that the `isAutoRevokeExempted` method should also be classified under a similar access control level due to its involvement in checking app access and operations, which are sensitive actions typically restricted to system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code snippet and comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `isAutoRevokeExempted` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This classification reflects the method's need for elevated permissions to securely manage app access and operations.
