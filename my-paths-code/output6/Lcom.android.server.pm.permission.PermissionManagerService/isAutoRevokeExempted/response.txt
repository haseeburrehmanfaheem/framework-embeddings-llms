To analyze the provided code for potential sinks that require access control, let's examine both paths of the API `isAutoRevokeExempted` with depth 1.

### Path Analysis

Both paths are essentially identical, so we will consider them as one path for analysis. The key elements to focus on include method invocations, field accesses and updates, object creation, and data flows that could contribute to a sink.

#### Positive Rules Identification

- **Method Invoked**: Several methods are invoked in the API, including `getPackage`, `filterAppAccess`, `isCallerInstallerOfRecord`, `checkOpNoThrow`. The method names have naming similarity with the context of the API (e.g., package management and app access control), and they process input parameters (`p1` and `p2`) or return values that are used in further operations.
- **Field Access**: There is an indirect field access through method calls like `getUid()` on objects, but no direct field accesses with naming similarity to the API name.
- **Object Creation**: No explicit object creation with data flow from API parameters directly related to the sink rules.

#### Negative Rules Identification

- Generic utility methods and logging methods are not identified as significant contributors in this context.
- Auxiliary operations like obtaining an instance of a class (`this.mPackageManagerInt`, `Binder.getCallingUid()`) are present but do not represent sinks by themselves according to the negative rules.

### Sinks Identification

Given the analysis, potential sinks can be identified based on method invocations that process input parameters or have naming similarity with the API's context. Here is a breakdown of instructions contributing to a sink:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "AndroidPackage v2 = this.mPackageManagerInt.getPackage(p1);",
      "boolean v4 = this.mPackageManagerInt.filterAppAccess(p1, v3, p2);",
      "boolean v7 = this.mPackageManagerInt.isCallerInstallerOfRecord(v2, v3);",
      "int v11 = this.mAppOpsManager.checkOpNoThrow(97, v9, p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

These instructions form a coherent set of operations that contribute to the decision-making process within `isAutoRevokeExempted`, directly involving input parameters and return values in a manner consistent with at least one of the positive rules. They are ranked based on their direct involvement with sensitive operations (package management, app access filtering, and operation checks), which places them as high-priority sinks for access control consideration.

### Conclusion

The identified sink set involves critical method invocations that process input parameters (`p1` and `p2`) and involve the API's context (package and app access management). These operations directly influence the outcome of `isAutoRevokeExempted`, making them significant for access control analysis.
