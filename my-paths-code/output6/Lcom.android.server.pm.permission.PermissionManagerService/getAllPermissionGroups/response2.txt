To determine the access control level for the `getAllPermissionGroups` API, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `queryPermissionsByGroup` and `getCurrentRules`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`.

1. **Similarity in Functionality**: Both `queryPermissionsByGroup` and `getCurrentRules` return a `ParceledListSlice`, which is also the case for `getAllPermissionGroups`. This similarity in return types suggests that these methods are involved in retrieving or querying data, which might not necessarily require high levels of access control.

2. **Code Semantics**: The code snippets provided for all three APIs involve creating a new `ParceledListSlice` and returning it. This operation does not inherently suggest any dangerous or system-significant actions that would typically require elevated permissions (like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`).

3. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. This indicates that the operations they perform are considered safe and do not pose a risk to the system or user data, suggesting that similar functionality might also not require strict access controls.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to infer that `getAllPermissionGroups` would likely fall under a similar access control level as its counterparts, given the similarities in their return types, code operations, and the context provided by their known access control levels.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the analysis above, the final access control level for the `getAllPermissionGroups` API would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
