To assign an access control level to the `getSplitPermissions` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `getSplitPermissions` method has a simple return statement, `return v1;`, which suggests that it is retrieving a list of split permissions. The sink code also indicates that the method returns `v1`, which is likely a list of permissions.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs, such as `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` and `getPermissionFlags`, seem to be related to permission management and have similar code structures, with simple return statements. The high similarity score (1.0) suggests that these APIs are closely related to the `getSplitPermissions` method.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the `getSplitPermissions` method is also related to permission management and has a similar code structure to the other APIs. Therefore, it is likely that the access control level for this method should be consistent with the others.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
