To determine the access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method iterates through installed packages using `forEachInstalledPackage` and collects packages that meet a certain condition (related to auto-revoke exemption) in an `ArrayList`. This operation involves accessing package information, which can be sensitive.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages**: This method has a very high similarity score (0.9997791051864624), indicating that its functionality is almost identical to the method in question. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that it requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to its interaction with package management and permissions.
   - **findNanoAppOnHub**: Although this method has a lower similarity score (0.7688844203948975), it's worth noting for its different access control level (`NONE`). This method interacts with nano apps on a hub and doesn't seem to deal directly with sensitive package information or permissions, which might explain the lack of specific access control.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose significant security risks.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that require standard permissions but are not highly sensitive.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can cause significant harm if misused, often requiring explicit user consent.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-level or signature-protected operations, indicating a need for elevated privileges.

Given the above points:

- The method interacts closely with package management and permissions, which is sensitive information.
- The highly similar API (`getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages`) has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that such operations require system or signature-level permission due to their nature of dealing with package exemptions and permissions.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of accessing and managing package information related to auto-revoke exemptions, and aligning with the similar API's access control level, the most appropriate access control level for `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
