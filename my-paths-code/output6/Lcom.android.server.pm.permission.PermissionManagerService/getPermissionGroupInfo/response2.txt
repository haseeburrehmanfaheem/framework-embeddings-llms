To determine the access control level for the `getPermissionGroupInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Method Signature and Purpose**: The method `getPermissionGroupInfo(String p1, int p2)` is designed to retrieve information about a permission group based on the provided string and integer parameters. This suggests it interacts with sensitive data related to permissions.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **setVrThread(I)V**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`, but its purpose seems unrelated to permission management or sensitive data access. The high similarity score might be due to method signature similarities rather than functional equivalence.
   - **setFrontActivityScreenCompatMode(I)V**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its purpose is related to setting compatibility modes for activities, which can imply a need for system-level or signature-level permissions to ensure proper functionality and security.

3. **Sink Code**: The provided sink code is empty (`['']`), indicating there might not be direct, known vulnerabilities or sensitive data leaks associated with this method. However, the absence of explicit sink information does not necessarily imply the method is innocuous; it may still handle sensitive permission group information.

Considering these points:
- The `getPermissionGroupInfo` method deals with permission groups, which are inherently related to security and access control.
- Despite the high similarity scores with other methods, their purposes and access control levels vary significantly. The method's interaction with permission data suggests a need for controlled access.
- Given that `setFrontActivityScreenCompatMode(I)V` requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access, implying it deals with system or signature-level operations, and considering the nature of `getPermissionGroupInfo`, which involves retrieving sensitive permission information, it's reasonable to infer that this method should also have a restricted access level.

However, without explicit indication that `getPermissionGroupInfo` requires system or signature-level permissions (like setting modes), but knowing it deals with sensitive data (permission groups), the most appropriate access control level would lean towards protecting sensitive information without necessitating the highest levels of permission typically reserved for operations that modify system states or require signature verification.

Therefore, considering the method's purpose and the context provided by similar APIs, a balanced approach would suggest an access control level that acknowledges the sensitivity of the data it handles but does not over-specify its requirements based on the given similarities and differences.

Given these considerations, the final access control level for `getPermissionGroupInfo` could be reasoned as follows:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice reflects a balance between protecting sensitive permission group information and recognizing that this method's primary function is to retrieve information rather than perform actions that would necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` levels of access control. The absence of clear indicators for `NONE` (implying no restrictions) also supports selecting `NORMAL` as a cautious, middle-ground approach.
