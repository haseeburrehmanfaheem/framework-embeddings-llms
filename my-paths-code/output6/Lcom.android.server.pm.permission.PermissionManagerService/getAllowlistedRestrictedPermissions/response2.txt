To determine the access control level for the `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs (`getSplitPermissions()` and `getPermissionFlags()`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that methods related to permission management or retrieval in this context do not require strict access controls.

2. **Code Semantics**: The method `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` returns a list of permissions, which implies it is involved in managing or querying the state of permissions within the system. Given its purpose, it seems logical that it would follow a similar access control pattern as the APIs it's compared to, especially since those are directly related to permission management.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code `['return v1;']` simply returns a value without any conditional checks or modifications that could indicate a need for higher security clearance (like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`). This aligns with the behavior of the similar APIs provided, which also return values directly.

Considering these points, it appears that the `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method is primarily involved in retrieving information about permissions without altering system states or accessing sensitive data that would necessitate higher access control levels. Therefore, based on its similarity to other APIs with an access control level of `NONE`, and considering its functionality does not inherently require strict security measures, the most appropriate access control level for this method would be `NONE`.
