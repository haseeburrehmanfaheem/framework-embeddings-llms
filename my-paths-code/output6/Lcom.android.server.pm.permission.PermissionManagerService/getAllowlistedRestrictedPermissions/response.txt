Based on the provided code snippet, I'll analyze it according to the given rules.

Since there are no method invocations (other than the return statement), field access or updates, object creation, or data flows within the API, the only potential sink is the `return` statement itself. However, without knowing what `v1` represents, we cannot directly conclude if this is a sensitive operation.

Given that there's limited information about `v1`, and assuming it might be related to the method's purpose of returning allowlisted restricted permissions (which could potentially involve sensitive data), I'll consider it under the positive rule of having naming similarity with the API name or being returned by the API.

Here is the JSON representation of the potential sink:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "return v1;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This represents a single, coherent set of instructions (in this case, just one instruction) that could potentially form a sink due to its relation with the API's purpose and return value. However, without more context about `v1`, it's difficult to assess its sensitivity accurately.
