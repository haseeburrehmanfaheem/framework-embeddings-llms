Here is the analysis of the provided code:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        []
    ]
}
```
There are no potential sinks in this API because it does not contain any instructions that follow at least one of the positive rules. The method `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` does not invoke other methods, access or update fields, create new objects, or return values that could potentially be sinks. Additionally, this method does not seem to interact with the input parameter `p1` in a way that would make it a sink, and it simply returns without any further operations. The negative rule for auxiliary operations also applies here as adding a listener is an auxiliary operation.
