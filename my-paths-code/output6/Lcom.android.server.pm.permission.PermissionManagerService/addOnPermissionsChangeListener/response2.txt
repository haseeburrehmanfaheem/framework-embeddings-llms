To assign an access control level to the `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` takes an `IOnPermissionsChangeListener` interface as a parameter and returns without any additional operations. This implies that it's setting up a listener for permissions changes, which doesn't inherently perform any dangerous or sensitive operations by itself.

2. **Sink Code**: The provided sink code is empty (`['']`), indicating there might not be direct interactions with sensitive data or operations within the method's immediate scope.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setVrThread(I)V**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. Given its similarity score is very high (nearly 1), it suggests that both methods might have similar usage patterns or are used in contexts where no specific permissions or protections are required beyond normal application execution.
   - **setFrontActivityScreenCompatMode(I)V**: With an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this API implies a need for either system-level permissions or signature-level access due to its operations potentially affecting system-wide settings or behaviors. Despite the high similarity score, this method's access control suggests it deals with more sensitive or system-critical functionality.

Considering these points:
- The `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` method itself doesn't seem to perform dangerous operations directly but is involved in listening for permissions changes.
- The similar APIs provide a mixed signal: one suggests no special access control (`NONE`), while the other implies system or signature-level access (`SYS_OR_SIG`).
- Given that listening for permissions changes might require awareness of the application's state and potentially sensitive information regarding what permissions are being requested or granted, but without directly performing dangerous operations, we must weigh the need for protection against the method's functionality.

However, since `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` is about setting a listener for permission changes (which could be related to system or app security), it might not fit perfectly into the `NONE` category if we consider the potential implications of permissions management. Yet, without explicit evidence of direct system modifications or sensitive data access within its immediate operation (as the sink code is empty and the method body doesn't indicate such operations), assigning it a `SYS_OR_SIG` level based solely on similarity might not be fully justified either.

Given these considerations and the fact that the method seems to be more about monitoring or reacting to system states rather than directly altering them, a balanced approach would lean towards requiring some form of access control but not necessarily at the system or signature level unless explicitly interacting with sensitive data or operations, which isn't clearly indicated here.

Therefore, considering the method's purpose and the lack of explicit dangerous operations within its provided scope, the most fitting access control level seems to be `NORMAL`, as it reflects a need for some level of protection or awareness (due to its involvement in permissions monitoring) without escalating to system or signature-level requirements based on the information given.
