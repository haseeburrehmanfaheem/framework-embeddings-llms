To determine the access control level for the `clearStatuses` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The first similar API, `clearStatus(Ljava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V`, has a high similarity score of 0.9757576584815979 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method interacts with sensitive data (e.g., package data, conversation info) and involves user handling (`handleIncomingUser`), which suggests it requires a significant level of access control.
   - The second similar API, `isConversation(Ljava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/String;)Z`, has a lower similarity score of 0.9100236892700195 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This method seems to be more about querying or checking the existence of conversations rather than modifying them.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code provided involves handling incoming users, accessing package data, getting conversation stores, and updating conversation info. These operations are sensitive as they involve user data and potentially system-level interactions.
   - Key operations like `handleIncomingUser`, `getPackage`, `getConversationStore`, `addOrUpdate` conversation info, and notifying listeners about conversations indicate that this method is capable of modifying or clearing statuses related to conversations, which could be security-sensitive.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not pose a significant risk or require no special permissions.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that might require some level of permission but are generally not as sensitive as system-level operations.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can cause harm if misused, often requiring explicit user consent.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: For system-level operations or those that require signature-level permissions, indicating a high level of access control.

Given the analysis:
- The method `clearStatuses` involves handling user data and modifying conversation statuses, which suggests it requires more than a basic level of access control.
- Its similarity to the `clearStatus` API with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` implies that it might also require significant permissions due to its potential impact on system or user data.
- However, without explicit indicators of danger (like those requiring explicit user consent for operations that can cause direct harm), and considering it's more about modifying conversation statuses rather than directly accessing sensitive system resources, the assignment leans towards requiring system or signature-level access control.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of similar APIs, sink code, and the nature of operations performed by `clearStatuses`, it seems most appropriate to assign an access control level that reflects its potential impact on user data and system interactions.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is made considering the method's interaction with sensitive data, user handling, and the need for a level of permission that ensures only authorized components can modify conversation statuses.
