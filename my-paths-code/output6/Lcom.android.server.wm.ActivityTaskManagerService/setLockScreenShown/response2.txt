Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `setLockScreenShown` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setLockScreenShown` method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them contain the following sink code:

1. `if (this.mKeyguardShown == p1) {...}`: This suggests that the method is modifying a security-related state variable (`mKeyguardShown`).
2. `long v5 = Binder.clearCallingIdentity();` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5);`: These lines indicate that the method is using binder to clear and restore the calling identity, which is a common pattern in Android's system services to ensure that sensitive operations are performed with the correct permissions.

The similar APIs provided also contain the same binder-related code and have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Given this information, I conclude that the `setLockScreenShown` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is modifying security-related state variables and using binder to perform sensitive operations.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
