To determine the access control level for the `getRootTaskInfo` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `getFocusedRootTaskInfo()`: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It involves creating a new `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo` object, filling it with task info, checking visibility, getting descendant task counts, and other operations related to task management.
   - `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay(III)`: This API also has an access control level of `NONE`. It performs similar operations as `getFocusedRootTaskInfo`, including creating a new `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo` object and gathering task information.

2. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   The sink code provided involves operations such as creating a new `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo` object, filling it with task info (`v7.fillTaskInfo(v12)`), getting display content (`DisplayContent v15 = v7.getDisplayContent()`), checking for all root tasks (`boolean v20 = v15.forAllRootTasks(v18, 0)`), and other task-related information gathering. These operations are similar to those found in the provided similar APIs.

3. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the nature of the operations performed by `getRootTaskInfo`, which involves gathering and returning task information without any indication of modifying system state or accessing sensitive data in a way that would require elevated permissions, it suggests that `getRootTaskInfo` should also be classified as having an access control level of `NONE`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Based on the similarity in operations with other APIs classified as `NONE`, and considering the nature of the task information gathering without apparent sensitive data access or system state modification, the access control level for `getRootTaskInfo` should be `NONE`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
