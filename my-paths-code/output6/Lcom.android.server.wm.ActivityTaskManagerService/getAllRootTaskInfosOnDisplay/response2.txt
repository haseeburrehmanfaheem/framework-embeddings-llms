To determine the access control level for the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippets Analysis**:
   - The method `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` has three paths with similar operations: clearing the calling identity, iterating over tasks (using a lambda expression that extends `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks`), and then restoring the calling identity.
   - It involves interaction with `RootWindowContainer`, `WindowContainer`, and uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)` which suggests it's dealing with IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and potentially sensitive operations.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippet is essentially about creating an `ArrayList`, initializing a lambda expression to operate on root tasks, and then executing this operation across all root tasks using `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks`.
   - This operation seems to be gathering information about tasks without explicitly modifying system state or accessing sensitive data directly.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `getAllRootTaskInfos()` has a very high similarity score (0.999719500541687) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
   - This similar API performs essentially the same operation: gathering task information without any apparent modification or sensitive data access.
   - Another similar API, `finishVoiceTask`, although less similar in terms of code structure, also operates at the `NONE` access control level. It interacts with voice tasks but doesn't imply a higher access control level due to its operations.

**Conclusion**:
Given that the most similar API (`getAllRootTaskInfos()`) operates at an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of the operations performed by `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` (gathering task information without apparent sensitive data access or system state modification), it's reasonable to conclude that `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` should also operate at a similar access control level.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the method's functionality being closely related to gathering information about tasks, which aligns with the behavior of other APIs classified under the `NONE` access control level. The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)` suggests awareness of security contexts but does not inherently imply a need for elevated access control beyond what's necessary for task information gathering.
