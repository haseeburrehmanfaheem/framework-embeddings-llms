To assign an access control level to the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information.

1. **Code Snippets**: All three paths of the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method involve clearing the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and then checking a condition before potentially restoring the identity with `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`. Two out of the three paths also involve boosting or resetting the window manager thread priority using `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show interactions with `Binder` for clearing and restoring calling identities, which is a common pattern in Android for temporarily changing the process's identity to perform operations that require different permissions.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **removeRootTasksInWindowingModes([I)V**: This API has a high similarity score with `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes`. It also involves clearing the calling identity and interacting with `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster`, but its access control level is `NONE`.
   
Given this information, we need to consider why an API might be assigned a particular access control level:
- **NONE**: Typically used for APIs that do not pose significant risks or require special permissions.
- **NORMAL**: For APIs that require some level of permission but are generally safe and intended for use by most apps.
- **DANGEROUS**: Used for APIs that can potentially cause harm, leak sensitive data, or significantly impact the user's experience if misused.
- **SYS_OR_SIG**: Reserved for system or signature applications, indicating the API is either for internal system use or requires a specific signature level permission.

Considering the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method:
- It involves clearing and restoring calling identities, which suggests it's performing operations that might require different permissions temporarily.
- The interaction with `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster` could imply it affects system resources or performance.
- However, the similar APIs (`removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that these operations, despite involving identity changes and system resource adjustments, are not considered dangerous or requiring special permissions.

Given the high similarity with other APIs labeled as `NONE` and considering the nature of the operations (which seem to be related to task management within Android and do not explicitly indicate a risk of data leakage, financial loss, etc.), it's reasonable to infer that the access control level for `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` should also be `NONE`.

**Access Control Level:**
