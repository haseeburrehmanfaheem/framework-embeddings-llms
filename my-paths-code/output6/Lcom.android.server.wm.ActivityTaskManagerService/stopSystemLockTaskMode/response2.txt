Based on the provided information, we need to assign an access control level to the `stopSystemLockTaskMode` method. 

The `stopSystemLockTaskMode` method has two paths with similar code snippets. Both paths involve checking the calling UID and clearing the locked task using `LockTaskController.clearLockedTask()`. Additionally, they interact with the telecom service using `TelecomManager.getTelecomService()`.

Comparing this to the similar API `keyguardGoingAway(I)V`, we see that both methods:

1. Use `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `this.sThreadPriorityBooster.boost()` for thread priority management.
2. Interact with system-level components (`LockTaskController` and `TelecomManager`).
3. Require a specific access control level due to their system-level interactions.

Given the similarity in code structure and interaction with system-level components, we can infer that `stopSystemLockTaskMode` should have a similar access control level as `keyguardGoingAway(I)V`, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" \}}$
