To determine the access control level for the `supportsLocalVoiceInteraction` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar API, `getVoiceInteractorPackageName`, which has an access control level of `NONE`.

The code snippet for `supportsLocalVoiceInteraction` shows that it:

1. Retrieves an object from `sLocalServiceObjects` using `VoiceInteractionManagerInterna.class` as the key.
2. Calls the `supportsLocalVoiceInteraction` method on the retrieved object and returns the result.

Similarly, the `getVoiceInteractorPackageName` API:

1. Retrieves an object from `sLocalServiceObjects` using `VoiceInteractionManagerInterna.class` as the key (same as `supportsLocalVoiceInteraction`).
2. Calls a different method (`getVoiceInteractorPackageName`) on the retrieved object and returns the result.

Both methods interact with the same service object (`VoiceInteractionManagerInterna.class`) and perform a similar operation (calling a method on the service object). The main difference is the specific method being called, but this does not imply a difference in access control level based on the provided information.

Given that `getVoiceInteractorPackageName` has an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the similarities between the two APIs in terms of how they interact with the service object, it's reasonable to conclude that `supportsLocalVoiceInteraction` should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because both methods seem to be querying or retrieving information without any indication of performing sensitive operations that would require higher access control levels like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `supportsLocalVoiceInteraction` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
