To determine the access control level for the `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: All three paths of the `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method involve similar operations:
   - They clear the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`.
   - They interact with `RecentTasks` and `UserManagerService`, which suggests they are dealing with user-specific data and recent tasks.
   - The methods check for profile IDs and task sizes, indicating some form of validation or filtering based on user and task criteria.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves getting the recent tasks (`RecentTasks v6 = p0.getRecentTasks();`) and the current user ID (`int v7 = this.mAmInternal.getCurrentUserId();`). This interaction with recent tasks and user IDs is crucial for understanding the method's functionality and potential security implications.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `startActivityAsUser`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8554663062095642 with `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks`. It is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission. The code snippet shows interaction with recent tasks and component names, suggesting a need for protected access due to its potential impact on the system's state.
   - `getRecentTasks`: With a similarity score of 0.7896568775177002, this API also interacts with recent tasks and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The provided code indicates handling of user IDs and returning a list of recent tasks, which could contain sensitive information.

Given the similarities in functionality, especially the interaction with recent tasks and user management, and considering the access control levels of similar APIs (`startActivityAsUser` and `getRecentTasks` are both `SYS_OR_SIG`), it's reasonable to conclude that `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` should also have a protected access level. This is because manipulating recent tasks could potentially impact system security or user privacy, requiring a higher level of access control.

**Access Control Level**: Considering the method's interaction with sensitive data (recent tasks and user IDs) and its potential to alter system state, along with the similar APIs' access control levels, `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` should be assigned an access control level that reflects the need for protected access.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that only authorized components (either system-level or those holding specific signatures) can execute this method, thereby protecting user data and maintaining system integrity.
