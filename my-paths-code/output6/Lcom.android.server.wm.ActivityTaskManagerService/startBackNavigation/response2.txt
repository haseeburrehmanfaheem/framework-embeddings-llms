Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `startBackNavigation` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `startBackNavigation` method appears to be related to handling back navigation in the Android system, specifically when interacting with the recents animation controller and focused window tokens. The method's code snippet shows that it performs various checks and operations, including logging debug messages, checking activity records, and overriding back callbacks.

The similar APIs provided, `startActivity` and `setRunningRemoteTransitionDelegate`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs seem to be related to starting activities, managing recents animations, and updating running remote transitions. They also perform operations that require system or signature-level permissions, such as boosting priority for locked sections, tracing, and posting delayed tasks.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `startBackNavigation` method, it is likely that the `startBackNavigation` method also requires system or signature-level permissions to perform its operations. Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippets and similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `startBackNavigation` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
