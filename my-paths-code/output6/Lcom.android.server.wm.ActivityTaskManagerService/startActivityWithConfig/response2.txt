To determine the access control level for the `startActivityWithConfig` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `startActivityWithConfig` method interacts with sensitive components, such as:

1.  `handleIncomingUser`: This method is used to handle incoming user requests, which involves user authentication and authorization.
2.  `ActivityStarter`: This class is responsible for starting activities, which can potentially launch malicious apps if not properly validated.

The similar APIs provided, `startActivityAndWait` and `startAssistantActivity`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with sensitive components, such as `handleIncomingUser` and `ActivityStarter`.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all deal with starting activities or handling user requests, it's reasonable to conclude that the `startActivityWithConfig` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the comparison with similar APIs, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `startActivityWithConfig` method.

```json
{
    "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
