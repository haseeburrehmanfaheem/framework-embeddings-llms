To assign an access control level to the `startActivityAndWait` method, we should analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `startActivityAndWait` method involves the following key operations:

1. **Handling incoming user**: It calls `this.mAmInternal.handleIncomingUser` to handle the incoming user, which suggests that it is dealing with user-related information and potentially has access control implications.
2. **Setting up ActivityStarter**: The method sets up an `ActivityStarter` object with various parameters such as intent, caller, calling package, resolved type, result to, result who, request code, start flags, and profiler info. This indicates that it is starting a new activity, which may require certain permissions or access control.
3. **Executing the ActivityStarter**: The method executes the `ActivityStarter` object, which returns a `WaitResult`.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `startActivityWithConfig`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and its code snippet shows similarities with `startActivityAndWait`. Both methods handle incoming users, set up an `ActivityStarter` object, and execute it. The main difference is that `startActivityWithConfig` takes an additional `Configuration` parameter.
* `startAssistantActivity`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and its code snippet shows some similarities with `startActivityAndWait`. Both methods handle incoming users and set up an `ActivityStarter` object. However, `startAssistantActivity` has a different set of parameters and does not execute the `ActivityStarter` in the same way.

Given these comparisons, it seems that `startActivityAndWait` is similar to the other two APIs in terms of its access control implications. All three methods deal with starting new activities and handling user-related information, which may require certain permissions or access control.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG** to the `startActivityAndWait` method, as it is similar to the other two APIs in terms of its functionality and potential access control implications.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
