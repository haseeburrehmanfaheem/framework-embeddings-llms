To determine the access control level for the `resumeAppSwitches` method, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar API, `stopAppSwitches`.

1. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The `resumeAppSwitches` method modifies the state of app switches by setting `mAppSwitchesState` to 2. This indicates a change in the system's state related to app switching.
   - It also removes messages with code 4 from the handler `mH`, which suggests it is managing or interrupting some scheduled tasks or events related to app switching.

2. **Comparison with Similar API**:
   - The `stopAppSwitches` method, with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, sets `mAppSwitchesState` to 0, which implies stopping or halting the app switches.
   - Given that both methods modify the `mAppSwitchesState` and are related to managing app switches (one stops, the other resumes), they likely operate within similar security contexts.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Since the `stopAppSwitches` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions due to its potential impact on system behavior and security, we should consider if `resumeAppSwitches` operates within a similar risk profile.
   - Modifying app switch states could potentially affect system performance, user experience, or even security by altering how apps are handled. Thus, this action might not be suitable for all applications or users without proper authorization.

Given these considerations and the fact that both methods deal with sensitive system states related to app switching, it's reasonable to conclude that `resumeAppSwitches` should have a similar access control level to `stopAppSwitches`, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized components (either system-level or those signed with the platform key) can resume app switches, maintaining system integrity and security.
