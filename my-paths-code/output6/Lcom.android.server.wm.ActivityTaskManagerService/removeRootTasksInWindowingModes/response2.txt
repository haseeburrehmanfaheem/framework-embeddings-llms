To determine the access control level for the `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The given code paths for `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` involve the following key elements:
1. `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`: This is used to clear the calling identity, which is a security-related operation.
2. `this.mChildren.size()`: This retrieves the size of a collection (likely related to tasks or windows), which seems to be an internal operation not directly exposing sensitive data.
3. `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster.boost()` and `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster.reset()`: These methods are related to boosting and resetting thread priorities, respectively, which could potentially have system-wide implications but seem more related to performance optimization than security or privacy risks.

The similar APIs provided (`removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes([I)V`) both have an access control level of `NONE`. Their code snippets show similarities with the paths of `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`, including the use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and accessing `this.mChildren.size()`. The presence of `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster` methods in some paths also suggests a focus on task management and performance rather than sensitive data access or modification.

Given these observations:
- The operations within `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` do not appear to directly manipulate sensitive user data, perform dangerous operations, or require special system privileges beyond what's granted through the binder and window manager mechanisms.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that their operations are considered safe and do not pose significant security risks.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the nature of the operations performed by `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
