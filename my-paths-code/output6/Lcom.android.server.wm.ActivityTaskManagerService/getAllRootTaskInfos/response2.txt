Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method.

Firstly, let's examine the code snippet of the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method. It creates an `ArrayList`, iterates over the root tasks using `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks`, and returns the list of tasks. The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity` to clear the calling identity and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity` to restore it, which suggests that it is interacting with system-level components.

The sink code provided also shows that the method is using `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks` to iterate over the root tasks, which is a similar pattern to the similar APIs provided.

Now, let's analyze the similar APIs:

1. `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay(I)Ljava/util/List;`: This API has a similarity score of 0.999719500541687 and an access control level of NONE. The code snippet is almost identical to the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method, which suggests that they are performing similar operations.
2. `finishVoiceTask(Landroid/service/voice/IVoiceInteractionSession;)V`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9338365197181702 and an access control level of NONE. Although the code snippet is not identical, it also uses `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks` to iterate over the root tasks.

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method is performing a similar operation to the similar APIs, which have an access control level of NONE. Therefore, it is likely that the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method also requires an access control level of NONE.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
