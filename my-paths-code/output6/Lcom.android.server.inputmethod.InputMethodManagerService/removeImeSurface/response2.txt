To determine the access control level for the `removeImeSurface` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

1. **Similarity with notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()V**: This API has a high similarity score of 0.9672578573226929 and is assigned an access control level of NORMAL. The code snippet for `notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached` involves obtaining a message from a handler and sending it to the target, which is similar to the operation performed in `removeImeSurface`. This suggests that if the operation is not considered dangerous or requiring system or signature permissions, it might fall under a similar access control level.

2. **Similarity with forgetVolume(Ljava/lang/String;)V**: This API has a similarity score of 0.9468216300010681 and is assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Although the operation is similar in terms of sending a message to a handler, the access control level is more restrictive. This could imply that operations related to volume or other system-level functionalities require higher permission levels.

Considering these similarities and the nature of the `removeImeSurface` method:
- It does not directly interact with sensitive user data or perform actions that would typically require dangerous permissions (like accessing location, camera, etc.).
- The operation is more related to internal management (removing an IME surface), which might not necessitate system or signature-level access control.

Given the above analysis and considering the provided similarities, the most appropriate access control level for `removeImeSurface` would be NORMAL, as it aligns with the operations that do not require sensitive permissions but are still part of the normal functioning of the application, similar to `notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()V`.
