Based on the provided code and following the rules specified, I analyze it as follows:

The method `removeImeSurface()` is invoked. Inside this method, a new `Message` object named `v2` is created using `this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1060)`. This `Message` object has a direct data flow link with the API parameters (in this case, implicitly through the handler and message ID).

The creation of the `Message` object and its subsequent sending via `sendToTarget()` directly relate to the method's purpose. However, according to the rules provided:

- The creation of new objects follows the positive rule because it has a direct link with the API's operation.
- The method invocation `obtainMessage(1060)` is considered a utility method and doesn't directly follow the naming similarity or return value rule for being a sink on its own but contributes to creating the object that could be considered under the data flow from the API parameters.

However, given the context of this specific code snippet and applying the rules strictly:

The `Message` creation and sending can be seen as part of the API's operation. Since there are no input parameters being directly processed or returned values that match the positive rules for sinks, but considering the object creation and method invocation in the context of data flow within the API:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Message v2 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1060);",
      "v2.sendToTarget();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This identifies a single set of instructions that together form a potential sink, with a clear data flow link between them. The creation and sending of the `Message` object are directly related to the API's operation, even though it doesn't strictly follow all positive rules due to the lack of explicit input parameters or returned values matching those rules.
