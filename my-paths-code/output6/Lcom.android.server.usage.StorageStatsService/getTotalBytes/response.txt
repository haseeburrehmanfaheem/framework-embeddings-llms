To identify potential sinks in the given API, we'll break down the code and analyze it step by step according to the provided rules.

The API `getTotalBytes` takes two string parameters `p1` and `p2`, but only uses `p1` within its logic. 

Here's a breakdown of what happens in the code:

1. The method first checks if `p1` is not equal to `StorageManager.UUID_PRIVATE_INTERNAL`. This is an input validation or sanity check, which according to the negative rules, does not typically indicate a sink.

2. If the condition is true, it then attempts to find a volume by UUID using `this.mStorage.findVolumeByUuid(p1)`. The method `findVolumeByUuid` has naming similarity with storage-related operations and processes the input parameter `p1`, which could potentially indicate a sink according to the positive rules.

3. If `v1` (the result of `findVolumeByUuid`) is null or 0, it calculates a rounded storage size using `FileUtils.roundStorageSize(DiskInfo.size)` and returns this value. The method invocation `roundStorageSize` does not directly relate to the API's name or parameters but deals with storage sizes, which might be considered relevant in the context of storage management.

Given these steps, we can identify potential sinks based on the rules provided:

- The line `VolumeInfo v1 = this.mStorage.findVolumeByUuid(p1);` could be part of a sink because it processes the input parameter and has naming similarity with storage operations.
- The creation and return of `long v2 = FileUtils.roundStorageSize(DiskInfo.size);` might also be considered a sink, as it deals with storage information, though its direct connection to the API's parameters is less clear.

However, since there isn't a direct data flow from one instruction to another that creates an object or method invocation directly linked to both `p1` and the return value in a manner that clearly indicates a sensitive operation (like accessing or modifying specific user data based on input), we need to carefully apply the rules:

The most relevant code for potential sinks, following the positive rules about method invocations and considering the flow of data within the API, would be focused around how the input parameters influence the operations performed. 

Since `FileUtils.roundStorageSize(DiskInfo.size)` doesn't directly use the input parameters `p1` or `p2`, its connection to being a sink is less strong based on the provided rules. However, it's involved in determining the return value of the API under certain conditions.

Given this analysis, and focusing strictly on the code and rules provided without additional context about what constitutes sensitive operations in this specific domain (storage management), we might consider the following as potential sinks due to their involvement with the API's logic and parameter processing:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "VolumeInfo v1 = this.mStorage.findVolumeByUuid(p1);",
      "long v2 = FileUtils.roundStorageSize(DiskInfo.size);",
      "return v2;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This grouping suggests that the operations related to finding a volume by UUID and then potentially returning a calculated storage size could be considered part of a sink, given their involvement in processing the input parameter `p1` and determining the API's return value. However, it's essential to note that without more specific information about what constitutes sensitive data or operations in this context, the identification of sinks relies heavily on applying the general rules provided.
