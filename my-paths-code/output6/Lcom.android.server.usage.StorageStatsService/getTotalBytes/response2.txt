To determine the access control level for the `getTotalBytes` method, let's analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis of `getTotalBytes`:**
   - The method takes two parameters (`p1` and `p2`) and returns a long value representing total bytes.
   - It checks if `p1` is not equal to `StorageManager.UUID_PRIVATE_INTERNAL`. If true, it attempts to find a volume by UUID using `this.mStorage.findVolumeByUuid(p1)`.
   - If a volume is found (i.e., `v1` is not null), the method does not directly return a value based on `v1`. Instead, if `v1` is null (indicating no volume was found by the given UUID), it calculates and returns a rounded storage size using `FileUtils.roundStorageSize(DiskInfo.size)`.
   - The sink code lines indicate interactions with storage information, specifically finding volumes by UUID and calculating storage sizes.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`getVolumes(I)[Landroid/os/storage/VolumeInfo;`** with an access control level of `NONE`:
     - This method returns an array of `VolumeInfo` objects based on the size of `this.mVolumes`.
     - Its similarity score with `getTotalBytes` is 0.7792941927909851, indicating a moderate to high similarity.
     - The access control level is `NONE`, suggesting that this method does not pose significant security risks.
   - **`getFreeBytes(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)J`** with an access control level of `NONE`:
     - This method calculates and returns the free bytes available for a given UUID, considering cache bytes and usable space.
     - Its similarity score with `getTotalBytes` is 0.7463377118110657, also indicating a moderate to high similarity.
     - The access control level is `NONE`, suggesting that this method does not pose significant security risks.

**Decision for Access Control Level:**

Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that both comparable APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that accessing or calculating storage information (like total bytes) based on provided parameters does not inherently pose a significant security risk. The operations within `getTotalBytes` involve querying storage information, which is similar to the operations in the compared APIs.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `getTotalBytes` should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
