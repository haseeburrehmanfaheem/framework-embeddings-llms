Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `queryExternalStatsForUser` method interacts with the `getInstalledApplicationsAsUser` and `getExternalSize` methods, which are related to storage statistics. The method also returns an `ExternalStorageStats` object, which contains sensitive information about the device's storage.

The similar APIs provided have a similarity score of 0.8001298904418945 and 0.7654139995574951, respectively, and both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with storage-related methods and return sensitive information.

Given the similarities between the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method and the provided APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `queryExternalStatsForUser` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method can only be accessed by system or signature applications, which helps to protect sensitive storage information from unauthorized access.
