To determine the access control level for the `addBlockedRating` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The code snippets show that the method interacts with user states and blocked ratings, using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`, which suggests some level of permission checking or identity verification. However, these calls are primarily used for logging or debugging purposes in this context rather than enforcing strict access control.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code points to interactions with `TvInputManagerService$UserState` and modifications to blocked ratings (`this.mBlockedRatings.contains(v16)` and `this.mBlockedRatings.add(v16)`). These operations are related to managing content ratings, which could have implications for user privacy or content restriction but don't inherently suggest a need for dangerous or system-level permissions.

3. **Similar APIs**: The similar APIs provided (`removeBlockedRating`) both have an access control level of `NONE`. Given the high similarity scores (0.8409157991409302 and 0.8310525417327881), it suggests that `addBlockedRating` likely operates within a similar context or with similar constraints as these methods.

Considering these points:
- The method does not seem to require system-level permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG`) based on the operations performed.
- It doesn't directly interact with sensitive data that would typically require `DANGEROUS` permission levels (e.g., location, contacts, camera).
- Given its functionality and similarity to other APIs with `NONE` access control, it seems reasonable that managing blocked content ratings might not necessitate strict access controls.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `addBlockedRating` method would be `NORMAL`. This conclusion stems from the method's operations being related to user preference or setting management rather than direct access to sensitive data or system resources that would demand more stringent permissions.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

However, based on my analysis above and typical Android practices for such methods which usually require at least normal permission but can often be classified as not needing specific permissions due to their nature of modifying local user settings or preferences:

Corrected Response:
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
