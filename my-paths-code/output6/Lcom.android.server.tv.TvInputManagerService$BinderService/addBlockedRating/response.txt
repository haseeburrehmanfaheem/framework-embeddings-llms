After carefully examining the provided Java code for the `addBlockedRating` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "TvInputManagerService$UserState v11 = TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2);",
      "PersistentDataStore v15 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetpersistentDataStore(v9);",
      "TvContentRating v16 = TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(p1);",
      "boolean v20 = this.mBlockedRatings.contains(v16);",
      "boolean v21 = this.mBlockedRatings.add(v16);"
    ],
    [
      "TvInputManagerService$UserState v11 = TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2);",
      "PersistentDataStore v12 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetpersistentDataStore(v9);",
      "TvContentRating v13 = TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(p1);",
      "boolean v17 = this.mBlockedRatings.contains(v13);",
      "boolean v18 = this.mBlockedRatings.add(v13);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

In both paths, the API `addBlockedRating` is analyzed to identify potential sinks. The identified sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

1. Method invocation: `getUserStateLocked`, `unflattenFromString`, and `contains` methods are invoked with input parameters `p2` and `p1`.
2. Field access and updates: `mBlockedRatings` field is accessed and updated using the `add` method.
3. Object creation: `TvContentRating` object is created using the `unflattenFromString` method.

The sinks are ranked based on their sensitivity, with the first sink being more sensitive as it involves both user state retrieval and rating blocking. The second sink, although similar, has a slightly different flow due to the differences in variable assignments and field access. Both sinks demonstrate data propagation from input parameters to internal fields and object creation.

Note that some instructions, such as logging methods (not present in this example), generic utility methods (`Binder.getCallingPid`, `Binder.getCallingUid`), and auxiliary operations (`ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, `Binder.clearCallingIdentity`) are excluded from the identified sinks according to the negative rules.
