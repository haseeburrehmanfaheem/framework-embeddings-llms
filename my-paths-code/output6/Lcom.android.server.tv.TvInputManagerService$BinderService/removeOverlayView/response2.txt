To assign an access control level to the `removeOverlayView` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `removeOverlayView` method involves getting the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`, respectively.
   - It handles incoming users via `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser(p2, p3, p4, 0, 0, p5, 0)`.
   - The method accesses a session state locked by `TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked(p2, p3, p4)` and then gets an `ITvInputSession` object.
   - It calls `removeOverlayView()` on the `ITvInputSession` object, which suggests it's modifying or interacting with TV input sessions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves handling incoming users, getting a session state locked, obtaining an `ITvInputSession`, and then calling `removeOverlayView()` on it.
   - This indicates that the method is directly interacting with TV input sessions, potentially modifying their state or behavior.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `setCaptionEnabled(Landroid/os/IBinder;ZI)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Another similar API, `removeMediaView(Landroid/os/IBinder;I)V`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Both of these APIs interact with sessions (either TV input or interactive app sessions) and perform operations that could affect system behavior or user experience.

Given the above analysis:
- The method interacts with system-level components (TV input sessions).
- It performs actions that can modify the state of these sessions (`removeOverlayView`).
- Similar APIs that also interact with system sessions have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, considering the interaction with system components and the similarity in functionality with other APIs labeled as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that the `removeOverlayView` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
