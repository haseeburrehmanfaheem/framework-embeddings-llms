Based on the provided code, I've identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int v5 = ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser(p2, p3, p4, 0, 0, p5, 0);",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v10 = TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked(p2, p3, p4);",
      "ITvInputSession v11 = TvInputManagerService.getSessionLocked(v10);",
      "v8.tune(p2, p3);"
    ],
    [
      "TvInputManagerService$UserState v16 = new TvInputManagerService$UserState(this.mContext,p2,0);",
      "this.mUserStates.put(p2, v16);",
      "Map v21 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetsessionStateMap(p4);",
      "Object v22 = v21.get(p2);"
    ],
    [
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v20 = v22;",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v19 = v20;",
      "boolean v24 = TvInputManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fgetisCurrent(v19);",
      "Uri v25 = TvInputManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fgetcurrentChannel(v19);",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fputisCurrent(v19, 1);",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fputcurrentChannel(v19, p2);"
    ],
    [
      "RemoteCallbackList v31 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetmCallbacks(p2);",
      "int v32 = v31.beginBroadcast();",
      "v33.finishBroadcast();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Note that I've ranked the sinks based on their potential sensitivity and data flow. The first sink array is the most sensitive, as it involves method invocations with input parameters `p2` and `p3`, which are used to tune an ITvInputSession object.

The second sink array is related to creating a new TvInputManagerService$UserState object and storing it in a map, which may be considered less sensitive but still relevant due to the naming similarity with the API name and the use of input parameters `p2`.

The third sink array involves modifying TvInputManagerService$SessionState objects, which is also less sensitive compared to the first two sinks but still follows positive rules.

Finally, the fourth sink array is related to broadcasting events using RemoteCallbackList, which may be considered less sensitive due to its auxiliary nature.
