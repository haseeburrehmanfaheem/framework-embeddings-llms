To determine the access control level for the `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` method, we need to consider its similarity to other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are:

1. `timeShiftEnablePositionTracking`: With a similarity score of 0.9507042169570923 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `timeShiftPause`: With a similarity score of 0.9425580501556396 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these similar APIs have the same access control level, `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they are considered system or signature protected. This means that only the system or applications signed with the same certificate as the system can call these methods.

Looking at the code snippet provided for `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` and comparing it to the similar APIs, we see a similar pattern in how the session state is retrieved and how an action (in this case, setting interactive app notification enabled) is performed on an `ITvInputSession` object. The logic flow, including getting the calling UID and PID, handling the incoming user, and clearing/restoring the calling identity, further supports that this method interacts with system-level functionalities.

Given these observations:

- The high similarity scores to other APIs classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The interaction with system-level services (`TvInputManagerService`) and the management of sessions (`ITvInputSession`).
- The pattern of retrieving session states and performing actions on them, which is similar to other `SYS_OR_SIG` classified methods.

The final access control level for the API should be consistent with its peers that share similar functionality and system interaction patterns. Therefore, considering all these factors:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This classification aligns with how similar APIs are treated in terms of access control, reflecting the method's involvement in system-level operations that require protection against unauthorized access.
