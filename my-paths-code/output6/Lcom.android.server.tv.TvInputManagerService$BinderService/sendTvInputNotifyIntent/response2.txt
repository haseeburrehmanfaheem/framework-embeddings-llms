Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` method.

The method interacts with the following sinks:

* `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`
* `Binder.clearCallingIdentity`
* `Context.sendBroadcastAsUser`

The similar APIs provided, `registerAppLinkInfo` and `unregisterAppLinkInfo`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with the `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` sink.

However, the `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` method sends a broadcast using `Context.sendBroadcastAsUser`, which can potentially affect other apps or system components. This suggests that the method may require some level of access control to prevent unauthorized broadcasts.

Considering the similarity scores and the code snippets provided, it appears that the `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` method is related to TV input management and interactive app services. The method's interaction with the `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` sink and the use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity` suggest that it may be handling user-specific or sensitive information.

Given these factors, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` method. This level indicates that the method requires some level of access control, but it is not as sensitive as methods that require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
