Based on the provided code, here is the analysis of potential sinks:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v11 = TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked(p2, p3, v10);",
            "ITvInputSession v14 = TvInputManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fgetsession(p2);",
            "v12.removeBroadcastInfo(p2);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked` method is invoked with parameters `p2`, `p3`, and `v10`. This method has high naming similarity with the API name `removeBroadcastInfo`, and it processes input parameters.
2. The output of `getSessionStateLocked` is used to access the field `session` in the `TvInputManagerService$SessionState` class, which returns an `ITvInputSession` object.
3. This `ITvInputSession` object is then used to invoke the `removeBroadcastInfo` method with parameter `p2`.

These instructions are connected through data flow: the output of `getSessionStateLocked` influences the creation of the `ITvInputSession` object, which is then used to invoke the `removeBroadcastInfo` method. This set of instructions forms a potential sink.

Note that the other parts of the code do not form a separate sink because they either involve auxiliary operations (e.g., getting the calling UID and PID) or logging statements, which are excluded according to the negative rules.
