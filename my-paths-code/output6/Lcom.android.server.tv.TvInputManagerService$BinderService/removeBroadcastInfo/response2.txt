To determine the access control level for the `removeBroadcastInfo` method, we should consider the similarities and differences between this method and the provided similar APIs, as well as the nature of its interactions.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: 
   - The `requestBroadcastInfo` and `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` methods have been identified as similar, with access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to broadcast info management are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.
   - These methods interact with session states and perform actions on sessions (e.g., requesting broadcast info, notifying about broadcast info responses), which implies handling potentially sensitive data or capabilities.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `removeBroadcastInfo` method interacts with a `TvInputManagerService$SessionState`, attempting to remove broadcast information. This operation could be considered sensitive because it affects the state of TV input sessions.
   - It checks for the existence of an `ITvInputSession` before proceeding, which is similar to the pattern seen in the provided similar APIs. If such a session exists, it calls `removeBroadcastInfo` on it.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Given that both similar APIs (`requestBroadcastInfo` and `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse`) are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically denotes either system-level or signature-level access control (meaning the calling app must be signed with the same certificate as the app defining the permission, or it must be a system app), we can infer that operations on broadcast information are protected at this level.
   - The nature of `removeBroadcastInfo` suggests it deals with sensitive session management and thus likely requires protection against arbitrary access.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the similarities in functionality and the need to protect such operations from unauthorized access, it's reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `removeBroadcastInfo`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the nature of the method itself, the final access control level for the `removeBroadcastInfo` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This classification reflects the sensitive nature of managing broadcast information within TV input sessions, aligning with the protection levels observed in similar APIs.
