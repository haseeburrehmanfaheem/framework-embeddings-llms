To assign an access control level to the `getBlockedRatings` method, let's analyze its interactions and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Interactions with Sinks**: The `getBlockedRatings` method interacts with sinks related to user state management (`TvInputManagerService$UserState`) and persistent data storage (`PersistentDataStore`). These interactions involve retrieving user states and loading data from persistent storage, which are similar to the operations performed by the provided APIs (`setParentalControlsEnabled` and `removeBlockedRating`).

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **`setParentalControlsEnabled(ZI)V`**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It interacts with `PersistentDataStore`, loading data, which is a similar operation to what is found in the `getBlockedRatings` method.
   - **`removeBlockedRating(Ljava/lang/String;I)V`**: Also has an access control level of `NONE`. It involves creating a new user state and putting it into `mUserStates`, similar to operations within `getBlockedRatings`.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the similarities in operations (interacting with user states and persistent data storage) and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that `getBlockedRatings` does not perform actions that would require elevated permissions or pose significant risks.
   - The method seems to be focused on retrieving information rather than modifying system settings or accessing sensitive data that would necessitate a higher access control level (`NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`).

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of its interactions and comparison with similar APIs, the `getBlockedRatings` method appears to not require special permissions or pose significant security risks. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `NONE` to this method.
