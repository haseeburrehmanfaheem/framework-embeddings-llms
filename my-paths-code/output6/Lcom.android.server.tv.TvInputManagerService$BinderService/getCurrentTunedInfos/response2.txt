Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getCurrentTunedInfos` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getCurrentTunedInfos` method has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve retrieving the user state locked using `TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2)`. This suggests that the method is interacting with sensitive data related to TV input management.

The similar APIs provided, `isSingleSessionActive(I)Z`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` class and use the `getUserStateLocked(p2)` method. The similarity in code structure and functionality between these APIs and `getCurrentTunedInfos` suggests that they are related and may require similar access control levels.

However, it's essential to consider the context and potential risks associated with the `getCurrentTunedInfos` method. Since it retrieves a list of current tuned infos, it may expose sensitive information about the TV input state. In this case, assigning an access control level of `NONE` might not be suitable, as it could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Considering the similarities with the provided APIs and the potential risks associated with the method, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getCurrentTunedInfos` method. This level suggests that the method requires some level of access control, but it is not as sensitive as methods that require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
