To determine the access control level for the `startRecording` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `startRecording` method has a high similarity score with two other APIs: `stopRecording` (similarity score: 0.9824406504631042) and `setCaptionEnabled` (similarity score: 0.9224242568016052). Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The code snippet for `startRecording` shows that it interacts with the `ActivityManager` to handle incoming users, retrieves a session state, and gets a session locked using `TvInputManagerService`. It then calls the `startRecording` method on the `ITvInputSession` object.

The sink code for `startRecording` highlights the key interactions:
1. `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`: This line is also present in both similar APIs (`stopRecording` and `setCaptionEnabled`) with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
2. `TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked` and `TvInputManagerService.getSessionLocked`: These are used to retrieve and lock a session state, which is also similar to the operations performed by the other two APIs.
3. `ITvInputSession.startRecording`: This is the primary action of the method, which starts recording on the TV input session.

Given these similarities in code structure, interactions with system services, and the actions performed, it's reasonable to conclude that the `startRecording` method should have a similar access control level as its highly similar counterparts, `stopRecording` and `setCaptionEnabled`, which are both classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the access control level for the `startRecording` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
