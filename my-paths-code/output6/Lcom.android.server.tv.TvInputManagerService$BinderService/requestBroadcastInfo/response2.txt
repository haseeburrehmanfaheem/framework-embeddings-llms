To assign an access control level to the `requestBroadcastInfo` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `requestBroadcastInfo` method interacts with the `TvInputManagerService` and `ITvInputSession` classes, which are related to TV input management. The method retrieves the calling UID and PID, handles incoming user requests, and gets or creates a user state locked object. It then checks if an `ITvInputSession` object is null before calling its `requestBroadcastInfo` method.

The similar APIs provided, `removeBroadcastInfo` and `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with TV input management classes and have similar code patterns, such as retrieving session states and calling methods on session objects.

Given the similarities in code patterns and the interaction with TV input management classes, it is likely that the `requestBroadcastInfo` method requires a similar access control level to ensure proper authorization and security.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `requestBroadcastInfo` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permission to execute, ensuring that only authorized components can access TV input management functionality.
