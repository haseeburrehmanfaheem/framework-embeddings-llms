To determine the access control level for the `isSingleSessionActive` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `isSingleSessionActive` method interacts with the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` class, which is also used in the similar APIs. The method checks if there is a single active session for a given user, and it does not modify any sensitive data or perform any dangerous operations.

Comparing the code of `isSingleSessionActive` with the similar APIs, we can see that:

* The `getBlockedRatings` API has an access control level of `NONE`, and its code is similar to `isSingleSessionActive`. Both methods interact with the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` class and do not perform any sensitive operations.
* The `removeBlockedRating` API also has an access control level of `NONE`, and its code creates a new instance of `TvInputManagerService$UserState` and puts it in the `mUserStates` map, similar to `isSingleSessionActive`.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the `isSingleSessionActive` method does not require any special access control level, as it does not perform any sensitive or dangerous operations.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarity between the `isSingleSessionActive` method and the provided similar APIs, which have an access control level of `NONE`. The method's code does not indicate any sensitive or dangerous operations that would require a higher access control level.
