To determine the access control level for the `stopRecording` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The `startRecording` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method is similar to `stopRecording` with a high similarity score of 0.9824406504631042. Both methods interact with `ITvInputSession` and perform operations related to recording, suggesting they might require similar permissions or access controls.
   - The `removeOverlayView` method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, with a slightly lower similarity score of 0.9272373914718628 compared to `stopRecording`. This method interacts with the same service and session management as `stopRecording`, indicating similar security requirements.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet for `stopRecording` shows it involves getting the calling UID and PID, handling incoming user operations, and interacting with a session state locked by the TvInputManagerService. It then calls `stopRecording` on an `ITvInputSession` object.
   - The sink code further emphasizes interactions with session states and `ITvInputSession`, which are critical for managing TV input sessions.

3. **Access Control Considerations:**
   - Given that both similar APIs (`startRecording` and `removeOverlayView`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it suggests that operations related to TV input sessions and recording require system or signature-level permissions. This is likely due to the sensitive nature of these operations, which could impact system functionality or user data.
   - The involvement of `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` and session locking mechanisms indicates a need for controlled access to prevent unauthorized modifications or interruptions to TV input sessions.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `stopRecording` method should have a similar access control level to its counterparts due to the nature of its operations and interactions with system services.

**Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision aligns with the security requirements implied by the similar APIs and the method's functionality within the context of TV input session management.
