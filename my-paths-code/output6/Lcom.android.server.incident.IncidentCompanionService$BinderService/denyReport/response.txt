After analyzing the provided paths for the `denyReport` API with depth 2, I've identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. Here's the result in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "PendingReports v3 = this.mPendingReports;",
            "Iterator v9 = this.mPending.iterator();",
            "v9.remove();"
        ],
        [
            "Uri v6 = Uri.parse(p1);",
            "String v7 = v6.getQueryParameter(\"id\");",
            "int v8 = Integer.parseInt(v7);",
            "if (PendingReports$PendingReportRec.id != v8) {"
        ],
        [
            "PendingReports$PendingReportRec v5 = v11;",
            "if (v5 != 0) {",
            "int v14 = PendingReports.getAndValidateUser();",
            "ComponentName v15 = PendingReports.getApproverComponent(v14);",
            "PendingReports.sendBroadcast(v15, v14);"
        ],
        [
            "PendingReports$PendingReportRec.listener.onReportDenied();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

In this JSON output:

1. The first sink set is related to the modification of `this.mPending` through `v9.remove()`, which has naming similarity with the API name and modifies data based on the API parameters.
2. The second sink set involves the parsing of the input parameter `p1` using `Uri.parse(p1)` and extracting a query parameter, which is then used for comparison and decision-making within the API.
3. The third sink set includes method invocations that have naming similarity with the API name or take the input parameters as arguments (indirectly through `v14`). It also involves sending a broadcast based on user validation, which is a significant operation related to the API's purpose.
4. The fourth sink set involves notifying a listener about report denial, which could potentially be a sensitive action depending on the context and implementation of `PendingReports$PendingReportRec.listener.onReportDenied()`.

These sets are ranked from most sensitive (direct data modification and significant method invocations) to less sensitive (notification callbacks), considering their potential impact on system state or security.
