To determine the access control level for the `getPendingReports` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs, `denyReport` and `approveReport`, along with their access control levels.

1. **Analysis of getPendingReports**:
   - The method retrieves a list of pending reports from `this.mPendingReports`.
   - It iterates over the size of `this.mPending` to create an `ArrayList` but doesn't directly manipulate or expose sensitive data outside its scope.
   - The primary operation is reading and returning data without modifying it, which suggests it does not pose a significant risk in terms of data privacy or security.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **denyReport**: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and involves removing items from the pending reports based on specific conditions. Despite its ability to modify data, it's classified as `NONE`, indicating that the modification is likely within the scope of the application's intended functionality and doesn't expose sensitive information or pose a significant security risk.
   - **approveReport**: Similar to `denyReport`, this method also modifies pending reports but is categorized under `NONE`. The modification involves parsing and comparing IDs, which seems to be an internal operation without direct external exposure.

3. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Given that both comparison methods (`denyReport` and `approveReport`) are classified as `NONE`, we can infer that operations related to managing or accessing pending reports do not inherently require elevated access control levels unless they directly expose sensitive information, modify system settings, or pose a significant security risk.
   - The `getPendingReports` method, by returning a list of pending reports without any indication of modifying system settings, exposing sensitive data, or performing dangerous operations, aligns with the behavior of methods categorized as `NONE`.

Based on this analysis and comparison, it's reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `getPendingReports` method should also be `NONE`, as it does not perform any operations that would necessitate a higher level of access control.
