To assign an access control level to the `deleteIncidentReports` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `deleteIncidentReports` method interacts with the `IIncidentManager` service, which is obtained through the `ServiceManager`. This service is used to delete incident reports. The method takes three string parameters (`p1`, `p2`, and `p3`) and checks their lengths before calling the `deleteIncidentReports` method on the `IIncidentManager` instance.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `deleteAllIncidentReports(Ljava/lang/String;)V` with an access control level of `NONE`. This method also interacts with the `IIncidentManager` service, but it deletes all incident reports for a given string parameter.
2. `getIncidentReport(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Landroid/os/IncidentManager$IncidentReport;` with an access control level of `NONE`. This method retrieves an incident report based on three string parameters.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require any specific permissions or access controls to execute. The `deleteIncidentReports` method has a similar interaction with the `IIncidentManager` service, and its functionality is related to deleting incident reports.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `deleteIncidentReports` method, as it does not appear to require any specific permissions or access controls to execute.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
