To determine the access control level for the `notifyEvent` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs. The provided code snippets show that `notifyEvent` performs several actions:

1.  It creates a new instance of `SearchUiManagerService$SearchUiManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3`, passing parameters `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
2.  It retrieves an object from `sLocalServiceObjects` using the key `ActivityManagerInterna.class`.
3.  It gets the calling process ID (`v6`) and user ID (`v7`) using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`, respectively.
4.  It calls `handleIncomingUser` on the retrieved object, passing in the calling process ID, user ID, and other parameters to obtain a new user ID (`v9`).
5.  It checks if the obtained user ID is temporary using `ServiceNameResolver.isTemporary`.
6.  If the user ID is temporary, it performs additional checks and calls `getServiceForUserLocked` on `this$0`, passing in the obtained user ID to get an instance of `AbstractPerUserSystemService`.
7.  Finally, it calls the `accept` method on the created lambda instance (`v1`), passing in the retrieved `AbstractPerUserSystemService` instance.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs perform comparable actions:

*   They create a new instance of a lambda class (`SearchUiManagerService$SearchUiManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda1`) with parameters.
*   They retrieve an object from `sLocalServiceObjects` using the same key as in `notifyEvent`.
*   They call `handleIncomingUser` and obtain a user ID, which is then used to get an instance of `AbstractPerUserSystemService` using `getServiceForUserLocked`.
*   They call the `accept` method on the created lambda instance.

Given these similarities, it appears that `notifyEvent` follows the same pattern as the provided similar APIs. The main difference lies in the specific lambda class and parameters used, but the overall logic remains comparable.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the access control level for `notifyEvent` should be consistent with the similar APIs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }}$
