To determine the access control level for the `destroySearchSession` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of these APIs.

1. **Similarity with `destroySmartspaceSession`**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9669092297554016) with `destroySearchSession`, and it is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippets show that both methods interact with `AbstractPerUserSystemService` in a similar manner, suggesting that they might require similar access control levels due to their similar functionality and potential impact on the system.

2. **Similarity with `registerUiTranslationStateCallback`**: This API has a lower similarity score (0.9053054451942444) compared to `destroySmartspaceSession`, and it is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Although the similarity score is still relatively high, indicating some level of functional or structural similarity, the difference in access control levels between this API and `destroySmartspaceSession` suggests that the specific functionality and system interactions (e.g., the type of service or data being accessed) might play a crucial role in determining the appropriate access control level.

Considering these points:

- The high similarity with `destroySmartspaceSession`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggests that `destroySearchSession` could also require a significant level of access control due to its potential system impact.
- The interaction with `AbstractPerUserSystemService` and the use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `handleIncomingUser` indicate that the method is designed to handle user-specific services securely, which aligns more closely with the need for higher access control (like `SYS_OR_SIG`) rather than no control (`NONE`).

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for the `destroySearchSession` method seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`, reflecting its similarity in functionality and potential system impact to `destroySmartspaceSession`, and acknowledging the method's interactions with sensitive system services.
