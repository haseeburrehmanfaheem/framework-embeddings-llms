To determine the access control level for the `denyWirelessDebugging` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `denyWirelessDebugging` method checks if `this.mDebuggingManager` is 0, and if so, it sends an empty message with code 19 via `this.mHandler`. This action seems to be related to managing or controlling a debugging feature over wireless connectivity.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves sending an empty message (`sendEmptyMessage(19)`) through a handler (`this.mHandler`). This operation is internal and does not directly interact with external entities but is crucial for the method's functionality, likely triggering other parts of the system to perform actions related to disabling wireless debugging.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `enablePairingByPairingCode()V` has a similarity score of 0.9858300089836121 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It sends a message with code 15, which suggests it's involved in pairing operations.
   - `disablePairing()V` has a similarity score of 0.9843387603759766 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It sends a message with code 14, indicating its role in disabling pairing.

Both similar APIs have been assigned the SYS_OR_SIG access control level, suggesting that operations related to pairing and potentially debugging or connectivity management are considered sensitive enough to require system or signature-level permissions. Given the high similarity scores between these methods and `denyWirelessDebugging`, it's reasonable to infer that `denyWirelessDebugging` also deals with sensitive functionality related to device security or privacy.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and especially the similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, `denyWirelessDebugging` likely requires a comparable level of access control due to its involvement in managing wireless debugging, which could impact device security or privacy. Therefore, assigning it an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG seems appropriate.
