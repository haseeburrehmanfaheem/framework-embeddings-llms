To determine the access control level for the `isAdbWifiQrSupported` method, let's analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar API, `removeWeakEscrowToken(JI)Z`.

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The `isAdbWifiQrSupported` method checks if certain system features are supported by the device. These features include WiFi (`android.hardware.wifi`), Ethernet (`android.hardware.ethernet`), and camera capabilities (`android.hardware.camera.any`). 
   - It uses the `PackageManager` to query these system features, which is a common approach in Android for determining hardware capabilities.

2. **Comparison with Similar API**:
   - The similar API, `removeWeakEscrowToken(JI)Z`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that it requires either system-level permission or signature-level permission to execute.
   - This API checks for the presence of a specific system feature (`android.hardware.type.automotive`), which is related to automotive devices.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both APIs interact with system features using `PackageManager`, they share similarities in how they query device capabilities.
   - The `isAdbWifiQrSupported` method, however, does not seem to handle sensitive data or actions that would typically require dangerous permissions (like accessing external storage, contacts, etc.) directly. It's more about checking the availability of certain hardware features.
   - Considering the nature of the query (checking for system features) and comparing it with the `removeWeakEscrowToken(JI)Z` API, which requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control due to its specific use case related to automotive devices, we might infer that checking for WiFi, Ethernet, or camera capabilities is less sensitive but still significant.
   - Since this method does not directly deal with user data or dangerous operations (in terms of Android's permission model), it doesn't clearly fit into the `DANGEROUS` category. However, given its system-oriented query nature and considering how similar APIs are treated (`SYS_OR_SIG` for a more specific automotive feature check), we need to consider if it requires special permissions or not.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that this method checks for hardware features without directly accessing sensitive user data or performing dangerous operations, but still interacts with system capabilities, the access control level should reflect its need for potentially privileged information about the device.
   - The `NORMAL` access control level typically applies to APIs that do not deal with sensitive user data or actions considered dangerous by Android. Given the method's functionality and the comparison with a similar API requiring `SYS_OR_SIG`, if we were to choose among the provided options (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), `NORMAL` seems like an appropriate choice because it does not handle sensitive data directly but still requires some level of system information access.

However, considering the structure and the fact that it's querying system features which might be considered more in line with system or signature-level checks (especially when comparing to how other similar methods are treated), a strong case could also be made for `SYS_OR_SIG` if we consider the implications of needing to know specific hardware capabilities as somewhat privileged. 

Given the information and focusing strictly on the choices provided, without explicit evidence that this method handles sensitive data or requires direct user intervention (dangerous permissions), but recognizing it does interact with system-level features:

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
Or, considering a more conservative approach based on system feature queries and comparisons:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

For the purpose of this exercise and based on the analysis provided, I would lean towards `NORMAL` given the direct information available, but acknowledge that without explicit policy or additional context, `SYS_OR_SIG` could also be justified.
