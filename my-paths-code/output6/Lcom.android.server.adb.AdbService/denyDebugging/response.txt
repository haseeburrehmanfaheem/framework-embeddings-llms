Based on the provided code snippet, here's the analysis:

The given API `denyDebugging` does not follow any of the positive rules that indicate potential sinks. 

There is no method invocation with naming similarity to the API name or taking input parameters as arguments. 
There are no field get cases with naming similarity to the API name.
There are no field set cases with naming similarity to the API name or modified with API parameters.
There is no creation of new objects with naming similarity to the API or created with data flow from the API parameters.

The `mHandler.sendEmptyMessage(4)` call can be considered a generic utility method, and thus follows one of the negative rules. 

Therefore, this code snippet does not contain any potential sinks that require access control.
