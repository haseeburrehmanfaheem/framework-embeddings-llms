To determine the access control level for the `clearDebuggingKeys` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `clearDebuggingKeys` method checks if `this.mDebuggingManager` equals 0 and then sends an empty message with code 6 via `this.mHandler`. This action suggests a specific handling or signaling within the application that is likely related to debugging purposes.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves sending an empty message with a specific code (6) through a handler (`this.mHandler`). This operation implies communication within the application's components, possibly triggering actions related to clearing debugging keys.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `enablePairingByPairingCode()V` and `disablePairing()V` have high similarity scores with `clearDebuggingKeys`. Both of these methods are involved in sending empty messages through a handler but with different codes (15 for enabling pairing and 14 for disabling pairing).
   - These similar APIs are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions. This suggests that operations related to pairing and potentially other specific configurations or states within the application are considered sensitive or critical.

Given these points, we can infer the following:
- The operation performed by `clearDebuggingKeys` involves internal signaling that could affect the application's state, specifically regarding debugging.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their potential impact on system or application security and functionality.

Considering these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that `clearDebuggingKeys`, similar to its highly similar counterparts, should also be treated as requiring a significant level of access control due to its implications for the application's state and potentially its security.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
