To determine the access control level for the `suggestExternalTime` method, we should consider the similarity scores and the access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the code snippets.

The `suggestExternalTime` method is very similar to `suggestGnssTime` and `suggestNetworkTime`, with high similarity scores (0.9939203262329102 and 0.9835022687911987, respectively). Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. The code snippets for these APIs also show a similar pattern of creating a synthetic lambda object and posting it to a handler.

Given the high similarity in both code structure and functionality between `suggestExternalTime` and the other two APIs (`suggestGnssTime` and `suggestNetworkTime`), and considering that all interact with the `mHandler.post` method in a similar way without any explicit security or permission checks, it suggests that `suggestExternalTime` does not require special access control.

Therefore, based on the similarity and the lack of explicit security measures in the provided code snippets, the access control level for `suggestExternalTime` should be consistent with its peers.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
