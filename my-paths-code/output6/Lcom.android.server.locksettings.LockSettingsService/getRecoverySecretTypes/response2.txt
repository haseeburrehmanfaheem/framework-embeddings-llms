To determine the access control level for the `getRecoverySecretTypes` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The method interacts with a database, specifically querying the "recovery_service_metadata" table based on user ID and UID. It retrieves data related to secret types for recovery services.

The key aspects of this method include:
1. **Database Interaction**: It reads from the database using `SQLiteDatabase`'s `query` method.
2. **Data Retrieval**: It fetches specific columns ("secret_types") from the query results.
3. **Return Value**: The method returns an array of integers (`[I`) representing secret types.

Comparing this with the similar APIs provided:
- Both similar APIs are named `setRecoverySecretTypes([I)V`, which suggests they are involved in setting or updating recovery secret types, as opposed to getting them.
- These APIs also interact with the "recovery_service_metadata" table but for writing or updating purposes, based on their names and the presence of `set` operations in their code snippets.
- The access control level for these similar APIs is `NONE`, indicating that they do not impose significant restrictions or require special permissions to execute.

Given this context, we can infer the following about `getRecoverySecretTypes`:
- **Data Sensitivity**: While it handles potentially sensitive data (recovery secret types), the method's primary action is retrieval rather than modification.
- **Permission Requirements**: The code does not explicitly check for or require specific permissions beyond what might be inherent in accessing the database.

Based on these observations and considering that similar APIs (`setRecoverySecretTypes`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that `getRecoverySecretTypes` might also not require stringent access controls. However, since it deals with potentially sensitive recovery information, assigning a level of `NONE` could be reasonable if we consider the method's functionality within the context of the provided similar APIs and the nature of its database interactions.

Therefore, considering all factors and for consistency with the provided examples, the final access control level for the `getRecoverySecretTypes` API would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision aligns with the observed patterns in similar APIs and reflects a balanced approach to controlling access to potentially sensitive data without imposing undue restrictions on method functionality.
