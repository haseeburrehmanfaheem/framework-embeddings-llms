To determine the access control level for the `hasPendingEscrowToken` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the sink code it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `hasPendingEscrowToken` method appears to check if there is a pending escrow token for a given integer parameter `p1`. It does this by first checking if the `tokenMap` contains the key `p1`, and if so, it further checks if the set of keys associated with that token is not empty.

The sink code shows interactions with `this.tokenMap.containsKey(v3)` and `this.tokenMap.get(v6)`, indicating that the method is accessing data stored in a map named `tokenMap`.

Comparing this to the similar API `removeWeakEscrowToken(JI)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can observe some similarities:
- Both methods interact with the `tokenMap`.
- The nature of their interaction (checking existence, retrieving values) suggests they handle sensitive data or operations related to escrow tokens.

Given that `removeWeakEscrowToken(JI)Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically implies that the method requires system-level permissions or a signature permission to execute, we can infer that operations involving the `tokenMap` and escrow tokens are considered sensitive. 

However, the `hasPendingEscrowToken` method does not seem to modify any data but rather checks for the existence of certain conditions related to escrow tokens. This is a read operation rather than a write or modify operation.

Considering these points:
- The method's purpose is to check for pending escrow tokens without modifying them.
- It interacts with sensitive data (the `tokenMap`).
- Similar methods that modify this data have a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`).

Given the choices, it seems most appropriate to assign an access control level of `NORMAL` because the method is accessing potentially sensitive information but does not appear to pose as significant a risk as modifying operations would. It's less restrictive than `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` since it doesn't modify data and more controlled than `NONE` given its interaction with what seems to be sensitive token data.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
