Based on the provided code for the `requireStrongAuth` API, we can analyze it to identify potential sinks. The code is as follows:

```java
public void requireStrongAuth(int p1, int p2){
    if (p2 == -1) {
        if (p2 < 0) {
            Message v3 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1, p1, p2);
            v3.sendToTarget();
            return;
        }
    }
}
```

Looking at the code:

- The `if` statements and the condition checks do not directly contribute to a sink as they are part of control flow logic.
- The creation of a new `Message` object (`v3 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1, p1, p2)`) has naming similarity with none of the parameters but is created using dataflow from the API parameters `p1` and `p2`. This follows one of the positive rules for identifying sinks.
- The method invocation on `v3.sendToTarget()` takes the previously created object as an argument (indirectly through its own state) and has a direct link to the creation of `v3`, making it part of the same sink due to data flow.

Given these observations, we can identify one set of instructions that together contribute to a potential sink:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "Message v3 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1, p1, p2);",
            "v3.sendToTarget();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This JSON represents the identified sink where the creation of `v3` and its subsequent method invocation are directly linked through data flow. The API parameters `p1` and `p2` influence the creation of `v3`, making this a coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink according to the provided rules.
