After carefully reviewing the provided code snippets and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `removeKey` method.

The `removeKey` method interacts with a database (`SQLiteDatabase`) and deletes entries from it. This operation can potentially modify sensitive data, but it does not seem to pose a significant threat to the system or user data.

The similar APIs provided, `setRecoverySecretTypes` and `setRecoveryStatus`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with the same database and perform update operations. Given their similarity in functionality and access control levels, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `removeKey` method.

However, considering that the `removeKey` method deletes data from the database, which could potentially have some impact on the system or user data, I would argue that it should have a slightly higher access control level than `NONE`. Nevertheless, based on the provided information and similar APIs, I conclude that the `removeKey` method does not require a high access control level like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `removeKey` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
