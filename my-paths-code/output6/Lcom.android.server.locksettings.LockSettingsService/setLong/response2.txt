To determine the access control level for the `setLong` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `setLong` method writes a long value to storage using `LockSettingsStorage.writeKeyValue(p1, v3, p3)`. This operation involves modifying settings that could potentially be sensitive or restricted, especially considering the check for "cannot store lock settings for FRP user" which implies security-related functionality.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code specifically highlights the lines where a string representation of a long value is created and then written to storage. This action, by itself, does not inherently imply danger but when considered in the context of modifying lock settings or other sensitive configurations, it could have security implications.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `setBoolean` API has an access control level of NONE, which might initially suggest that setting values (in this case, a boolean) is not considered dangerous. However, its similarity score and the operation of writing to storage using `LockSettingsStorage.writeKeyValue` are similar to those in `setLong`.
   - The `getLong` API also has an access control level of NONE. It reads a value from storage instead of writing it, which generally poses less risk than modifying settings.

Given these points, we must consider the context and potential impact of the `setLong` method:
- **Modifying Lock Settings**: The method can modify lock settings, which are security-related and potentially sensitive.
- **FRP User Restriction**: There's a specific check to prevent storing lock settings for FRP (Factory Reset Protection) users, indicating that this operation could have implications on device security or user privacy.

Despite the similar APIs having an access control level of NONE, the context provided by the `setLong` method's functionality—especially its involvement with potentially sensitive lock settings and the specific restriction related to FRP users—suggests a need for caution. However, without explicit indicators of it being "DANGEROUS" (e.g., direct access to highly sensitive data without protection or an ability to cause widespread harm), and considering the provided similar APIs are ranked as NONE, we must balance between security precautions and the method's apparent functionality.

Given that `setLong` deals with potentially sensitive information (lock settings) but through a controlled interface (`LockSettingsStorage.writeKeyValue`), and acknowledging the specific restriction for FRP users which implies some level of access control is already considered within its implementation, the most fitting access control level seems to be "NORMAL". This choice reflects that while the method does interact with security-related settings, it does so in a manner that's controlled and not openly dangerous based on the provided information.
