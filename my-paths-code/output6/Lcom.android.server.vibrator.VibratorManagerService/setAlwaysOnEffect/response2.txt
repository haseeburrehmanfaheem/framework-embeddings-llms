To determine the access control level for the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `setAlwaysOnEffect` method involves several operations:

1.  It checks if the provided `CombinedVibration` effect is valid using `VibratorManagerService.isEffectValid(p4)`.
2.  It creates a new `VibrationAttributes` object based on the provided parameters.
3.  It updates the `mAlwaysOnEffects` map with the new vibration effect.

The sink code snippets indicate that the method accesses and modifies the `mUsage`, `mOriginalAudioUsage`, and `mFlags` fields, which are related to vibration attributes. Additionally, it creates a new `VibratorManagerService$AlwaysOnVibration` object and updates the `mAlwaysOnEffects` map.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

*   The `vibrate` method has a similarity score of 0.8842525482177734 and an access control level of NORMAL. It also checks the validity of the vibration effect using `VibratorManagerService.isEffectValid(p4)`, which is similar to the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method.
*   The `cancelVibrate` method has a similarity score of 0.7229877710342407 and an access control level of NORMAL. Although it performs different operations, it also interacts with vibration-related fields and methods.

Based on these similarities and the fact that the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method modifies system-level vibration settings, we can conclude that its access control level should be NORMAL. This is because it requires some level of protection to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to the system's vibration settings, but it does not pose a significant risk like DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG level operations would.

Here is the final access control level for the `setAlwaysOnEffect` API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision balances the need to protect system resources with the requirement to allow legitimate interactions with the vibration subsystem.
