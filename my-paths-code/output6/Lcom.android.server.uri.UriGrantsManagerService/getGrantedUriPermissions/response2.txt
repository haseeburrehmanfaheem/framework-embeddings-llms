To determine the access control level for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getGrantedUriPermissions` method returns a `ParceledListSlice` containing granted URI permissions based on the input parameters (`String p1` and `int p2`). It initializes an empty `ArrayList`, checks a condition related to `this.mGrantedUriPermissions.size()`, and if the condition is not met, it creates a `ParceledListSlice` from this list and returns it. The key aspect here is that it's dealing with permissions, which are crucial for security and access control.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet shows the initialization of an empty `ArrayList`, creation of a `ParceledListSlice` from this array list, and its return. This doesn't directly interact with sensitive data or operations but is part of managing permission-related information.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **queryPermissionsByGroup**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9339002966880798) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It deals with querying permissions by group, which implies handling permission data.
   - **getAllPermissionGroups**: With a similarity score of 0.9313316941261292, this API also has an access control level of `NONE`. It's involved in retrieving all permission groups.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that their operations are not considered to pose significant security risks or require special permissions.
- The nature of `getGrantedUriPermissions` involves returning information about granted URI permissions, which is related to how applications interact with data and resources on the device. However, based on the code snippet provided, it doesn't seem to perform any operation that would directly affect system security or require elevated privileges.

Considering these points, since the method seems to be involved in managing and retrieving permission information without directly impacting system security or requiring special access rights (based on the given code snippets), the most appropriate access control level for `getGrantedUriPermissions` appears to align with its similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the similarity in functionality and the nature of operations performed by this method compared to other methods with known access control levels.
