To determine the access control level for the `expireRollbackForPackage` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided, specifically looking at their interactions with sinks, assigned access control levels, and semantics.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `expireRollbackForPackage` method creates an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7` with parameters `p0` and `p1`.
   - It then uses a `Handler` to get the associated `Looper`, checks if the current thread is the one associated with this looper, and throws an exception if it's not (indicating that this operation should be performed on a specific thread).
   - The method executes the lambda asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.runAsync` with `this.mExecutor`.
   
2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`reloadPersistedData()` and `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - These APIs also interact with `CompletableFuture` (either `runAsync` for `reloadPersistedData()` or `supplyAsync` for `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()`) and use instances of synthetic lambda classes, similar to the `expireRollbackForPackage` method.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the similarities in code structure and the fact that both provided APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it suggests that operations involving rollback management services require system or signature-level permissions.
   - The use of specific executors and checks for the current thread also imply a need to restrict access to these methods to prevent misuse or unauthorized access.

Based on this analysis, the `expireRollbackForPackage` method should have an access control level similar to its counterparts due to the similarities in their implementation details and the context in which they are used (rollback management services).

**Final Access Control Level**:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination is made considering the need for system or signature-level permissions to safely execute rollback-related operations, aligning with the access control levels of similar APIs provided.
