To identify potential sinks in the provided API `expireRollbackForPackage`, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Method Invocation and Object Creation**: 
   - A new instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7` is created, passing `p0` and `p1` as parameters. This follows the positive rule because it has naming similarity with elements within the API context (considering `p1` as an input parameter) and is created with data flow from the API parameters.
   - The method `RollbackManagerServiceImpl.getHandler()` is invoked, which doesn't directly follow any of the specified rules but is part of the overall data flow.

2. **Field Access and Updates**:
   - `this.mExecutor` is accessed for setting up `CompletableFuture.runAsync(v3, this.mExecutor)`. This doesn't have naming similarity with the API name but does involve using an object that's associated with the execution context of the task defined by `v3`.

3. **Method Invocations**:
   - `v7.getLooper()` and `v8.isCurrentThread()` are method invocations without direct relation to the input parameters or return values in terms of naming similarity or data flow related to `p1`.
   - `CompletableFuture.runAsync(v3, this.mExecutor)` involves executing a task asynchronously, which takes the previously created object as an argument. This has a connection through the data flow from creating `v3`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The method doesn't return any value (`void`), so there's no direct return of sensitive information based on the provided rules.

Given these points, we can see that there is a coherent set of instructions related to the creation and execution of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7`, which involves data flow from the input parameter `p1`. 

Here is the JSON representation of identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7 v3 = new RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7(p0,p1);",
      "CompletableFuture v11 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(v3, this.mExecutor);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This sink involves the creation of an object with data flow from the API parameter `p1` and its subsequent execution in an asynchronous context. The other parts of the code involve auxiliary operations or logging/validation checks that don't directly contribute to potential sinks based on the provided rules.
