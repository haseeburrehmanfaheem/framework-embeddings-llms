To determine the access control level for the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method, let's analyze the information provided.

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `getAvailableRollbacks()`: This API has a high similarity score (0.9968241453170776) with `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `reloadPersistedData()`: Although the similarity score (0.970863938331604) is slightly lower than that of `getAvailableRollbacks`, it's still significantly high, and its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Code Semantics:**
   - The code snippet for `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` involves checking the current thread state, enforcing manage rollbacks permission (`p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks");`), and executing a task asynchronously using `CompletableFuture`. This suggests that it's interacting with system-level functionality that requires specific permissions.
   - The enforcement of `manageRollbacks` permission indicates that this method is dealing with sensitive operations related to rollbacks, which typically require elevated or specific access rights.

3. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   - The sink code involves creating a lambda instance (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8`) and executing it asynchronously. This asynchronous execution pattern, combined with the permission enforcement, suggests that the method is handling tasks that should be restricted to certain processes or threads for security and stability reasons.

Given these points:

- **Similarity in Code and Purpose:** The high similarity scores and identical access control levels of similar APIs suggest a consistent security requirement.
- **Permission Enforcement:** The explicit permission check (`enforceManageRollbacks`) implies that the method is performing actions that require specific, possibly elevated permissions.
- **Asynchronous Execution:** This pattern indicates handling of tasks that should be managed carefully, potentially requiring system or signature-level access control to prevent misuse.

**Conclusion:**

Given the high similarity with other APIs that have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels and considering the method's interaction with sensitive rollback management functionality, it is reasonable to conclude that `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` should also have a similar access control level to ensure consistency in security and permission handling.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
