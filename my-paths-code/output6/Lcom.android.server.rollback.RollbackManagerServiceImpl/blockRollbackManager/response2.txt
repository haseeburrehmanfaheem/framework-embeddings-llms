To determine the access control level for the `blockRollbackManager` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `blockRollbackManager` method posts a runnable (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda13`) to a handler (`this.mHandler`), which suggests that it interacts with some internal mechanism for managing rollbacks. This interaction could potentially affect system stability or data integrity.

Looking at the similar APIs:
- The `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also involves posting a runnable to a handler, similar to `blockRollbackManager`.
- The `expireRollbackForPackage` API, with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, uses `CompletableFuture.runAsync` to execute a task asynchronously. While the execution mechanism differs slightly from posting to a handler, both methods facilitate asynchronous operations that could impact system or application states.

Given these similarities and considering the potential impact on system or application stability:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions.
- The operations performed by these APIs (and by extension, `blockRollbackManager`) are significant enough to warrant protection against arbitrary access.

Therefore, based on the code and the access control levels of similar APIs, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `blockRollbackManager`.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
