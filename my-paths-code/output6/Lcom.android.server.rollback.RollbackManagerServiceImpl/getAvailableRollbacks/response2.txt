To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableRollbacks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `getAvailableRollbacks` checks if the current thread is not the same as the handler's looper thread using `Preconditions.checkState((v4 ^ 1))`. This suggests that it enforces execution on a specific thread, possibly to prevent concurrent modifications or ensure sequential access.
   - It calls `p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getAvailableRollbacks")`, indicating some form of permission check related to managing rollbacks. The specifics of this enforcement are not detailed in the snippet but imply an access control mechanism.
   - The method uses `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` with an executor, which is a common pattern for asynchronous programming. This does not directly influence access control decisions but indicates that the operation might be time-consuming or resource-intensive.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves creating an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12`, passing it to `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync`, and then getting the result from the future. This asynchronous execution pattern is consistent with the method's body but does not provide additional insights into access control.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` and `notifyStagedSession`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 
   - The code for these methods shows a similar pattern of using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` and enforcing some form of state or permission check (though the specifics can vary).
   - The high similarity scores suggest that these APIs are closely related in terms of functionality and possibly share common implementation details, including access control mechanisms.

Given this analysis, the `getAvailableRollbacks` method seems to follow a pattern similar to its peer methods within the same functional domain. It enforces specific execution conditions (thread checks) and permissions (`enforceManageRollbacks`), which are indicators of controlled access. The use of asynchronous programming does not inherently dictate an access control level but suggests that the operation's outcome is significant enough to warrant careful handling.

Considering these points, especially the high similarity with other APIs labeled as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getAvailableRollbacks` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects its need for system or signature-level protection, aligning with the observed patterns in similar methods.
