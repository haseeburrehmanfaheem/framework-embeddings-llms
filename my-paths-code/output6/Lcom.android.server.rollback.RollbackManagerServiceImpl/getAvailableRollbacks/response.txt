To identify potential sinks in the provided API `getAvailableRollbacks`, we need to analyze the code carefully and apply the given rules.

The API creates a new object of type `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12` and uses it with `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync`. This object is created with data flow from the API's context (`p0`), which suggests that it might be part of a potential sink. Additionally, the return value of the `CompletableFuture` (which is `v16` or `v9`) is returned by the API.

Here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12 v7 = new RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12(p0);",
            "CompletableFuture v15 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(v7, this.mExecutor);",
            "Object v16 = v15.get();",
            "return v9;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

In the above JSON, we have identified one coherent set of instructions that form a potential sink. This set includes the creation of the lambda object `v7`, its use with `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync`, and the return of the result from this future. The output of each instruction directly influences the input or creation of the next, showing a clear data flow link between them.

The instructions listed follow at least one of the positive rules: they are involved in the creation of new objects (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12`) and these objects are used with data flow from the API parameters or context, and their results are returned by the API. 

Note that we exclude generic utility methods (like `getLooper`, `isCurrentThread`, `checkState`), logging statements (there aren't any explicit logs in this snippet but `Preconditions.checkState` could be considered a form of logging or sanity check), and auxiliary operations (like obtaining handlers or looper instances) as per the negative rules provided.
