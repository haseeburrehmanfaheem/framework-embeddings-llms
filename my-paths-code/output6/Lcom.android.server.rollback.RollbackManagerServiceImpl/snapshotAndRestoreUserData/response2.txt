To determine the access control level for the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method posts a `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda14` instance to a handler, which is similar to the `blockRollbackManager` API that posts a `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda13` instance. Both of these methods interact with the same type of handler and use similar lambda instances.

The `expireRollbackForPackage` API, although slightly different in its execution method (using `CompletableFuture.runAsync` instead of `Handler.post`), also deals with a similar lambda instance (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7`) and is related to the management of rollbacks.

Given that both similar APIs (`blockRollbackManager` and `expireRollbackForPackage`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method, which shares similarities with these APIs in terms of its interaction with rollback management mechanisms, should also be assigned a similar access control level.

The reason for assigning `SYS_OR_SIG` to these methods likely stems from their involvement in system-level operations (rollback management) that require either system or signature-level permissions to execute, ensuring that only authorized components can interact with these sensitive functionalities.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the access control levels of the provided APIs, the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
