To determine the access control level for the `notifyStagedSession` method, we should analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `notifyStagedSession` method involves creating a new instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda9`, executing it asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync`, and then retrieving the result. This asynchronous operation is executed on an executor (`this.mExecutor`), which suggests that it might be interacting with system-level resources or performing operations that require specific permissions.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:
- `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()` and `getAvailableRollbacks()` both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also create instances of lambda classes and execute them asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` with `this.mExecutor`, similar to `notifyStagedSession`.

Given the high similarity scores (0.9701103568077087 and 0.9698778986930847) between `notifyStagedSession` and these two APIs, it suggests that `notifyStagedSession` likely interacts with system-level resources or requires similar permissions as these methods.

The key factor here is not just the asynchronous execution but also the context in which these operations are performed and the potential impact on system state. Since both comparison APIs require a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to infer that `notifyStagedSession`, given its similarities in operation and high similarity scores, should also be assigned a similar access control level.

Therefore, considering the execution context, the interaction with potentially sensitive resources via asynchronous operations managed by an executor, and the comparison with highly similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `notifyStagedSession` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
