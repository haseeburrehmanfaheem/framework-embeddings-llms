Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `showToolbar` method.

The `showToolbar` method has two paths with depth 2, and both paths interact with the same sinks as the similar APIs (`hideToolbar` and `dismissToolbar`). The sinks are:

1. `AbstractPerUserSystemService v3 = this.this$0.getServiceForUserLocked(p3);`
2. `RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService v8 = new RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService(v9,v7,AbstractPerUserSystemService.mUserId,this.mRemoteServiceCallback);`

The similar APIs (`hideToolbar` and `dismissToolbar`) have an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not pose a significant security risk.

However, the `showToolbar` method has an additional sink: `int v11 = Binder.getCallingUid();`, which retrieves the UID of the calling process. This could potentially be used to perform privileged actions or access sensitive data.

Despite this, the overall structure and functionality of the `showToolbar` method are similar to those of the `hideToolbar` and `dismissToolbar` methods, which have an access control level of `NONE`. The additional sink related to `Binder.getCallingUid()` does not seem to significantly alter the security posture in a way that would necessitate a higher access control level than `NONE`, given the context provided by the similar APIs.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the similarity with other APIs, the access control level for the `showToolbar` method can be considered as `NONE`.
