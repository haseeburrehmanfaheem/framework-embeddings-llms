To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The given code snippet for the `onReceive` method creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing parameters to its constructor, and then starts it. This action does not directly indicate a dangerous operation such as accessing sensitive user data, making financial transactions, or performing system-level modifications that would typically require higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**: The provided similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. These similar APIs perform essentially the same operation as the method in question: they create an instance of a class (in this case, `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`) and start it. The similarity in both code structure and assigned access control levels suggests that these operations are considered safe or not sensitive enough to warrant stricter access controls.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - **NONE**: Typically used for methods that do not pose a risk to user data or device security.
   - **NORMAL**: Used for methods that require some level of permission but are generally not as risky as those categorized under `DANGEROUS`.
   - **DANGEROUS**: Applies to methods that can significantly impact user privacy or device security, such as accessing location data, contacts, or making calls/send SMS.
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: Reserved for system-level operations or those that require signature-level permissions, which are more restrictive.

Given the information and analysis:
- The `onReceive` method does not appear to perform any operations that would be classified as dangerous or requiring system-level access based on the provided code snippet and similar APIs.
- All similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating their operations are not deemed sensitive.

Therefore, considering the lack of evidence suggesting the `onReceive` method poses a risk to user data or device security, and based on the similarities with other methods that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for this API should also be `NONE`.
