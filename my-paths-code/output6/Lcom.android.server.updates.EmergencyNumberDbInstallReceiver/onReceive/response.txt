To analyze this code snippet as per your instructions:

```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p1,p2);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```

First, let's break down the execution flow and identify potential sinks based on the positive rules provided:

1. **Method Invocation**: The `start()` method is invoked on an object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. This does not directly have naming similarity with the API name `onReceive`, but it does process data that includes parameters passed to `onReceive`.

2. **Object Creation**: An instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created, passing `p0`, `p1`, and `p2` as arguments. The creation of this object has a direct data flow link with the parameters of the `onReceive` method.

Considering these points, we can identify a potential sink set that involves the creation of the `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object and its subsequent use (invocation of `start()`). This adheres to the positive rule regarding object creation with data flow from API parameters.

Here is how you could represent this in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p1,p2);",
            "v1.start();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This sink set is ranked based on its sensitivity and the direct data flow from the API's parameters to the creation and use of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. Since there are no other identified sinks in this snippet, it stands alone in the ranking.
