To determine the access control level for the `getActiveProjectionInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getActiveProjectionInfo` method checks if `v2` is not equal to 0 and then proceeds to check if `this.mProjectionGrant` is not equal to 0.
   - If both conditions are met, it calls `this.mProjectionGrant.getProjectionInfo()` to retrieve the `MediaProjectionInfo`.
   - The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` to manage the calling identity temporarily. This suggests that the method is interacting with system-level components or services.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code primarily focuses on retrieving and returning `MediaProjectionInfo` from `this.mProjectionGrant`.
   - It involves basic variable assignments but no explicit operations that would directly indicate a specific access control level based solely on the provided snippet.

3. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The similar API, `createProjection`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that it requires either system or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - The code for `createProjection` involves checking if an application is privileged and creating a new `MediaProjectionManagerService$MediaProjection` object. It interacts with sensitive information like application privileges and media projection services.

Given the analysis:

- **Interaction with System Components**: Both the original method and its similar API interact with system-level components or services, indicating a need for some level of access control.
- **Permission Requirements**: The `createProjection` API requires `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions, which implies that operations related to media projection management are considered sensitive.
- **Sensitive Information Access**: The methods deal with accessing and managing media projections, which can be considered sensitive operations as they might involve user data or system resources.

Based on the similarity in functionality and interaction with system services, it's reasonable to infer that `getActiveProjectionInfo` would require a similar level of access control. Since it interacts with system components (like retrieving projection info) but does not explicitly show dangerous operations like writing to external storage or sending SMS (which are typically classified as `DANGEROUS`), and given the context provided by the similar API, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because it involves system-level interactions that are likely privileged.

**Access Control Level Decision**:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision aligns with the need for either system or signature-level permissions when interacting with sensitive media projection services and information, as suggested by the analysis of both the method's code snippet and its similar API.
