To determine the access control level for the `stopActiveProjection` method, let's analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Both paths in `stopActiveProjection` involve checking if a media projection is valid (`this.this$0.isValidMediaProjection(v8)`) and interact with AppOpsManager to check or set modes related to operations (specifically, operation 24, which seems related to managing media projections).
   - The method also involves stopping a projection and handling callbacks, which suggests it deals with system-level functionality that could impact other apps or the system itself.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `setContentRecordingSession` has an access control level of `NONE`. This API is similar in that it validates a media projection but seems to focus on setting up content recording sessions without directly manipulating app ops or projection states at a system level.
   - `createProjection` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission. This method creates a new media projection, which involves more critical operations like checking privileged apps and creating new projection instances.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `stopActiveProjection` deals with stopping active projections, which can impact the system state and potentially other applications, it suggests a need for a certain level of access control.
   - The interaction with `AppOpsManager` to check and set operation modes (specifically for stopping media projections) implies that this method performs actions that could be sensitive or require specific permissions.
   - Comparing with `createProjection`, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to its system-impacting nature, `stopActiveProjection` seems less about creating new critical system states but more about managing existing ones. However, it still deals with potentially sensitive operations like stopping projections and handling app ops.

Considering these points, while `stopActiveProjection` is involved in managing system-level resources (media projections) and interacts with sensitive APIs (`AppOpsManager`), its actions seem more aligned with managing or stopping ongoing processes rather than creating new ones with potential broader system impacts. Thus, it might not require the highest level of access control like `SYS_OR_SIG` but does require more than `NONE`.

Given the options:
- `NONE`: Too permissive for an operation that interacts with system-level functionalities.
- `NORMAL`: Could be a fit as it suggests some level of access control without requiring system or signature permissions.
- `DANGEROUS`: Might be too restrictive unless stopping projections is considered highly sensitive, which seems less likely compared to creating them.
- `SYS_OR_SIG`: Typically required for operations that significantly impact the system or require high-level permissions, which might not align perfectly with stopping an existing projection.

The final access control level decision for `stopActiveProjection` should balance between the need for some form of permission or access control and the nature of its operations. Given it's less about creating new projections (which requires `SYS_OR_SIG`) and more about managing existing system states, but still involves system-level operations:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice reflects a balance between security considerations and the operational requirements of stopping active media projections, acknowledging that while it's an important system function, it may not necessitate the highest levels of access control.
