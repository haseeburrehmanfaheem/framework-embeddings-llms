To determine the access control level for the `submitFromAshmem` API, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - Both similar APIs (`isEnabled()` and `suggestScratchSize()`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that interactions with the `IGsiService` interface, at least for these specific methods, do not require elevated permissions.

2. **Code Semantics of Similar APIs**:
   - The code snippets for both similar APIs involve creating a proxy to interact with the `IGsiService` and then calling a method on this service (`isGsiEnabled()` or `suggestScratchSize()`). This pattern is consistent with the `submitFromAshmem` API, which also creates a proxy to call `commitGsiChunkFromAshmem(p1)`.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code provided involves creating an `IGsiService$Stub$Proxy` instance and using it to call `commitGsiChunkFromAshmem(p1)`. This operation is similar in nature to the operations performed by the similar APIs, which also interact with the `IGsiService` through a proxy.

4. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the consistency in how these APIs (including `submitFromAshmem`) interact with the `IGsiService`, it suggests that the operations performed by these APIs might not require special permissions or pose significant risks that would necessitate higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The primary interaction is with a service interface (`IGsiService`) which itself might handle necessary permissions and security checks internally.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the similarity in code structure, the operations performed, and the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `submitFromAshmem` API would also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because its interactions with the system (through the `IGsiService`) are consistent with other APIs that do not require elevated permissions.

**Final Access Control Level**:
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
This conclusion assumes that the internal implementation of `commitGsiChunkFromAshmem` within the `IGsiService` handles any necessary security and permission checks, consistent with the pattern observed in similar APIs.
