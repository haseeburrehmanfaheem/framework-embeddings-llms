To determine the access control level for the `getInstallationProgress` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: All three paths for `getInstallationProgress` involve interacting with a service ("gsiservice") to retrieve the installation progress. They use `ServiceManager.waitForService("gsiservice")` to get an `IBinder`, then query the local interface for "android.gsi.IGsiService", and finally call `getInstallProgress()` on the service proxy.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet is essentially about creating a proxy for `IGsiService` and calling `getInstallProgress()` on it, which aligns with the logic in all paths of `getInstallationProgress`.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `abort()Z`: This method has an access control level of NONE. It interacts with the same service ("gsiservice") but calls `cancelGsiInstall()` instead.
   - `finishInstallation()Z`: Also has an access control level of NONE. It too interacts with "gsiservice" but calls `closeInstall()`.

Given these observations:

- All methods (`getInstallationProgress`, `abort()Z`, and `finishInstallation()Z`) interact with the "gsiservice" in a similar manner, using its interface to perform different actions.
- The access control levels for `abort()Z` and `finishInstallation()Z` are both NONE, suggesting that interacting with "gsiservice" in this context does not require elevated permissions or special access controls.

Considering these points, the logical conclusion is that `getInstallationProgress`, which also interacts with "gsiservice" but only to retrieve information (installation progress), should have a similar access control level to its counterparts. Since both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE and given the nature of `getInstallationProgress` does not imply any dangerous or system/signature-level operations, it is reasonable to conclude that `getInstallationProgress` also requires no special permissions.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
