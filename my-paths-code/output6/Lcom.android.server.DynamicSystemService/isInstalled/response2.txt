To determine the access control level for the `isInstalled` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The `isInstalled` method checks if an image is installed by reading a system property "gsid.image_installed" using `SystemProperties.getBoolean`. This operation does not seem to pose any significant security risk or require special permissions since it's just reading a boolean value indicating the installation status of an image.

Looking at the similar API, `isInUse()Z`, which has a high similarity score of 0.9161214828491211, we see that its access control level is `NONE`. This method also reads a system property ("ro.gsid.image_running") to check if an image is in use, which is analogous to what `isInstalled` does but for a different purpose (checking installation status versus checking usage status). Both methods involve reading system properties without modifying them or accessing sensitive data that would require higher levels of access control.

Given the similarity in functionality and the nature of the operation (reading system properties), and considering that these operations do not pose a significant security risk, it's reasonable to conclude that the `isInstalled` method should have an access control level similar to that of `isInUse()Z`, which is `NONE`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `isInstalled` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
