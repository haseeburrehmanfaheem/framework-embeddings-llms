To assign an access control level to the `isCredentialSharableWithParent` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `isCredentialSharableWithParent` method has three paths with depth 2, but they all seem to be identical. The method calls `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` to get a `UserInfo` object, then retrieves a `UserTypeDetails` object from a map using the user type as the key. It then checks if the user is a profile and if their credentials are sharable with the parent.

The sink code includes four lines:
1. `UserInfo v4 = UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1);`
2. `Object v5 = this.mUserTypes.get(v3);`
3. `boolean v6 = v2.isProfile();`
4. `boolean v7 = v2.isCredentialSharableWithParent();`

The similar APIs are:
- `isMediaSharedWithParent(I)Z` with a similarity score of 0.9465248584747314 and an access control level of NONE.
- `hasBadge(I)Z` with a similarity score of 0.9255135655403137 and an access control level of NONE.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, indicating that they do not pose a significant security risk. The `isMediaSharedWithParent` method has a high similarity score and also interacts with the same sinks (e.g., `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` and `this.mUserTypes.get(v3)`), which suggests that it is likely to have a similar access control level.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the `isCredentialSharableWithParent` method is unlikely to pose a significant security risk and should have an access control level of NONE.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
