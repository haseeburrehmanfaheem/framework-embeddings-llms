To determine the access control level for the `getProfileIds` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `getProfileIds` method has two paths, but both of them involve the following key operations:

1. Retrieving user information using `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)`.
2. Accessing the size of `this.mUsers` and creating an `IntArray` based on it.
3. Converting the `IntArray` to an array and returning it.

The sink code provided highlights these key operations as well.

Now, let's compare this with the similar APIs:

- The `getProfiles(IZ)Ljava/util/List;` API has a similarity score of 0.9289003610610962 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also involves retrieving user information using `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` and returning a list related to the users. The high similarity score suggests that `getProfileIds` might require a similar access control level due to its interaction with user management services.

- The `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId(I)I` API has a lower similarity score of 0.8477106094360352 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Although this API also retrieves user information, it does not involve the same level of user data manipulation or return complex user-related data structures as `getProfileIds` does.

Considering these points:

- The `getProfileIds` method directly interacts with user management services (retrieving user info and manipulating user-related data), which suggests a need for a more restrictive access control.
- Its high similarity to the `getProfiles(IZ)Ljava/util/List;` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, supports the notion that it should have a similar or equally restrictive access control level.

Therefore, given the interaction with sensitive user information and its similarity to other APIs that require higher access control levels, the final access control level for the `getProfileIds` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision reflects the need for the `getProfileIds` method to be protected at a level that ensures only system or signature-authorized processes can access and manipulate user profile information.
