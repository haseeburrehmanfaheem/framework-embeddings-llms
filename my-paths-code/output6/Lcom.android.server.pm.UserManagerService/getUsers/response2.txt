To determine the access control level for the `getUsers` method, let's analyze its code and the provided similar APIs along with their access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis of `getUsers`:**
   - The method returns a list of users based on certain conditions (booleans `p1`, `p2`, `p3`) but does not directly interact with sensitive user data in a way that suggests a high risk of privacy or security breaches.
   - It checks the size of `this.mUsers` and iterates or manipulates this collection without exposing any sensitive operations like writing to external storage, accessing device location, making network calls, etc.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis:**
   - **`getCacheBytes(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)J`:** This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It interacts with user data indirectly by calling `getUsers()` on another object but does not perform any operations that would be considered security-sensitive.
   - **`getPrimaryUser()Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo;`:** Also has an access control level of `NONE`. This method retrieves information about the primary user, which could be considered less sensitive than other types of data but still involves handling user-related data.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that their operations do not pose significant security risks.
- The `getUsers` method's operations (returning a list of users based on certain conditions) seem to align more closely with data retrieval and manipulation rather than sensitive operations like modifying system settings, accessing fine-grained location, or making calls.

Considering the nature of the `getUsers` method and comparing it with the similar APIs provided:
- The method does not engage in dangerous operations such as those requiring permission (e.g., accessing external storage, camera, microphone).
- It primarily deals with retrieving user information without indicating a potential for significant security risk or privacy breach.

**Access Control Level Decision:**
Based on the analysis and comparisons made, assigning an access control level of `NONE` to the `getUsers` method seems appropriate. This is because it does not perform operations that would typically be classified as sensitive or dangerous from a security or privacy standpoint, similar to the provided comparable APIs.
