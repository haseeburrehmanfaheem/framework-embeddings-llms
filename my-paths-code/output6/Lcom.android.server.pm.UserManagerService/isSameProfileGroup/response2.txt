To assign an access control level to the `isSameProfileGroup` API, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The provided code snippets for `isSameProfileGroup` show that it accesses user information through `this.mUsers.get(p1)` and checks removing user IDs via `this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1)`, which are similar operations to those found in the provided similar APIs (`getProfileParent` and `canHaveRestrictedProfile`). These APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given that:
- The `isSameProfileGroup` method performs operations that are comparable to `getProfileParent` and `canHaveRestrictedProfile`, which both have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The sink code for `isSameProfileGroup` involves accessing user data and checking removing user IDs, similar to the operations in `getProfileParent` and `canHaveRestrictedProfile`.

Based on this analysis, since the operations and accessed data are not sensitive enough to warrant a higher access control level (like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`) and considering the similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, we can conclude that the appropriate access control level for the `isSameProfileGroup` API is also `NONE`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
