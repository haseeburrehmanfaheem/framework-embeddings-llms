To assign an access control level to the `getUserIconBadgeResId` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `getUserIconBadgeResId` method has two paths with depth 2, but they are identical. The method retrieves a `UserInfo` object using `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)`, checks if it's not null, and then retrieves a `UserTypeDetails` object from a map. If the `UserTypeDetails` object is not null and has a badge, it returns the icon badge resource ID.

The sink code includes three lines:
1. `UserInfo v4 = UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1);`
2. `boolean v6 = v2.hasBadge();`
3. `int v7 = v2.getIconBadge();`

Now, let's analyze the similar APIs:

* `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9399104118347168 and an access control level of NONE. Its code is very similar to `getUserIconBadgeResId`, with the only difference being that it returns the badge no background resource ID instead of the icon badge resource ID.
* `getUserBadgeResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9390504360198975 and an access control level of NONE. Its code is also very similar to `getUserIconBadgeResId`, with the only difference being that it returns the badge plain resource ID instead of the icon badge resource ID.

Given the similarities between these APIs, it's likely that they are all related to retrieving different types of badge resource IDs for a user. Since the similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, and the code snippets are very similar, it's reasonable to assign the same access control level to `getUserIconBadgeResId`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign the following access control level to the `getUserIconBadgeResId` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
