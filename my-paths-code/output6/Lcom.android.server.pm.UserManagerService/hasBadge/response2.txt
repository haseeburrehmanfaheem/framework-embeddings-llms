To assign an access control level to the `hasBadge` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `hasBadge` method interacts with the `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` and `this.mUserTypes.get(v3)` sinks, which are also present in the similar APIs (`isCredentialSharableWithParent` and `getUserBadgeResId`). 

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the interactions with the mentioned sinks do not require elevated permissions or pose significant risks.

Given the similarities in the code structure and the presence of the same sinks, it is reasonable to conclude that the `hasBadge` method does not require a higher access control level than `NONE`.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
