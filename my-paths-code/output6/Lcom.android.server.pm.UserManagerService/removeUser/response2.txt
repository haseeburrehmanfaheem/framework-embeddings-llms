To assign an access control level to the `removeUser` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeUser` method has three paths with depth 2, but they all have similar structures and interact with the same sinks:

1. `Object v10 = this.mUsers.get(p1);`
2. `boolean v11 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);`
3. `Bundle v24 = this.mCachedEffectiveUserRestrictions.getRestrictions(p1);`
4. `int v20 = UserHandle.getCallingUserId();`
5. `Bundle v25 = UserManagerService.computeEffectiveUserRestrictionsLR(p1);`
6. `boolean v26 = this.mCachedEffectiveUserRestrictions.updateRestrictions(p1, v25);`
7. `Bundle v28 = new Bundle();` (or `new Bundle(v23);`)
8. `boolean v30 = v21.getBoolean(v8, 0);`

The similar APIs provided are:

* `removeUserWhenPossible(IZ)I` with a similarity score of 0.9027903079986572 and access control level `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code interacts with similar sinks:
	+ `Object v4 = this.mUsers.get(p1);`
	+ `boolean v5 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);`
	+ `int v14 = UserHandle.getCallingUserId();`
	+ `Bundle v18 = this.mCachedEffectiveUserRestrictions.getRestrictions(p1);`
* `removeUserWhenPossible(IZ)I` with a similarity score of 0.8827438354492188 and access control level `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code interacts with a similar sink:
	+ `Bundle v22 = new Bundle(v17);`

Based on the similarities in code structure and sink interactions, it is likely that the `removeUser` method requires a similar access control level as the provided APIs.

Given the information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeUser` method, as it interacts with sensitive user data and restrictions, which are typically protected by system or signature-level permissions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
