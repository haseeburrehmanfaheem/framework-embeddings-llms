To determine the access control level for the `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Code Analysis**: The code snippet for `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` involves several conditional checks and interactions with various objects such as `UserInfo`, `UserTypeDetails`, and arrays like `mDarkThemeBadgeColors`. It returns an integer value related to a user's badge color in dark theme settings, specifically focusing on retrieving this information based on the user's profile badge.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code is focused on returning the badge color for a specific user profile badge (`UserInfo.profileBadge`) by calling `UserTypeDetails.getBadgeColor(UserInfo.profileBadge)`. This suggests that the method is involved in accessing and returning user-specific visual settings or data, which might not be sensitive in terms of privacy or security but could influence the app's behavior or appearance.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getUserBadgeColorResId(I)I` with an access control level of `NONE`: This API returns a badge color resource ID based on the user's profile badge, similar to our target method but focused on general (not specifically dark theme) badge colors.
   - `getUserBadgeLabelResId(I)I` with an access control level of `NONE`: This method returns a badge label resource ID, again based on the user's profile badge. It's similar in structure and purpose to the badge color methods.

Given these points:

- The method does not seem to handle sensitive data (like personal identifiable information, location data, etc.) that would typically require higher access control levels (`DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`).
- It interacts with user-specific settings but in a context (badge colors for dark themes) that is more related to the app's visual customization rather than security or privacy-sensitive operations.
- The similar APIs provided, which deal with closely related functionality (retrieving resource IDs for badges), are classified under `NONE` access control. This suggests that the operations involved in these methods are considered standard and not risky.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the method's purpose, its interactions, and the comparisons with similar APIs, it appears that the `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` method does not require elevated access controls. Therefore, the appropriate access control level for this API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
