To determine the access control level for the `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` involves retrieving user information and checking if a badge exists for a specific user type. It then returns the resource ID of the badge without the background. This operation does not seem to involve sensitive data or actions that could compromise the system's security or privacy.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code points involve getting user info, accessing user types, checking for badges, and retrieving badge resources. These operations are related to user interface elements and do not directly imply access to sensitive information or dangerous operations.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `getUserBadgeResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9855754375457764 and an access control level of NONE. This API is very similar in terms of functionality, as it also deals with retrieving badge resource IDs, differing only in the type of badge (plain instead of no background).
   - `getUserIconBadgeResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9399104118347168 and an access control level of NONE. This method is similar in that it retrieves icon badge resources, which is related to the functionality of dealing with badges but focuses on icons.

Given these analyses:
- The operations performed by `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` do not involve sensitive data or dangerous actions.
- The similar APIs (`getUserBadgeResId` and `getUserIconBadgeResId`) have an access control level of NONE, suggesting that operations related to retrieving badge resource IDs are considered safe and do not require elevated permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the similarity in functionality with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of NONE, and considering the nature of the operations involved (retrieving user badge resources without background), it is reasonable to assign the `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method an access control level of NONE.
