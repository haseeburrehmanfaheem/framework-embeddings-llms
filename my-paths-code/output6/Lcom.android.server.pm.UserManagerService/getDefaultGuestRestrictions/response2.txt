To determine the access control level for the `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` method returns a Bundle object that contains the default guest restrictions. It creates a copy of the `mGuestRestrictions` Bundle and returns this copy.

2. **Analyzing Similar APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs (`setUserRestriction`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that they are dealing with sensitive operations related to user restrictions, which require either system or signature-level permissions.
   - These methods involve merging and setting user restrictions, indicating they have the capability to modify or affect the security or privacy settings of a device.

3. **Comparing Semantics**:
   - The `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` method does not modify any settings but rather returns existing default guest restrictions. This is a read operation that does not alter the state of user restrictions.
   - Unlike the similar APIs provided, which involve setting or merging restrictions (write operations), `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` only retrieves information.

4. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Given that `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` is a read-only operation and does not modify any sensitive settings, it likely requires less stringent access control compared to the similar APIs that can alter user restriction settings.
   - The fact that it deals with guest restrictions (which are related to device security and privacy) might suggest some level of protection. However, since it's only reading default values and not modifying them or accessing highly sensitive information directly, the access control does not need to be as restrictive as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` seems to be `NORMAL`. This is because it involves accessing device settings but in a read-only manner that doesn't pose significant risks like modifying user restrictions would. The method's operation does not require system-level permissions or signature verification typically associated with more sensitive operations.
