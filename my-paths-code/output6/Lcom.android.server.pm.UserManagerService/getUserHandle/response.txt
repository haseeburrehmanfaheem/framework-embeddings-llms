Based on the provided code snippet, here's the analysis:

The given method `getUserHandle` does not contain any sinks that require access control according to the positive rules. 

However, for completeness and following the format you've requested, since there are no explicit instructions that collectively contribute to a sink as per the defined positive rules, the JSON output would reflect this absence:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that within the provided snippet of `getUserHandle`, no instructions were identified as contributing to potential sinks based on the criteria outlined.
