To determine the access control level for the `isUserRunning` API, we'll analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs (`isUserUnlocked` and `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked`) that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The provided code snippets (paths 1 and 2) for `isUserRunning` are essentially the same, indicating a consistent behavior across different paths within the method. The critical parts of the code involve checking if a user state exists (`this.states.indexOfKey(p1)`) and then retrieving that state (`this.states.get(p1)`), followed by a conditional return based on these states.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code points out key operations: finding an index of a key in `states` and getting the value associated with a key from `states`, which are both used to determine the return value (`boolean v2`). These operations do not inherently suggest dangerous or sensitive data access that would typically require higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **isUserUnlocked(I)Z**: Has an access control level of `NONE`. Its code snippet is very similar to the sink code of `isUserRunning`, focusing on state retrieval and conditional return without any indication of sensitive operations.
   - **isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(I)Z**: Also has an access control level of `NONE`. The provided code for this API shows a direct interaction with user states, similar to `isUserRunning`, but lacks the conditional structure around the state retrieval.

Given these observations:
- All APIs (`isUserRunning`, `isUserUnlocked`, and `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked`) deal with checking or retrieving user states without indications of performing sensitive operations that would necessitate higher access control levels.
- The similarity in code patterns and lack of sensitive data handling across these APIs suggest a consistent access control requirement.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons, the most appropriate access control level for the `isUserRunning` API is `NONE`, as it aligns with the behavior and requirements observed in similar APIs that also interact with user states without performing dangerous or system/signature-protected operations.
