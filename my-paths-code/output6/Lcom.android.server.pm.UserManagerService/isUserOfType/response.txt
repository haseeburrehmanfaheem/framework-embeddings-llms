The provided code paths for the API `isUserOfType` appear to be identical, and there are several issues with them:

1. The condition `if (p2 == 0)` will always throw a `NullPointerException` because `p2` is a `String`, and you cannot compare it directly to an integer using `==`. You probably meant to check if `p2` is null or empty.
2. The variable `v3` is initialized as `UserInfo v3 = 0;`, which will throw a compile-time error because you cannot assign an integer value to an object reference.
3. The line `String v2 = ;` is incomplete and will not compile.

Assuming the corrected code, let's analyze the potential sinks:

The API `isUserOfType` takes two parameters: `p1` (an integer) and `p2` (a string). It accesses several fields and methods, including:

* `this.mUsers.get(p1)`
* `this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1)`
* `UserInfo.partial`

Based on the positive rules, we can identify potential sinks as follows:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object v4 = this.mUsers.get(p1);",
      "boolean v5 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The `mUsers` and `mRemovingUserIds` fields are accessed using the input parameter `p1`, which meets one of the positive rules. However, there is no clear data flow link between these two instructions that would suggest they form a single sink.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that these two instructions are accessing different data structures (`mUsers` and `mRemovingUserIds`) based on the input parameter `p1`. Therefore, they can be considered as separate sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object v4 = this.mUsers.get(p1);"
    ],
    [
      "boolean v5 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

However, since the provided code paths are identical and have several issues, it's difficult to provide a more accurate analysis without additional context or corrected code. 

Considering the given information and assuming that `mUsers` is more sensitive than `mRemovingUserIds`, we can rank the sinks accordingly:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object v4 = this.mUsers.get(p1);"
    ],
    [
      "boolean v5 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Keep in mind that a more accurate analysis would require corrected and complete code.
