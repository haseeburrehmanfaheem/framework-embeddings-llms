To determine the access control level for the `isUserOfType` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Sink Code**: The sink codes provided are `'Object v4 = this.mUsers.get(p1);'` and `'boolean v5 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);'`. These lines indicate that the method is accessing user data and removing user IDs, which could be sensitive operations.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getUserIcon(I)Landroid/os/ParcelFileDescriptor;**: This API has a similarity score of 0.9878681302070618 with `isUserOfType` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippet for this API shows it accessing user data (`Object v3 = this.mUsers.get(p1);`), which suggests that such operations are considered sensitive or require system or signature-level permissions.
   - **getSeedAccountType(I)Ljava/lang/String;**: This API also has a high similarity score of 0.9878681302070618 but is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It accesses user data in a similar way (`Object v3 = this.mUsers.get(p1);`). The difference in access control levels between these two highly similar APIs might indicate that the nature of the data being accessed or the specific use case influences the access control decision.

Given the information:
- The method `isUserOfType` interacts with sensitive user data, as indicated by the sink codes.
- Highly similar APIs have different access control levels, suggesting that the specific context (e.g., what kind of user data is being accessed and how it's being used) plays a significant role in determining the access control level.

Considering these points:
- The `SYS_OR_SIG` level for `getUserIcon` implies that accessing certain types of user data may require system or signature-level permissions, possibly due to the sensitive nature of the data (e.g., icons that could be used to identify users).
- The `NONE` level for `getSeedAccountType` suggests that not all user data access requires elevated permissions, potentially because the data accessed is less sensitive or because the API's purpose does not pose a significant risk.

Given the `isUserOfType` method's interaction with what appears to be sensitive user data (checking if a user is of a certain type and accessing removing user IDs), and considering the precedent set by similar APIs, especially the one requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions, it seems reasonable to conclude that this method should also require careful access control. However, without explicit indications of the data's sensitivity or the method's potential impact on system security or privacy, assigning it the same level as `getUserIcon` might be cautious but not necessarily required based solely on the provided information.

Given the choices and considering the context provided:
- **NONE** seems too permissive given the potential sensitivity of user data.
- **NORMAL** could be appropriate if the method's access to user data is deemed not to pose a significant risk, but this doesn't align with the cautious approach suggested by similar APIs.
- **DANGEROUS** might be an overestimation unless there are specific risks associated with determining a user's type that aren't immediately apparent from the provided code snippets.
- **SYS_OR_SIG** suggests a need for system or signature-level permissions, which could be appropriate if accessing or modifying user types requires such elevated access, aligning with the precedent set by `getUserIcon`.

Considering these points and aiming for a cautious approach while acknowledging the method's potential interaction with sensitive data, but without clear indications of its specific risks:

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
