To determine the access control level for the `getUserRestrictionSources` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The method interacts with sensitive data such as user restrictions and device policy local restrictions.

Here are the key points from the `getUserRestrictionSources` method:

1. It checks if the provided restriction (`p1`) is contained within the `USER_RESTRICTIONS`.
2. It retrieves the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and gets the packages for this UID.
3. Based on certain conditions, it creates a new `UserManager$EnforcingUser` or retrieves enforcing users from device policy local restrictions and global user restrictions.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `hasUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs deal with user restrictions and have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access the sensitive data.

Given the similarities in functionality and the interaction with sensitive user restriction data, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getUserRestrictionSources` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized system components or applications signed with the platform key can access this sensitive information.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getUserRestrictionSources` API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
