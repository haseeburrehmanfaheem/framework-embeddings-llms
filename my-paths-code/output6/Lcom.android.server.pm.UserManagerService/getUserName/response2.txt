To determine the access control level for the `getUserName` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The code snippets for the `getUserName` method show interactions with user data, specifically retrieving a user ID using `UserHandle.getUserId(v1)` and accessing user information through `this.mUsers.get(v4)`. These operations are related to managing or accessing user-specific data.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code provided includes lines that interact with user IDs and user information objects, such as `int v4 = UserHandle.getUserId(v1);`, `Object v6 = this.mUsers.get(v4);`, and `UserInfo v19 = new UserInfo(v5);`. These are indicative of operations that handle sensitive user data.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - The API `isUserOfType(ILjava/lang/String;)Z` has a similarity score of 0.8370752334594727 and an access control level of NONE. Its code interacts with user data using `Object v4 = this.mUsers.get(p1);`, which is similar to the operations in `getUserName`.
   - The API `getUserInfo(I)Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo;` has a similarity score of 0.8300814628601074 and an access control level of NONE. It accesses user information with `Object v3 = this.mUsers.get(p1);`, which is also similar to the operations in `getUserName`.

Given these points, we can observe that both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, despite interacting with sensitive user data. This could suggest that the specific interactions (e.g., retrieving user IDs or accessing user info objects) within the context of these methods do not require higher access controls like NORMAL, DANGEROUS, or SYS_OR_SIG.

However, it's crucial to consider the context and the specific Android version or framework being referenced, as access control levels can vary based on how sensitive the data is considered in different versions or contexts. The provided information does not explicitly indicate that `getUserName` handles data that would necessitate a higher level of protection than NONE.

**Conclusion**: Based on the similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of NONE and considering the operations involved, it seems reasonable to conclude that `getUserName` should also have an access control level of NONE, assuming there are no additional context-specific factors requiring elevated protections.
