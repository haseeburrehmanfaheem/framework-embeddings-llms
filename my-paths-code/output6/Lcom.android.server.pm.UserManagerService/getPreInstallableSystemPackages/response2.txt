To determine the access control level for the `getPreInstallableSystemPackages` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getPreInstallableSystemPackages` method appears to be related to managing system packages and user types. It interacts with various system properties, package managers, and user type masks. The sink code suggests that it accesses sensitive information, such as device default whitelist modes, user types, and package lists.

Comparing this method with the similar APIs:

1. `canAddMoreProfilesToUser`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7511467337608337 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It also interacts with user types, package managers, and system features.
2. `getUserRestrictionSources`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7501243352890015 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It deals with user restrictions, package managers, and device policy local restrictions.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive information.

Considering the similarities in code and functionality, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `getPreInstallableSystemPackages` method.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's interactions with sensitive system information, user types, and package managers, which are similar to the characteristics of the provided similar APIs with SYS_OR_SIG access control levels.
