To determine the access control level for the `getUserInfo` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs.

The `getUserInfo` method appears to retrieve user information based on a provided ID (`p1`). If the user is not found, it checks if the user is being removed and attempts to create a new `UserInfo` object. The method interacts with sensitive data, such as user IDs and names.

Comparing this with similar APIs:

* `getProfileParent(I)Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo;` has an access control level of `NONE`. This API also retrieves user information, but its code snippet shows a simpler interaction with the `mUsers` and `mRemovingUserIds` objects.
* `isSameProfileGroup(II)Z` also has an access control level of `NONE`. This API checks if two users belong to the same profile group, and its code snippet is similar to `getProfileParent`.

Given these similarities, it seems that the `getUserInfo` method does not require elevated permissions or special handling. The interactions with sensitive data are comparable to those in the similar APIs, which have an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons, I would assign the following access control level to the `getUserInfo` API:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is informed by the similarity in behavior and code structure between `getUserInfo` and the compared APIs, as well as the nature of the interactions with sensitive data.
