Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `isUserNameSet` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `isUserNameSet` method has two paths with depth 1, both of which interact with the same sinks: `this.mUsers.get(p1)` and `this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1)`. These sinks are also present in the similar APIs `getProfileParent` and `isSameProfileGroup`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`.

The similarity score between `isUserNameSet` and these APIs is 0.9911967515945435, indicating a high degree of similarity. The code snippets for these APIs also show that they interact with the same sinks in a similar manner.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `isUserNameSet` method should have the same access control level as its similar APIs, which is `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
