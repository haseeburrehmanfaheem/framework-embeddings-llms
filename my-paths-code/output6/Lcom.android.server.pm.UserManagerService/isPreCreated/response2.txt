To determine the access control level for the `isPreCreated` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `isPreCreated(int p1)` checks if a user with the given ID (`p1`) is pre-created.
   - It interacts with two main data structures: `this.mUsers` and `this.mRemovingUserIds`.
   - The logic involves checking for the existence of a user and their removal status, but there's no direct interaction with sensitive resources (like external storage, network, or hardware) that typically require higher access control levels.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`canHaveRestrictedProfile(I)Z` and `getProfileParent(I)Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo;`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - These APIs also interact with the same data structures (`this.mUsers` and `this.mRemovingUserIds`) in a manner similar to `isPreCreated`, focusing on user information retrieval without accessing sensitive resources or performing actions that would typically require elevated permissions.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not access sensitive data or perform operations requiring specific permissions.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that may interact with some level of user data but do not pose a significant risk.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can potentially cause harm, leak sensitive information, or affect the system significantly require this level.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for operations requiring system or signature-level permissions, usually impacting system functionality directly.

Given the analysis:
- The method does not interact with external resources or perform actions that would typically be classified as dangerous.
- It retrieves user information based on IDs and checks removal status, which is similar to the behavior of the provided APIs with `NONE` access control level.

**Conclusion**: Based on the code snippet and the similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, the `isPreCreated` method should also be classified as requiring no specific permission to execute its functionality, as it does not pose a risk or interact with sensitive data in a manner that would necessitate higher access control.
