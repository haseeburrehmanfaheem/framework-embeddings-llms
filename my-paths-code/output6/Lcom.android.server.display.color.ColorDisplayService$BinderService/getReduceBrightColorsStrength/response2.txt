To determine the access control level for the `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` method is defined as follows:
```java
public int getReduceBrightColorsStrength(){
    long v1 = Binder.clearCallingIdentity();
    ReduceBrightColorsTintController v2 = this.mReduceBrightColorsTintController;
    int v3 = this.mStrength;
    Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1);
    return v3;
}
```
The method returns the value of `this.mStrength`, which is an integer representing the strength of reducing bright colors.

The sink code for this method is:
```java
['int v3 = this.mStrength;\nreturn v3;']
```
This suggests that the method is simply returning a stored value without performing any sensitive operations.

Now, let's compare this method with the similar APIs:

1. `getNightDisplayColorTemperature()`: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and returns an integer value based on `this.mColorTemp`. The similarity score with `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` is 0.7465596199035645.
2. `getRefreshRateSwitchingType()`: This method also has an access control level of `NONE` and returns an integer value based on `this.mModeSwitchingType`. The similarity score with `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` is 0.7040700912475586.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not perform any sensitive operations or access sensitive data. The code snippets for these methods also suggest that they simply return stored values without performing any complex operations.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` method is similar to the other two APIs in terms of its functionality and does not perform any sensitive operations. Therefore, it is likely that the access control level for this method should also be `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
