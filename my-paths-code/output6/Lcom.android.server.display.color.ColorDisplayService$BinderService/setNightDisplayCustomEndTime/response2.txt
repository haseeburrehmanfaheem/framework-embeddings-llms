To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method interacts with system settings by writing to `"night_display_custom_end_time"` using `Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`. This suggests that it modifies system-level settings.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves getting a local time from the input parameter and then converting this time into seconds of the day, which is used to update a secure setting. This operation implies modification of system settings.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setNightDisplayCustomStartTime**: This API has a high similarity score (0.935695230960846) with `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows that it also modifies system settings by writing to `"night_display_custom_start_time"`.
   - **getNightDisplayCustomEndTime**: Although this API has a lower similarity score (0.8864814639091492) compared to `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime`, its access control level is `NONE`. This method reads from the system setting instead of modifying it, which explains the less restrictive access control.

Given these points:
- The method modifies system settings by writing to a secure setting, which typically requires higher access control.
- A very similar method (`setNightDisplayCustomStartTime`) with the same kind of operation (modifying system settings) is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that such modifications are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the code analysis, interaction with system settings, and comparison with similar APIs, especially `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` which has a high similarity score and modifies system settings in a similar way, the `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects its potential to modify sensitive system settings, requiring appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized changes.
