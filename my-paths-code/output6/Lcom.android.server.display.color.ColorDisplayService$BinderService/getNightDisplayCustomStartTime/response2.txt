To determine the access control level for the `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method, we should consider its functionality and how it interacts with system settings, as well as compare it to similar APIs provided.

1. **Functionality**: This method retrieves a custom start time for night display from secure settings. The retrieval of settings does not inherently pose a risk or require special permissions unless the data being retrieved is sensitive or could be used in a malicious manner.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime()`: This has an access control level of `NONE`. It performs a similar operation by retrieving the end time for night display, which suggests that reading these specific settings does not require elevated permissions.
   - `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime(Time)`: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission. This is because setting custom start times could potentially be used to manipulate device behavior in undesired ways, thus requiring higher access control.

3. **Analysis**: 
   - The `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method only reads a setting and does not modify any system settings. Reading system settings typically requires less stringent permissions compared to writing them.
   - Given that the similar API for getting the end time (`getNightDisplayCustomEndTime`) has an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that reading these types of settings is not considered dangerous or sensitive.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on its functionality and comparison with similar APIs, especially considering that a similar get method (`getNightDisplayCustomEndTime`) has an access control level of `NONE`, the `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method should also be classified as having an access control level of `NONE`. This is because it does not pose any risk by merely retrieving information without modifying system settings.
