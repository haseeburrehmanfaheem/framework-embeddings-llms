To determine the access control level for the `setReduceBrightColorsStrength` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `setReduceBrightColorsStrength` method writes an integer value to the secure settings with the key "reduce_bright_colors_level" for a specific user. This operation is related to display settings, which can be considered as a system-level configuration.

Looking at the similar APIs:

1. `setReduceBrightColorsActivated(Z)Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and its code snippet also writes to secure settings with a key related to display settings.
2. `setColorMode(I)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and its code snippet writes to system settings with a key related to display settings.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to execute. The `setReduceBrightColorsStrength` method performs a similar operation, writing to secure settings, which suggests that it should also require a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `setReduceBrightColorsStrength` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
