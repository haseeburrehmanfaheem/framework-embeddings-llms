To determine the access control level for the `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` retrieves a setting value from `Settings$Secure` related to the night display auto mode for a specific user.
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)` to manage the calling identity, which is a common pattern in Android services to handle IPC (Inter-Process Communication) securely.
   - The critical part of the code interacts with `Settings$Secure.getIntForUser`, which accesses user-specific secure settings.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **`setNightDisplayAutoMode(I)Z`**: This API has a similarity score of 0.8902426958084106 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It sets the night display auto mode and also interacts with user-specific secure settings (`Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`). The high similarity suggests that both methods deal with sensitive settings, but setting a value might require higher privileges compared to just reading it.
   - **`getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()`**: This API has a lower similarity score of 0.820824146270752 and an access control level of `NONE`. It reads another night display-related setting (`night_display_custom_start_time`) from user-specific secure settings. Despite the lower similarity, both this method and `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` read sensitive user settings without altering them.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` reads a user-specific setting (`night_display_auto_mode`) without modifying it, its operation is similar to `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()`, which has an access control level of `NONE`. 
   - Reading settings typically requires less privilege than writing them. Since `setNightDisplayAutoMode(I)Z` has a higher access control level due to its ability to modify settings, and considering the nature of `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` is to only read a setting, it aligns more closely with operations that do not require significant privileges.
   - Therefore, based on the provided APIs and their access control levels, `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` should have an access control level that reflects its read-only operation on user-specific settings.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's functionality is to retrieve a setting without modifying it, similar to other APIs with lower access control requirements for reading operations, the most appropriate access control level for `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` would be `NORMAL`. This choice balances the need for controlled access to user settings while recognizing that read operations generally pose less risk than write operations.
