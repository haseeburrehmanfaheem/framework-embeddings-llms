To determine the access control level for the `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method, let's analyze the provided information.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method retrieves a custom end time for night display from secure settings (`Settings$Secure.getIntForUser`) and converts it into a `Time` object.
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity`, which suggests that the method is cautious about handling caller identities, typically to prevent leaks or ensure the operation is performed with the correct identity.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()**: This method has a high similarity score (0.9398541450500488) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It performs a similar operation, retrieving a custom start time from secure settings. The similarity in functionality and the lack of sensitive operations suggest that accessing this information might not be considered harmful or dangerous.
   - **setNightDisplayCustomEndTime(Time)**: With a similarity score of 0.8864814639091492, this method is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It sets the custom end time for night display in secure settings. The higher access control level here can be justified because setting values, especially in secure settings, often requires more permissions or controls than merely reading them.

3. **Access Control Level Decision**:
   - Given that `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method reads from secure settings but does not modify them, and considering the similarity with `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` which has an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that reading this specific setting is not considered sensitive or dangerous.
   - The method's operation (reading a value) aligns more closely with `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` than with `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`, in terms of potential impact and required permissions.

Based on the analysis, since the method reads from secure settings without modifying them, and given its similarity to other methods with lower access control levels for reading operations, the most appropriate access control level for `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` would be `NONE`.
