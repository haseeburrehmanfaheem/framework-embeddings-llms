Here's the analysis of the provided API code:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "boolean v8 = Settings$Secure.putIntForUser(v7, \"display_white_balance_enabled\", p1, this.mCurrentUser);",
            "return v4;"
        ]
    ]
}
```
Explanation:
- `Settings$Secure.putIntForUser` method has a naming similarity with the concept of setting a display property and it processes the input parameter `p1`. 
- The return value of `Settings$Secure.putIntForUser` is assigned to `v8`, then propagated through `v5` and `v4`, and finally returned by the API.
- Other instructions in the code, such as obtaining context objects or restoring calling identity, are considered auxiliary operations according to the negative rules. 

Note: I corrected `p2` to `p1` in the `putIntForUser` method call, assuming it was a typo since there's no `p2` parameter declared in the method signature.
