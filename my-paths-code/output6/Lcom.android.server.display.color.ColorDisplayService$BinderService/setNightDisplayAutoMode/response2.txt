To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayAutoMode` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method modifies secure settings (`Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`) which typically requires careful consideration of access controls to prevent unauthorized changes.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw()` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method reads a setting and does not modify it, which aligns with why it might have a lower access control requirement.
   - `getNightDisplayAutoMode()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it's either restricted to system or signature applications, or requires a specific signature to call. This suggests that reading the night display auto mode is considered sensitive.

3. **Sinks and Access Control**:
   - The sink code shows modification of secure settings (`"night_display_auto_mode"`), which usually necessitates higher access control levels due to the potential impact on device behavior and security.
   - The method also interacts with `ColorDisplayService.getNightDisplayAutoModeInternal()`, suggesting it deals with internal, potentially sensitive operations related to display settings.

Given these considerations:

- Modifying secure settings typically requires at least a `NORMAL` access control level to ensure that only authorized applications can make such changes. However, given the specific nature of this setting and its potential impact on system behavior, a higher level might be warranted.
- The similarity with `getNightDisplayAutoMode()` which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that operations related to night display auto mode are considered sensitive.
- Since `setNightDisplayAutoMode` modifies settings rather than just reading them (like `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw()`), it likely requires stricter access controls.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `setNightDisplayAutoMode` seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it involves modifying system settings that could potentially impact the device's functionality and security. This aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs that interact with sensitive system settings.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This choice reflects the method's potential to affect system behavior significantly and the need to restrict its access to system or signature applications, ensuring that modifications to night display auto mode settings are authorized and secure.
