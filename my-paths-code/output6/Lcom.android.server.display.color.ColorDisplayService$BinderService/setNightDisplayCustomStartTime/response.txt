Here's the JSON output for the provided code:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "long v3 = Binder.clearCallingIdentity();",
            "Context v6 = ColorDisplayService.getContext();",
            "ContentResolver v7 = v6.getContentResolver();",
            "LocalTime v8 = p1.getLocalTime();",  
            "int v9 = v8.toSecondOfDay();",
            "boolean v10 = Settings$Secure.putIntForUser(v7, \"night_display_custom_start_time\", (v9 * 1000), this.mCurrentUser);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` call and the subsequent `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` are auxiliary operations for managing calling identities.
- However, in the provided JSON output, I excluded these calls because they don't directly contribute to a sink according to the given rules. Instead, they're related to context management.
- The main data flow starts with getting the local time from `p1` and converting it into seconds of the day (`v9 = v8.toSecondOfDay();`).
- Then, this value is used to set an integer for a specific user in secure settings (`boolean v10 = Settings$Secure.putIntForUser(v7, "night_display_custom_start_time", (v9 * 1000), this.mCurrentUser);`), which meets the criteria of having input parameters as arguments.
- The `LocalTime v8 = p1.getLocalTime();` line is added to show data flow from the API parameter `p1`.
- Note that I corrected `p2` in your example code to `p1`, assuming it was a typo since there's only one parameter declared in the method signature. 

Here's an updated and more accurate JSON output considering the given rules:
```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "LocalTime v8 = p1.getLocalTime();",
            "int v9 = v8.toSecondOfDay();",
            "boolean v10 = Settings$Secure.putIntForUser(v7, \"night_display_custom_start_time\", (v9 * 1000), this.mCurrentUser);"
        ]
    ]
}
```
