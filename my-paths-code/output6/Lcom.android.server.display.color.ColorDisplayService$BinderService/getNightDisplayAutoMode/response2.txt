To assign an access control level to the `getNightDisplayAutoMode` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getNightDisplayAutoMode` method retrieves the night display auto mode from the `ColorDisplayService` class. It calls `getNightDisplayAutoModeRawInternal()` to get the raw internal value and then performs some conditional checks before returning a value.

Comparing this method with the similar APIs:

1. `setNightDisplayAutoMode(I)Z`: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission to modify the night display auto mode setting. Although the `getNightDisplayAutoMode` method only retrieves a value and does not modify any settings, its similarity score with this method is relatively high (0.8244326710700989). However, since it's a getter method, it might not require the same level of access control as the setter method.

2. `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw()I`: This method has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any special permissions to retrieve the raw night display auto mode value. The similarity score between this method and `getNightDisplayAutoMode` is 0.7819980978965759, which suggests that they share some similarities in their functionality.

Given these comparisons and considering the semantics of the `getNightDisplayAutoMode` method, it appears to be a getter method that retrieves a value without modifying any settings or accessing sensitive data. Therefore, it's reasonable to assign an access control level of `NONE` to this method, as it does not require any special permissions to execute.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
