Based on the provided information, I will analyze the given API and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `createBiInteractiveApp` method has a similarity score of over 0.97 with two other APIs: `resetInteractiveApp` and `notifyContentBlocked`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Upon reviewing the code snippets, I notice that all three APIs:

1. Call `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`
2. Get or create a user state using `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`
3. Get a session state using `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked`
4. Interact with an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object

The similarities in the code structure and the high similarity scores suggest that the `createBiInteractiveApp` method is likely to require a similar access control level as the other two APIs.

Given the semantics of the APIs, which seem to be related to managing interactive TV apps, it's reasonable to assume that they require a certain level of system or signature protection to prevent unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude that the `createBiInteractiveApp` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
