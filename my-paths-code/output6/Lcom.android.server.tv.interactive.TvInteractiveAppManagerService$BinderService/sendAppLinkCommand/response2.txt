Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `sendAppLinkCommand` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `sendAppLinkCommand` method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$UserState v10 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2);`
2. `Map v14 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetmIAppMap(v8);`
3. `Object v15 = v14.get(p1);`
4. `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$ServiceState v20 = new TvInteractiveAppManagerService$ServiceState(this.this$0,v17,p1,v3,0);`
5. `boolean v24 = this.mPendingAppLinkCommand.add(p2);`
6. `Intent v41 = new Intent("android.media.tv.interactive.TvInteractiveAppService");`
7. `Intent v43 = v41.setComponent(p2);`
8. `UserHandle v45 = new UserHandle(p3);`
9. `boolean v47 = this.mContext.bindServiceAsUser(v43, v44, 33554433, v45);`

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList(I)Ljava/util/List;` with a similarity score of 0.8780864477157593 and an access control level of NONE.
2. `registerAppLinkInfo(Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/media/tv/interactive/AppLinkInfo;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.8757849335670471 and an access control level of NONE.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, which suggests that they do not pose a significant security risk. However, the `sendAppLinkCommand` method appears to interact with more sensitive sinks, such as binding to a service using `bindServiceAsUser`.

After analyzing the code and considering the similarity scores, I believe that the `sendAppLinkCommand` method should have an access control level of NORMAL. This is because the method interacts with some sensitive sinks, but its overall behavior is similar to the other APIs in the system, which have an access control level of NONE.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

Note that this determination is based on the provided information and may not reflect the actual security requirements of the system. A more thorough analysis of the system's security policies and threat model would be necessary to make a definitive determination.
