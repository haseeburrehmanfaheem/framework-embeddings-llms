To determine the access control level for the `notifyAdResponse` method, we should consider the similarity in code and functionality with the provided similar APIs, `notifyContentBlocked` and `notifyError`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The key aspects to focus on include:

1. **Similarity in Code Structure**: All three methods (`notifyAdResponse`, `notifyContentBlocked`, and `notifyError`) share a similar structure in their code snippets. They all involve:
   - Handling the incoming user via `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`.
   - Getting or creating a user state locked by `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`.
   - Obtaining a session state locked by `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked`.
   - Interacting with an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object to notify it of specific events (ad response, content blocked, or error).

2. **Similarity in Functionality**: The functionality of these methods seems closely related, as they all appear to be part of a mechanism for managing interactive TV app sessions, handling different types of notifications or callbacks from these sessions.

3. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both `notifyContentBlocked` and `notifyError` have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the operations performed by these methods are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permission to execute, likely due to their involvement in managing TV interactive app sessions and the potential impact on user experience and data.

Given these observations:

- The code structure and functionality of `notifyAdResponse` closely align with those of `notifyContentBlocked` and `notifyError`.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they handle sensitive operations that require elevated permissions.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the `notifyAdResponse` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it likely involves similarly sensitive operations related to TV interactive app session management.

**Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's similarity in code and functionality with other methods that have been classified with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that it likely requires system or signature-level permissions to protect sensitive operations related to TV interactive app sessions.
