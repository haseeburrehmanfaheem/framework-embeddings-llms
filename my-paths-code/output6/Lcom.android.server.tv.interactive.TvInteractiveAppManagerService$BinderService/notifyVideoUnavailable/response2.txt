To determine the access control level for the `notifyVideoUnavailable` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `notifyVideoUnavailable` method has a similarity score of 1.0 with two other APIs: `notifyVideoAvailable` and `notifyContentAllowed`. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Looking at the code snippets, we can see that all three methods (`notifyVideoUnavailable`, `notifyVideoAvailable`, and `notifyContentAllowed`) interact with the same sinks:

1. `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`
2. `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`
3. `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked`

These sinks are related to user management and session state handling, which suggests that the methods are performing operations that require system or signature-level permissions.

Given the high similarity score (1.0) with the other two APIs and the identical interaction with the same sinks, it is reasonable to conclude that the `notifyVideoUnavailable` method should have the same access control level as the similar APIs.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the final access control level for the `notifyVideoUnavailable` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
