Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`: This sink is related to user management and requires careful consideration of access control.
2. `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getUserStateLocked`: This sink is specific to the TV interactive app manager service and may require access control to prevent unauthorized access.
3. `Map v19 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetmIAppMap(v13)`: This sink accesses a map of app states, which may contain sensitive information.
4. `boolean v57 = this.mContext.bindServiceAsUser(v50, v51, 33554433, v55)`: This sink binds a service as a specific user, which requires access control to prevent unauthorized binding.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `createSession(Landroid/media/tv/interactive/ITvInteractiveAppClient;Ljava/lang/String;III)V` with an access control level of `NONE`.
2. `registerAppLinkInfo(Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/media/tv/interactive/AppLinkInfo;I)V` with an access control level of `NONE`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require strict access control. However, the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method interacts with sinks related to user management and app state access, which may require some level of access control.

Considering the similarities between the APIs and the sinks they interact with, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method. This level indicates that the method requires some access control, but it is not as sensitive as methods that require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
