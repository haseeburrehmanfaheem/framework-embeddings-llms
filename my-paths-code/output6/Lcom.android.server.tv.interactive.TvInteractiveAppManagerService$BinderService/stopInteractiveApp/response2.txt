To determine the access control level for the `stopInteractiveApp` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `stopInteractiveApp` method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$UserState v10 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked(p4);`
2. `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState v11 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked(p2, p3, v10);`
3. `ITvInteractiveAppSession v14 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fgetmSession(p2);`
4. `v12.stopInteractiveApp();`

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `setTeletextAppEnabled(Landroid/os/IBinder;ZI)V` with a similarity score of 0.9239637851715088 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `destroyBiInteractiveApp(Landroid/os/IBinder;Ljava/lang/String;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.913094162940979 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access the interactive app sessions.

The `stopInteractiveApp` method has a similar code structure and interacts with the same sinks as the provided similar APIs. It also requires accessing and modifying the state of interactive app sessions, which is a sensitive operation.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the `stopInteractiveApp` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, similar to the provided similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
