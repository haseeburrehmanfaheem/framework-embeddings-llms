To determine the access control level for the `sendTrackInfoList` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `notifyTrackSelected`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `notifyTracksChanged`: SYS_OR_SIG

   Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to be invoked.

2. **Code Semantics and Sinks:**
   - The `sendTrackInfoList` method interacts with session states and ITVInteractiveAppSession objects, which are also found in the similar APIs.
   - It uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, suggesting some level of security or permission checking.
   - The sink code indicates that it accesses and potentially modifies session state and ITVInteractiveAppSession objects.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - The method's logic, including getting the calling UID, handling incoming users, and interacting with session states and ITVInteractiveAppSession objects, is consistent with the behavior of the similar APIs.
   - All these methods seem to operate within a context that requires careful access control due to their potential impact on system or application states.

Given this analysis:

- The method does not appear to perform operations that would categorize it as `NONE` (no specific permission required) since it deals with potentially sensitive session management and ITVInteractiveAppSession interactions.
- It's not explicitly performing operations that are typically classified as `DANGEROUS` in the Android permission model, such as directly accessing location, contacts, or other sensitive user data without a clear system or signature-level protection mechanism.
- The method does not fit neatly into the `NORMAL` category since its functionality is more specialized and seems to require a level of system integration or security that's beyond typical "normal" access control.

Therefore, considering the similar APIs have SYS_OR_SIG access control levels, and given the nature of the operations performed by `sendTrackInfoList`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also requires system or signature-level permissions to ensure proper access control and security.
