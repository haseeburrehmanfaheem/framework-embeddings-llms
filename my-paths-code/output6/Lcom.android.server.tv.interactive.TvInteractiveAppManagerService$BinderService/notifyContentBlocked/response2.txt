To determine the access control level for the `notifyContentBlocked` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method interacts with sensitive components such as `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`, and `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked`. These interactions suggest that the method deals with user-specific data and session management, which are security-sensitive operations.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `notifyAdResponse` API has a high similarity score (0.9812866449356079) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with user state and session state, similar to `notifyContentBlocked`.
   - The `notifySignalStrength` API shares a similar code structure and has a high similarity score (0.9812561869621277), with the same access control level assignment as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs (`notifyAdResponse` and `notifySignalStrength`) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to execute due to their interaction with sensitive user and session data.
- The `notifyContentBlocked` method follows a similar pattern in terms of code structure and interacts with the same type of sensitive data (user states and sessions).

**Conclusion**: Based on the similarity in code structure, functionality, and the access control levels of the provided similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `notifyContentBlocked` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This assignment reflects its need for system or signature-level permissions due to its sensitive operations.
