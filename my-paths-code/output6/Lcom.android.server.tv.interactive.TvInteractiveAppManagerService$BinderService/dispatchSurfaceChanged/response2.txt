To assign an access control level to the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs. 

The `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method has a similarity score of 0.9290087223052979 with the `requestAd` API and 0.9204305410385132 with the `tune` API, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method may also require a similar level of access control.

Looking at the code snippet of `dispatchSurfaceChanged`, we can see that it:

1. Calls `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` to handle incoming user requests, which is similar to the `requestAd` and `tune` APIs.
2. Gets or creates a user state using `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`, which is similar to the `requestAd` API.
3. Gets a session state using `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked`, which is similar to both the `requestAd` and `tune` APIs.

The sink code of `dispatchSurfaceChanged` also interacts with the same sinks as the similar APIs, such as getting or creating user states and session states.

Given these similarities, it's reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method, as it appears to require a similar level of system or signature-level access to perform its operations.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
