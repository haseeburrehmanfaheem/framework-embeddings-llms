Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `notifyTracksChanged` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `notifyTracksChanged` method interacts with the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService` and `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interfaces, which are also present in the similar APIs. The method's code snippet shows that it retrieves the session state, gets the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` instance, and calls the `notifyTracksChanged` method on it if the instance is not null.

The similar APIs, `notifyTrackSelected` and `sendCurrentChannelUri`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. They also interact with the same interfaces and follow a similar pattern of retrieving the session state and calling a method on the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` instance.

Given the similarity in code structure and interaction with the same interfaces, it is reasonable to conclude that the `notifyTracksChanged` method should have the same access control level as the similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `notifyTracksChanged` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
