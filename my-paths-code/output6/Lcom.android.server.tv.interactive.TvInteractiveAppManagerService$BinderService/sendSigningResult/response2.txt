To determine the access control level for the `sendSigningResult` method, let's analyze its code and the provided similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `sendSigningResult` method interacts with sensitive components such as `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, which suggests it deals with user and session management.
   - It also accesses `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$UserState` and `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState`, indicating that it handles states related to TV interactive app sessions.
   - The method calls `ITvInteractiveAppSession.sendSigningResult`, suggesting a direct interaction with an ITV interactive app session, which may involve security-sensitive operations like signing results.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`notifyVideoAvailable` and `notifyContentAllowed`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These APIs also interact with `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$UserState`, and `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState`, showing similarities in handling user and session states.
   - The high similarity score (0.9889209270477295) indicates that these methods share a lot of structural and possibly functional similarities with the `sendSigningResult` method.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given the similarities in code structure, interaction with sensitive components, and the high similarity scores with APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that the `sendSigningResult` method should also have a similar access control level.
   - The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically implies that the API can be accessed by system or signature applications, reflecting the need for elevated privileges to manage TV interactive app sessions and handle signing results securely.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis of the code snippet, the interaction with sensitive components, and the high similarity with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is appropriate to assign the same access control level to the `sendSigningResult` method.
