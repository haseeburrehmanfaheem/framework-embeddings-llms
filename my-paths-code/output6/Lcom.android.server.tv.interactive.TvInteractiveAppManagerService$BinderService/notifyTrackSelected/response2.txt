To determine the access control level of the `notifyTrackSelected` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The method interacts with `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState` and `ITvInteractiveAppSession`, which are part of the TV interactive app management system. It checks if a session exists and then notifies the track selection to that session if it does. This operation involves communication between different components of the system, specifically targeting sessions related to TV interactive apps.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `notifyTracksChanged`: This method also interacts with `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState` and `ITvInteractiveAppSession`. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permissions to execute, which is typical for operations that affect or interact with system services or sensitive data.
   - `sendTrackInfoList`: Similar to the above, this method also deals with sessions and track information within the TV interactive app context. It too has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, reinforcing the notion that such interactions require elevated permissions due to their nature of affecting system-level components or sensitive operations.

3. **Comparison**: The `notifyTrackSelected` method follows a similar pattern in terms of interacting with system services and session states related to TV interactive apps. Given its functionality is closely aligned with `notifyTracksChanged` and `sendTrackInfoList`, which both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that `notifyTrackSelected` should also require a similar level of access control.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the code analysis and comparison with similar APIs, the `notifyTrackSelected` method should be assigned an access control level that reflects its need for system or signature-level permissions due to its interaction with sensitive system components and operations.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
