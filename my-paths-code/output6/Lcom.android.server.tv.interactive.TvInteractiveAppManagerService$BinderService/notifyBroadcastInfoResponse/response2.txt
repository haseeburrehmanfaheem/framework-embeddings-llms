To determine the access control level for the `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method, let's analyze the information provided.

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**: 
   - Both similar APIs (`notifyVideoAvailable` and `notifyContentAllowed`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that these methods are considered to be system or signature protected, meaning they can only be called by processes that have the necessary permissions or are part of the system.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The code snippet for `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` involves checking the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`, which suggests some level of security or access control.
   - It also interacts with `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, which is a method that handles user management and could imply interactions across different users, potentially requiring system-level permissions.
   - The method further involves obtaining a lock (`TvInteractiveAppManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock`) and getting or creating user state locked (`TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`), which are operations that typically require careful access control to prevent data corruption or unauthorized access.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves handling incoming users, getting or creating user states, and notifying sessions, all of which suggest interactions that should be protected against unauthorized access.

Given these observations:

- The method's similarity with `notifyVideoAvailable` and `notifyContentAllowed`, both of which are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The involvement of system-level operations such as handling incoming users, managing sessions, and the use of locks.
- The potential for impacting user data or system integrity if not properly secured.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with its similar APIs and considering the nature of its operations.
