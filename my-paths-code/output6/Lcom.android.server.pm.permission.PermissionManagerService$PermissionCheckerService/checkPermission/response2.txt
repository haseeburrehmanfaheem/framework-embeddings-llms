Based on the provided information, I will analyze the given API and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `checkPermission` method has three paths with depth 2, but they all seem to have similar logic and interact with the same sinks, specifically `AppOpsManager.permissionToOpCode(p1)` and `AttributionSource v12 = new AttributionSource(p2)`. These sinks are also present in the similar APIs.

The first similar API, `checkOp(ILandroid/content/AttributionSourceState;Ljava/lang/String;ZZ)I`, has a similarity score of 0.7615176439285278 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with the `AttributionSource` sink.

The second similar API, `isRegisteredAttributionSource(Landroid/content/AttributionSourceState;)Z`, has a similarity score of 0.7192584872245789 and an access control level of `NONE`. Although this API has a lower similarity score, it still interacts with the `AttributionSource` sink.

Considering the similarities between the APIs and their interactions with the same sinks, I would assign an access control level to the `checkPermission` method based on the most similar API, which is `checkOp(ILandroid/content/AttributionSourceState;Ljava/lang/String;ZZ)I`. Since this API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, I would also assign this level to the `checkPermission` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity between the APIs and their interactions with the same sinks, indicating that the `checkPermission` method requires a similar level of access control as the `checkOp` method.
