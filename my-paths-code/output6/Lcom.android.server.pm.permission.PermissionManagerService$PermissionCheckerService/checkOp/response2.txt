To determine the access control level for the `checkOp` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs. The `checkOp` method has two paths with depth 2, and both paths involve interactions with `AttributionSourceState` and `AppOpsManager`. 

The sink code provided includes lines where `Objects.requireNonNull(p2)` is called, ensuring that `p2` (an `AttributionSourceState`) is not null, and an `AttributionSource` object is created from `p2`. This operation does not inherently suggest a dangerous or system/signature-level access control since it's more about validation and creation of objects rather than accessing sensitive data or performing critical operations.

However, when looking at the similar APIs:

1. **isRegisteredAttributionSource**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it doesn't pose significant security risks. It creates an `AttributionSource` from the provided state but does not seem to interact with system-level components in a way that would require higher access control.

2. **finishDataDelivery**: This API is marked as `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting it requires either system or signature-level permissions, likely due to its interaction with sensitive data delivery and the management of attribution sources at a potentially system level.

Given these comparisons, the `checkOp` method seems to fall somewhere in between these two in terms of potential security implications. It does interact with system services (`AppOpsManager`) and performs checks that could influence app operations based on permissions or states, but it doesn't explicitly handle sensitive data or perform actions that would typically require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.

However, considering the method's interactions with system components like `AppOpsManager`, its potential to affect how applications are allowed to operate (via checking ops), and comparing it with `finishDataDelivery` which has a higher access control level due to its potentially more impactful operations on data delivery and attribution source management, one might argue that `checkOp` could require more than `NONE` level of protection.

Yet, without explicit evidence of handling sensitive information or performing dangerous operations directly (like those typically requiring `DANGEROUS` permissions), the most conservative but still reasonable assessment based on provided similar APIs would lean towards a lower risk classification. 

Given this analysis and the fact that it involves system-level checks but does not explicitly handle sensitive data in a way that's overtly dangerous or requires signature/system level access, I would classify its access control level as `NORMAL`. This reflects its need for some level of protection due to interactions with system services but does not rise to the level of requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` or clearly involving operations that are `DANGEROUS`.
