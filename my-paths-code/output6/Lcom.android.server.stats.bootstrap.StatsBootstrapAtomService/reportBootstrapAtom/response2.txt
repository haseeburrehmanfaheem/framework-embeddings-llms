To determine the access control level for the `reportBootstrapAtom` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `reportBootstrapAtom` method is used to report a bootstrap atom event. It creates a new `StatsEvent` builder, sets the atom ID, and writes the event to the `StatsLog`. The method does not seem to handle sensitive data or perform any critical operations that would require elevated permissions.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `shareData(Landroid/view/contentcapture/DataShareRequest;Landroid/view/contentcapture/IDataShareWriteAdapter;)V` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method also writes a `StatsEvent` to the `StatsLog`, but it handles more complex data, including a `DataShareRequest` and an `IDataShareWriteAdapter`. Despite this, its access control level is `NONE`.

2. `startActivityAsUser(Landroid/app/IApplicationThread;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/content/ComponentName;IZLandroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/os/Bundle;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also writes a `StatsEvent` to the `StatsLog`, but it is related to starting an activity as a specific user, which might require system or signature-level permissions.

Considering these comparisons and the fact that `reportBootstrapAtom` does not handle sensitive data or require elevated permissions, its access control level should be similar to that of `shareData`, which is `NONE`.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
