After analyzing the provided code paths for the API `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp`, I have identified potential sinks. Here is the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "LegacyPermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda6 v3 = new LegacyPermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda6(p0,p1,p2);",
      "Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity(v3);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sink set includes the creation of a new object `LegacyPermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda6` and its subsequent use with `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`. This meets the positive rule for object creation, as it involves data flow from the API parameters `p1` and `p2`, and is used in a method invocation that may have implications for access control or permission management. The `Binder.getCallingUid()` call does not directly contribute to a sink in this context because its return value is used for input validation/sanity checks, which falls under the negative rules.
