To determine the access control level for the `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method has two paths with a depth of 1. Both paths check if the calling UID (`v1`) is equal to 1001 and then perform an action using `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`. This suggests that the method is intended for use by specific UIDs, possibly system or signature-level processes.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves creating a lambda instance (`LegacyPermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda6`) and executing it with clean calling identity. This operation appears to manage permissions without directly exposing sensitive operations to arbitrary callers, indicating a need for elevated access control.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that only system or signature-level applications can call this method. Its similarity score with the target method is very high (0.9898073673248291), suggesting similar functionality and likely similar security requirements.
   - `grantDefaultPermissionsToCarrierServiceApp` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, with a high similarity score (0.9897935390472412) to the target method. This further supports the notion that these methods are intended for restricted use, possibly due to their impact on permission management.

Given this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp` method should have a similar access control level as its highly similar counterparts, which are both classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`. This classification ensures that only trusted, system-level or signature-verified applications can invoke these methods, thereby protecting sensitive permission management operations from unauthorized access.
