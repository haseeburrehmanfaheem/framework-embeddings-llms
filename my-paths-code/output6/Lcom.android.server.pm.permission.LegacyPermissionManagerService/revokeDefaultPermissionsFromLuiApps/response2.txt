To determine the access control level for the `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics and code snippets of these APIs.

1. **Similarity Scores and Access Control Levels**:
   - The API `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps` has a similarity score of 0.9957897663116455 with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The API `grantDefaultPermissionsToCarrierServiceApp` has a similarity score of 0.9948803782463074 with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Semantics and Code Snippets**:
   - Both similar APIs (`grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps` and `grantDefaultPermissionsToCarrierServiceApp`) involve granting default permissions, which is a sensitive operation typically requiring high-level access control.
   - The code snippets for these APIs show the use of `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`, which is used to perform operations with the calling identity cleared, suggesting that these operations are performed in a privileged context to manage permissions effectively.

3. **Analysis of `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps`**:
   - This method involves revoking default permissions from LUI ( Likely User Interface or Launchers and other system-level UI components) apps, which is also a sensitive operation that affects the security and functionality of the system.
   - The code snippet for `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` also utilizes `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`, similar to the provided APIs, indicating it operates in a context where permission management requires elevated privileges.

Given these considerations:
- The high similarity scores indicate that `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` shares significant functionality with the other two APIs.
- The use of `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity` in all mentioned APIs suggests they are involved in sensitive operations requiring elevated access control levels.
- Revoking permissions is a security-sensitive operation, typically requiring system or signature-level permission to perform.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` method should have an access control level similar to its highly similar counterparts, which are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
