To determine the access control level for the `reportChangeByPackageName` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `reportChangeByPackageName` method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `getApplicationInfo`: This sink is used to retrieve information about an application.
2. `shouldWriteToStatsLog`: This sink checks if a change should be written to the stats log.
3. `FrameworkStatsLog.write`: This sink writes data to the framework stats log.
4. `ChangeReporter$ChangeReport`: This sink creates a new change report.
5. `markAsReported`: This sink marks a change as reported.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `isChangeEnabledByPackageName`: This API has an access control level of `NONE` and interacts with the `getApplicationInfo` sink.
2. `reportChangeByUid`: This API has an access control level of `NONE` and interacts with the `shouldWriteToStatsLog`, `FrameworkStatsLog.write`, `ChangeReporter$ChangeReport`, and `markAsReported` sinks.

Based on the similarities between the `reportChangeByPackageName` method and the provided APIs, we can conclude that the access control level for the `reportChangeByPackageName` method is also `NONE`. This is because the method interacts with similar sinks and does not seem to perform any sensitive or dangerous operations that would require a higher access control level.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
