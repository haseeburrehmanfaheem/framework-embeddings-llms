To determine the access control level for the `isChangeEnabled` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method checks if a change is enabled based on parameters `p1` and `p2`, where `p2` is an `ApplicationInfo` object.
   - It uses `this.mCompatConfig.isChangeEnabled(p1, p2)` to determine the status of the change.
   - If `p2` is null (or 0, as indicated by the condition `if (p2 == 0)`), and the change is not enabled (`v3 == 0`), it reports the change using `this.mChangeReporter.reportChange(ApplicationInfo.uid, p1, );`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sinks involve calling `isChangeEnabled` on `mCompatConfig` and reporting changes via `mChangeReporter`.
   - These operations seem to be related to compatibility changes and reporting mechanisms within the system.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **reportChangeByUid(JI)V**: This API has a similarity score of 0.8430641889572144 with `isChangeEnabled` and is assigned an access control level of NONE.
     - It directly reports changes based on UID, which might imply that it doesn't require high-level permissions to execute its functionality since it's already tied to specific UIDs.
   - **setOverrides(Lcom/android/internal/compat/CompatibilityChangeConfig;Ljava/lang/String;)V**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7636662721633911 and is assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
     - It involves setting overrides for compatibility change configurations, which could potentially affect system behavior significantly. Thus, it requires either system or signature-level permissions.

Given the above analysis:
- The `isChangeEnabled` method primarily checks the status of a compatibility change and reports changes under specific conditions. This functionality seems to be more aligned with internal system operations rather than direct user data access or modification.
- Considering its similarity with `reportChangeByUid`, which has an access control level of NONE, it suggests that `isChangeEnabled` might not require high-level permissions for its basic operation. However, the involvement of system configurations and reporting could imply a need for some level of access control.

**Decision**: Given the method's functionality is closely related to system compatibility configurations and change reporting, which does not directly involve sensitive user data but still pertains to system internals, it seems most appropriate to assign an access control level that reflects its need for protection against unauthorized access while acknowledging its system-oriented nature.

Therefore, considering the provided similarities and the nature of the method's operations, the final access control level for the `isChangeEnabled` API could be considered as **NORMAL**, reflecting a balance between the need for some level of protection due to its interaction with system configurations and the relatively lower risk compared to operations directly affecting sensitive user data or requiring system-level modifications.
