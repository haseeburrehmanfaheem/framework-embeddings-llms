To determine the access control level for the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that interact with the same sinks. The given code snippets show interactions with package management services and compatibility configurations.

### Analysis of Code Paths

1. **Path 1**: This path involves retrieving an application's information using `getApplicationInfo`, checking if a specific change is enabled for that application, and evaluating overrides. It does not directly modify system settings but retrieves information based on the package name and a change identifier.
2. **Path 2 and Path 3**: These paths are similar in structure and involve getting an application's information and then checking if a compatibility change is enabled using `mCompatConfig.isChangeEnabled`. If not, it reports the change.

### Similar APIs Analysis

1. **`reportChangeByPackageName` (Access Control Level: NONE)**: This API also interacts with package management services but specifically focuses on reporting changes by package name. Its access control level being `NONE` suggests that reporting changes does not require special permissions.
2. **`getFrontActivityScreenCompatMode` (Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG)**: This method deals with compatibility modes for the front activity screen and has a higher access control level due to its system or signature-level requirements, possibly because it involves more sensitive operations related to screen compatibility.

### Conclusion

Given that `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` primarily focuses on checking if a change is enabled by package name without modifying critical system settings directly (like changing permissions or altering system configurations), and considering the similarities with `reportChangeByPackageName`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level. The method does not appear to perform operations that would require `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` levels, as those typically involve more intrusive system modifications or sensitive data access.

However, since the method interacts with package management and compatibility configurations, which might be considered sensitive in certain contexts, assigning it a level of `NONE` seems appropriate given its read-only nature and comparison with similar APIs. It doesn't fit well into the `DANGEROUS` category as it's not directly altering system settings or user data in a way that would pose significant risk.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the nature of the method's operations:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's primary function being to retrieve status information about compatibility changes for an application package, which does not inherently require elevated permissions or pose significant security risks.
