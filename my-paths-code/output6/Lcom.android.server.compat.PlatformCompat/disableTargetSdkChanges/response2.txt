To determine the access control level for the `disableTargetSdkChanges` method, let's analyze its code paths and sinks in relation to the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths and Sinks Analysis:**
   - The `disableTargetSdkChanges` method involves several operations, including file management (creating, renaming, deleting files) and interactions with the `ActivityManager` service to kill a UID.
   - The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` when interacting with the `ActivityManager`, indicating it is performing actions that require careful identity management.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis:**
   - **API Name: `clearOverride(JLjava/lang/String;)Z`** 
     - Access Control Level: `SYS_OR_SIG`
     - This API interacts with the `ActivityManager` to kill a UID, similar to one of the sinks in `disableTargetSdkChanges`. The access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission.
   - **API Name: `enableTargetSdkChanges(Ljava/lang/String;I)I`**
     - Access Control Level: `SYS_OR_SIG`
     - This API involves creating a file and writing to it using an `XmlWriter`, similar to another sink in `disableTargetSdkChanges`. Again, the access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and considering the operations performed by `disableTargetSdkChanges` (interacting with system services like `ActivityManager`, managing files which could impact system behavior, and using `Binder` identity management), it's reasonable to conclude that `disableTargetSdkChanges` also requires a similar level of access control.

The final answer is: 
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
