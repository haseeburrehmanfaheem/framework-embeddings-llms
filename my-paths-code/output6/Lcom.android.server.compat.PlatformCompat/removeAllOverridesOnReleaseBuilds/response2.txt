To assign an access control level to the `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels. The method interacts with file operations (reading, writing, renaming, and deleting) and uses `XmlWriter` to write data to a file.

The two similar APIs provided are:

1. `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It performs operations like renaming files, creating new files, and writing to them using `PrintWriter` and `XmlWriter`.
2. `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`: This API also has an access control level of `NONE`. It involves creating a new `Overrides` object, getting change overrides, and writing data to a file using `PrintWriter` and `XmlWriter`.

Both of these similar APIs have a `NONE` access control level, indicating that they do not pose significant risks or require special permissions. They primarily deal with file operations within the app's context, which are common in many Android applications.

The `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method also deals with file operations (creating, deleting, renaming) and uses `XmlWriter` to write data to files. These operations are similar in nature to those found in the provided APIs with `NONE` access control levels. 

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method should have a similar access control level because it doesn't appear to perform any actions that would require elevated permissions or pose significant risks beyond what is already seen in the compared APIs.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its operations:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This conclusion assumes that the method's primary interactions are with files within the app's domain and do not access sensitive user data or perform actions that could compromise device security without appropriate permissions.
