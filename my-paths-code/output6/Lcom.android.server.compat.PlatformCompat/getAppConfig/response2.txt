To determine the access control level for the `getAppConfig` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getAppConfig` method returns a `CompatibilityChangeConfig` object after initializing it with two empty `HashSet` instances (`v3` and `v5`). This operation does not seem to involve any sensitive data or operations that could potentially harm the system or leak user data.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `setOverrides` method has a similarity score of 0.7572832107543945 with `getAppConfig`. It is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, possibly due to its ability to modify override configurations.
   - The `listAllChanges` method has a similarity score of 0.7399019598960876 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This method returns information about compatibility changes without modifying any data or accessing sensitive information.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet provided focuses on the creation of `HashSet`, `Compatibility$ChangeConfig`, and `CompatibilityChangeConfig` objects, which are used within the `getAppConfig` method to generate its return value. This process does not inherently suggest a dangerous or system-sensitive operation.

Considering these points:
- **Dangerous Operations**: The method does not seem to perform any operations that could be considered dangerous (like accessing sensitive user data, making significant system changes, etc.).
- **System or Signature Level Access**: Unlike `setOverrides`, there's no clear indication that `getAppConfig` requires system-level permissions to operate effectively.
- **Normal Operations**: The method involves creating and returning a configuration object based on predefined compatibility change configurations, which can be considered a normal operation within the context of managing application compatibility.

Given the above analysis and comparing it with the provided similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getAppConfig` seems to be `NONE`, as it doesn't appear to perform any sensitive or system-altering operations that would necessitate higher access control levels like `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS`.
