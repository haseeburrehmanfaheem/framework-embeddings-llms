To determine the access control level for the `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The method interacts with file operations (rename, delete, create) on `mOverridesFile` and `mBackupOverridesFile`, and it involves writing to these files using `XmlWriter`. It also accesses and modifies data related to compatibility overrides (`CompatibilityOverridesToRemoveConfig`, `Overrides`, `ChangeIdStateCache`). These operations could potentially impact the system's configuration or data integrity.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9708646535873413) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Its code snippet shows interactions with overrides and file operations similar to `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, but without the rename or delete operations on files.
   - **enableTargetSdkChanges**: This API has a slightly lower similarity score (0.9432028532028198) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves creating a file and writing to it, which shares some similarities with the file operations in `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`.

Given these observations:
- The method `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` performs significant file operations (delete, rename, create) and data modifications that could affect system compatibility configurations.
- While `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` has a similar purpose and is assigned `NONE`, the additional file system operations in `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` (like delete and rename) suggest a potential for higher risk or impact on system integrity.
- The `enableTargetSdkChanges` API, with its `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicates that operations affecting system configurations or files require at least signature or system-level permissions.

Considering the file operations and data modifications involved in `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, and comparing it with the similar APIs provided, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method's interactions with the file system (rename, delete, create) and its impact on compatibility configurations suggest that it should be restricted to system or signature-level access to prevent unauthorized modifications.
