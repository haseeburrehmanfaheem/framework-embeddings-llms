After analyzing the provided information, I will assign an access control level to the `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` API.

The API interacts with file systems by creating, deleting, and writing files. This kind of interaction is typically considered sensitive and requires proper permission control. However, looking at the similar APIs (`removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` and `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`) provided, both have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with file systems in a similar manner.

Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that the interactions with the file system in this context might not be considered sensitive enough to require a higher access control level like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`. The `NORMAL` access control level usually applies to APIs that can pose a risk if used improperly but do not directly interact with sensitive data or operations. However, without explicit evidence of potential risks or the need for specific permissions (like those required for dangerous operations), and considering the similarity with other APIs labeled as `NONE`, it's reasonable to align the access control level of `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` with that of its similar counterparts.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, I conclude that the appropriate access control level for the `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` API is `NONE`.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
