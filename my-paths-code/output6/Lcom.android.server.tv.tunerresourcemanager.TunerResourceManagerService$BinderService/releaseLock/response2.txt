To assign an access control level to the `releaseLock` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided `releaseLock` method has a similarity score of 0.9015816450119019 with the `acquireLock(IJ)Z` API, which has an access control level of `NONE`. Both methods interact with the same sink, `TunerResourceManagerService.lockForTunerApiLock()`, and have similar logic.

Given this information, we can infer that the `releaseLock` method is likely to have a similar access control level as the `acquireLock(IJ)Z` API. Since both methods seem to be managing locks and do not appear to pose any significant security risks or require special permissions, it's reasonable to assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `releaseLock` method.

Here is the final access control level for the `releaseLock` API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
