To assign an access control level to the `restoreResourceMap` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `restoreResourceMap` API has a simple conditional statement that checks if the input parameter `p1` is equal to 0. If true, it calls four methods from the `TunerResourceManagerService` class to restore resource maps and counts.

The similar APIs provided are `clearResourceMap` and `storeResourceMap`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with the same `TunerResourceManagerService` class, but with different method calls and parameters.

Comparing the code snippets, we can see that:

* `clearResourceMap` sets resource maps and counts to 0, which is a simple reset operation.
* `storeResourceMap` stores the current resource maps and counts in backup variables, which is a preparation step for potential restoration.
* `restoreResourceMap` restores resource maps and counts from backup variables, which is the inverse operation of `storeResourceMap`.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that `restoreResourceMap` also requires minimal access control. The operations performed by this API do not seem to pose a significant risk or require special permissions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons with similar APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `restoreResourceMap` API:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
