To analyze the provided code for potential sinks that require access control, we must carefully examine each step in the execution to understand how data flows through the API and how different methods interact with parameters or other data.

The given method is `restoreResourceMap(int p1)`, which does not return any value but performs several operations based on the input parameter `p1`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first line, `Object v2 = this.mLock;`, seems to be accessing an object lock. This operation is auxiliary and doesn't directly contribute to identifying sinks according to the provided rules.

2. The conditional statement `if (p1 == 0)` checks the value of `p1` and executes a block of code if true. Inside this block, four method invocations from `TunerResourceManagerService` are made:
   - `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeResourceMap(this.mFrontendResourcesBackup, this.mFrontendResources);`
   - `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts(this.mFrontendExistingNumsBackup, this.mFrontendExistingNums);`
   - `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts(this.mFrontendUsedNumsBackup, this.mFrontendUsedNums);`
   - `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts(this.mFrontendMaxUsableNumsBackup, this.mFrontendMaxUsableNums);`

These method invocations do not directly follow the naming similarity rule with the API name `restoreResourceMap`, nor do they take the input parameter `p1` as an argument. However, they are modifying fields (`this.mFrontendResources`, `this.mFrontendExistingNums`, `this.mFrontendUsedNums`, and `this.mFrontendMaxUsableNums`) with values from their respective backup fields. This modification can be considered under the rule for field set cases because these operations are directly related to the method's functionality and involve data flow influenced by the API's parameters indirectly through conditional execution.

Given the rules, the most relevant instructions contributing to potential sinks in this context would involve the invocations of `TunerResourceManagerService` methods, as they represent modifications based on the input condition. However, these do not perfectly fit into any single category for sinks without considering the broader context of data flow and access control requirements.

Since there's no direct creation or return of objects that follow the naming similarity with the API or are created with a data flow from the API parameters in a straightforward manner, and considering the invocations don't directly take `p1` as an argument but do affect state based on its value, we must carefully categorize these operations.

Here's how you might represent this analysis in JSON format, focusing on the method invocations that collectively contribute to modifying the resource map state:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeResourceMap(this.mFrontendResourcesBackup, this.mFrontendResources);",
      "TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts(this.mFrontendExistingNumsBackup, this.mFrontendExistingNums);",
      "TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts(this.mFrontendUsedNumsBackup, this.mFrontendUsedNums);",
      "TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts(this.mFrontendMaxUsableNumsBackup, this.mFrontendMaxUsableNums);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This representation highlights the set of instructions that modify the state based on the input parameter `p1`, emphasizing their role in collectively contributing to a potential sink related to resource map restoration. However, note that this analysis hinges on interpreting the rules provided and might require further context for a comprehensive security assessment.
