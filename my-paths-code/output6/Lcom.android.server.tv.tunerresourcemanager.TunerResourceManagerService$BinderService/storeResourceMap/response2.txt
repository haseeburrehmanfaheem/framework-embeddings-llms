To determine the access control level for the `storeResourceMap` API, we should analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs (`restoreResourceMap` and `clearResourceMap`) along with their access control levels.

1. **Behavior Analysis of `storeResourceMap`:**
   - The method takes an integer parameter `p1`.
   - If `p1` equals 0, it swaps the contents of several frontend resource maps (existing, used, max usable numbers) and their backups using `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeResourceMap` and `replaceFeCounts`. This essentially backs up or restores the current state of resources based on the input parameter.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`restoreResourceMap(I)V`:** 
     - Access Control Level: NONE
     - Behavior: Restores the resource maps from their backups to the originals.
   - **`clearResourceMap(I)V`:**
     - Access Control Level: NONE
     - Behavior: Clears (sets to 0) the resource maps.

3. **Access Control Considerations:**
   - The provided APIs (`restoreResourceMap` and `clearResourceMap`) both have an access control level of NONE, indicating that they do not pose significant risks or handle sensitive information directly.
   - `storeResourceMap`, when `p1 == 0`, essentially performs a similar operation to `restoreResourceMap` but in the context of backing up current states. This does not inherently suggest an elevation of risk compared to restoring from backups.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Given that `storeResourceMap` operates within the same domain as `restoreResourceMap` and `clearResourceMap`, and considering its functionality does not introduce new risks (such as accessing sensitive data, modifying system settings directly, etc.) beyond what is already present in the similar APIs with NONE access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that `storeResourceMap` should also be assigned an access control level of NONE.

**Final Access Control Level:**
