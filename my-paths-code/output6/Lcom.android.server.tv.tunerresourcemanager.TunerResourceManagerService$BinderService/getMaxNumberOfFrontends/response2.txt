To determine the access control level for the `getMaxNumberOfFrontends` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths, all of which involve retrieving values from `mFrontendExistingNums` and `mFrontendMaxUsableNums` based on an input parameter `p2`. The return value is either `-1`, `v6` (the existing number), or `v7` (the maximum usable number). There's no modification of external state or sensitive data; it's a getter method.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show the retrieval and potential return of values from `mFrontendExistingNums` and `mFrontendMaxUsableNums`. This reinforces that the method is about retrieving information without altering any state.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **setMaxNumberOfFrontends(II)Z**: Despite having a high similarity score, this API sets values in `mFrontendMaxUsableNums` based on input parameters. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that setting these values does not require special permissions or pose significant risks.

Given these points:

- The method is a getter and does not modify any state.
- It retrieves information from internal data structures without accessing sensitive user data or external systems directly.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores that do modify state have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that interactions with these specific data structures (`mFrontendMaxUsableNums`) are considered safe.

Based on the above analysis, since the method is a getter and does not pose any risk by modifying sensitive data or requiring special permissions to execute its functionality, it should be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
