To determine the access control level for the `clearResourceMap` method, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Behavior of `clearResourceMap`:** This method takes an integer parameter `p1`. If `p1` is 0, it clears or resets the resource maps by calling `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeResourceMap` and `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts` with a value of 0 for all frontend resources, existing numbers, used numbers, and maximum usable numbers. This suggests that the method is involved in managing or resetting the state of tuner resources.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **restoreResourceMap(I)V:** This method restores the resource map from a backup. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not pose significant risks in terms of security or privacy.
   - **storeResourceMap(I)V:** Similar to `restoreResourceMap`, this method stores the current state of the resource map into a backup, also with an access control level of `NONE`.

Given these observations:
- All methods interact with tuner resource management services but do not directly handle sensitive user data or perform actions that could compromise system security.
- The similar APIs (`restoreResourceMap` and `storeResourceMap`) have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to managing tuner resources are considered low-risk.

**Conclusion:** Based on the behavior of `clearResourceMap` and the comparison with similar APIs, it appears that this method is involved in a low-risk operation related to resetting or clearing resource maps. Therefore, it does not require high-level access control.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
