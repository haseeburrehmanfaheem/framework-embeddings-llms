To determine the access control level for the `onPendingSaveUi` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onPendingSaveUi` method involves several operations, including checking the validity of the input parameters (`p1` and `p2`), acquiring a lock (`AbstractMasterSystemService.mLock`), retrieving the user ID of the calling user (`UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`), and interacting with an `AutoFillUI` object. The critical parts here are the interaction with system services (like getting the calling user ID) and the use of locks, which can have implications for security and privacy.

2. **Sink Code**: The provided sink code snippets indicate interactions that could potentially be sensitive:
   - `Object v1 = Objects.requireNonNull(p2, "token");` ensures that `p2` is not null, which is a basic sanity check but does not directly imply a specific access control level.
   - `Integer v3 = Integer.valueOf(p1);` converts an integer to an Integer object, which is also a neutral operation in terms of access control.
   - `AutoFillUI v25 = Session.getUiForShowing(); v25.onPendingSaveUi(p1, p2);` involves calling another method on an `AutoFillUI` object, which might imply some level of interaction with user interface elements or personal data.
   - The retrieval of the calling user ID (`int v6 = UserHandle.getCallingUserId();`) and peeking at a service for that user (`AbstractPerUserSystemService v8 = this.this$0.peekServiceForUserLocked(v6);`) are operations that involve user-specific data and thus might require careful access control.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**: The two similar APIs provided, `getUserDataId` and `getAutofillServiceComponentName`, both have an access control level of `NONE`. They also interact with the concept of user IDs and services in a manner similar to the `onPendingSaveUi` method, specifically by calling `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` and `peekServiceForUserLocked`. The fact that these operations are deemed to require no specific access control (`NONE`) suggests that the system trusts the caller to perform such queries without risking security or privacy breaches.

Given this analysis, we can infer the following:
- The operations performed by `onPendingSaveUi` do involve user-specific data and interactions with system services.
- However, similar APIs that perform analogous operations are classified as requiring `NONE` access control level, indicating that these types of operations are considered safe or not sensitive enough to warrant stricter access controls.

Therefore, considering the code's functionality, the sink points, and especially the access control levels of the similar APIs (`getUserDataId` and `getAutofillServiceComponentName`), it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `onPendingSaveUi`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
