To assign an access control level to the `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method has three paths, but all of them involve checking the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and comparing it with `ApplicationInfo.uid`. If they match, the method proceeds to perform certain actions, such as disabling owned autofill services, logging metrics, and updating settings.

The sink code snippet reveals two important operations:

1. `AbstractPerUserSystemService v3 = this.this$0.peekServiceForUserLocked(p1);`: This line retrieves a service instance for a specific user.
2. `boolean v26 = Settings$Secure.putStringForUser(v25, "autofill_service", 0, AbstractPerUserSystemService.mUserId);`: This line updates a secure setting related to autofill services.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. Let's examine their code:

1. `updateSession`: This method also uses `peekServiceForUserLocked` and checks the calling UID using `IAutoFillManager$Stub.getCallingUid()`.
2. `isFieldClassificationEnabled`: This method uses `peekServiceForUserLocked` as well, but it doesn't explicitly check the calling UID.

Despite the similarities, the `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method performs a more sensitive operation by updating secure settings related to autofill services. However, the access control level of similar APIs is `NONE`, suggesting that the Android framework does not consider this operation to be highly privileged or restricted.

Considering these factors, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method, as it performs a moderately sensitive operation but still requires some level of access control.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment reflects a balanced approach, taking into account the method's functionality, similar APIs, and the Android framework's security model.
