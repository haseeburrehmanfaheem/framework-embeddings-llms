To determine the access control level for the `clearVcnConfig` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves several checks and operations, including getting the caller's UID, checking if the user is a system user, retrieving provisioning package names, and enforcing primary user privileges. It also interacts with subscription management and telephony services.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code points involve getting the caller's UID, checking system user status, interacting with configurations, and checking carrier privileges for a package.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getConfiguredSubscriptionGroups`: This API has an access control level of NONE. It involves getting the calling UID, checking if the user is a system user, and listing configured subscription groups.
   - `showToolbar`: Also with an access control level of NONE, it involves getting the calling UID and rendering a selection toolbar.

Given these points:

- The `clearVcnConfig` method performs operations that are related to network and subscription management, which could potentially impact system settings or user data. 
- It checks for system user status and enforces primary user privileges, indicating some level of access control.
- However, the similar APIs provided (`getConfiguredSubscriptionGroups` and `showToolbar`) both have an access control level of NONE, suggesting that operations related to configuration retrieval or UI rendering do not necessarily require high-level permissions in this context.

Considering the depth of operations (involving system settings and potentially sensitive data like subscription information) but also taking into account the similarity with other APIs that have no strict access control, we can infer the following:

- The method does interact with potentially sensitive information (subscription configurations, carrier privileges), which might suggest a need for some level of access control.
- However, the absence of explicit permission checks beyond system user status and primary user enforcement, combined with the comparison to similar APIs with NONE access control level, suggests that it may not require the highest level of access control (like DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG).

Therefore, considering the balance between the potential sensitivity of the operations performed by `clearVcnConfig` and the precedent set by similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level seems to be **NORMAL**. This reflects a moderate level of protection, acknowledging the method's interactions with system settings and user data without necessitating the highest levels of permission or system/signature-level access control.
