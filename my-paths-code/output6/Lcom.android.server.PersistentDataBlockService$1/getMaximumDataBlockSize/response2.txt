Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `getMaximumDataBlockSize` method.

The method has two paths with similar code, and both call `PersistentDataBlockService.getBlockDeviceSize()` to get the block device size. This suggests that the method is interacting with a sensitive resource, which may require some level of access control.

Looking at the similar APIs, we have:

* `getOemUnlockEnabled()Z` with an access control level of `NONE`. This API also interacts with `PersistentDataBlockService.getBlockDeviceSize()` and reads data from a file.
* `write([B)I` with an access control level of `NONE`. This API calls `PersistentDataBlockService.getBlockDeviceSize()` and writes data to a block device.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that they do not require any specific permissions or access control. However, it's worth noting that these APIs may still be interacting with sensitive resources, but the access control level is set to `NONE` likely because they are designed to be accessible without restrictions.

Considering the semantics of the `getMaximumDataBlockSize` method and its interaction with `PersistentDataBlockService.getBlockDeviceSize()`, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of `NONE`. The method appears to be providing information about the block device size, which may not require any specific permissions or access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getMaximumDataBlockSize` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
