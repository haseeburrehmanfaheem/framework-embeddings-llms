To determine the access control level for the `getDataBlockSize` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getDataBlockSize` method has a check for the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and then calls `this.this$0.enforceUid(v4)`, which suggests that it enforces some kind of permission or access control based on the UID. This is similar to the provided APIs, `registerRemoteAnimationsForDisplay` and `queryStatsForUser`, which also check the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()`.

The similarity score between `getDataBlockSize` and these two APIs is high (0.8804649114608765), indicating that they share similar code patterns or structures.

Both `registerRemoteAnimationsForDisplay` and `queryStatsForUser` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies that they require either system-level privileges or a signature-level permission to access the functionality.

Given these similarities, it is reasonable to conclude that `getDataBlockSize` should also have a similar access control level. The method's interaction with file input streams and data block services suggests that it may be accessing sensitive data or performing privileged operations, which would align with the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `getDataBlockSize` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
