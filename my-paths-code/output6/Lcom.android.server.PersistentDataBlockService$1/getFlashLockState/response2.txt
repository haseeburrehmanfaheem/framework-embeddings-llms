To determine the access control level for the `getFlashLockState` method, we need to analyze its code snippets and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `getFlashLockState` method has three paths, but all of them involve reading a system property (`ro.boot.flash.locked`) using `SystemProperties.get()` and then checking if the value equals "0" or "1". The return values are either 0, 1, or -1, depending on the path.

The sink code provided is:
```java
String v2 = SystemProperties.get("ro.boot.flash.locked");
boolean v4 = v2.equals("0");
```
This sink code is similar to the code in the provided APIs, which also read the `ro.boot.flash.locked` system property and check its value.

The two similar APIs, `isDeviceOemUnlocked()Z`, have an access control level of `NONE`. Their code snippets are:
```java
String v2 = SystemProperties.get("ro.boot.flash.locked");
boolean v4 = v2.equals("0");
if (v4 != 0) { return 0; }
```
and
```java
String v2 = SystemProperties.get("ro.boot.flash.locked");
boolean v4 = v2.equals("0");
if (v4 != 0) { return 1; }
```
These APIs are similar to the `getFlashLockState` method in terms of their functionality, as they all read the same system property and check its value.

Given this information, we can conclude that the `getFlashLockState` method has a similar level of access control as the provided APIs. Since the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it is likely that the `getFlashLockState` method also has an access control level of `NONE`.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
