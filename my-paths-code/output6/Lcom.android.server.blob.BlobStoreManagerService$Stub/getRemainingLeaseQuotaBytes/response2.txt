To assign an access control level to the `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets for `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` show that it:

1. Calls `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the UID of the calling process.
2. Retrieves application data bytes limit using `BlobStoreConfig.getAppDataBytesLimit()`.
3. Gets total usage bytes locked by calling `BlobStoreManagerService.getTotalUsageBytesLocked(p2, p3)`.
4. Performs a calculation and returns a value based on the comparison of the limit and total usage.

The sink code highlights the key operations involving data limits and usage.

Comparing this with similar APIs:

- `getCacheQuotaBytes(Ljava/lang/String;I)J` has a similarity score of 0.7524653673171997 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also deals with quota bytes, suggesting that operations related to data quotas or limits might require higher access control due to their potential impact on system resources or security.
- `getDataBlockSize()I` has a similarity score of 0.7272739410400391 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves getting the total data size, which is related to data management and potentially sensitive operations.

Given these comparisons:

- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are considered sensitive or system-level operations.
- The operations within `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` involve checking and calculating based on application data limits and usage, which could be considered sensitive in terms of managing resources or enforcing quotas.

Therefore, considering the similarities with other APIs that have been classified as requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access control due to their involvement in system-level or sensitive operations, it's reasonable to conclude that `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` should also be assigned a similar level of access control.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
