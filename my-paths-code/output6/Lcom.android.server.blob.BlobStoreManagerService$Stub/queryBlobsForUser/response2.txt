To assign an access control level to the `queryBlobsForUser` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `queryBlobsForUser` method has two paths:

1. The first path checks if the input parameter `p1` is not equal to `-2`. If true, it gets the current user using `ActivityManager.getCurrentUser()`, ensures that the user is not a special user using `ensureNotSpecialUser()`, and then queries blobs using `BlobStoreManagerService.forEachBlobLocked()`.
2. The second path also checks if `p1` is not equal to `-2`. If true, it ensures that the user is not a special user using `ensureNotSpecialUser()` and then queries blobs using `BlobStoreManagerService.forEachBlobLocked()`.

The similar APIs provided are:

* `unregisterAppLinkInfo`: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and interacts with the `ActivityManager` to handle incoming users and bind services.
* `sendSigningResult`: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and also interacts with the `ActivityManager` to handle incoming users and get or create user states.

Comparing the code of `queryBlobsForUser` with the similar APIs, we can see that it does not perform any sensitive operations that require a high access control level like `SYS_OR_SIG`. The method only queries blobs for a given user, which seems to be a relatively benign operation.

However, the method does use `ActivityManager.getCurrentUser()` and `ensureNotSpecialUser()`, which suggests that it may need some level of access control to ensure that the querying user is authorized. But since it does not perform any operations that can affect the system or other users, an access control level of `NORMAL` seems appropriate.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `queryBlobsForUser` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
