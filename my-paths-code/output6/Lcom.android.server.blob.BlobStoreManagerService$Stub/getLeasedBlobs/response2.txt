To determine the access control level for the `getLeasedBlobs` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis of `getLeasedBlobs`:**
   - The method takes a `String` parameter (`packageName`) and returns a `List`.
   - It checks if the `packageName` is null and throws an exception if it is.
   - It gets the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()`, which suggests that it's considering the caller's identity, potentially for access control or logging purposes.
   - It then iterates over blobs using `BlobStoreManagerService.forEachBlobLocked(v11)`, where `v11` is a lambda function that involves the provided package name and the list to be returned (`v9`).
   - The method returns the list of leased blobs.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`deleteBlob(J)V`:** This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It removes entries from a map based on certain conditions, which involves direct manipulation of data.
   - **`queryBlobsForUser(I)Ljava/util/List;`:** This method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It queries blobs for a specific user and returns a list. The method includes a check to ensure the caller is not a special user (`v2.ensureNotSpecialUser()`), indicating access control.

3. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   - Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests they require either system or signature-level permission to execute.
   - The `getLeasedBlobs` method, while it involves iteration and return of leased blobs based on a package name, does not explicitly show dangerous operations like data manipulation (as seen in `deleteBlob`) or user-specific queries with special user checks (as in `queryBlobsForUser`).
   - However, given its interaction with system-level components (like `Binder.getCallingUid()` and iteration over blobs which might be a sensitive operation), it likely requires more than `NONE` level access control.
   - Considering the operations involved and comparing with the similar APIs provided, `getLeasedBlobs` seems to require access control that is at least as restrictive as `SYS_OR_SIG`, given its potential impact on system resources or data.

**Conclusion:**
Given the analysis above, the most appropriate access control level for the `getLeasedBlobs` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, considering its interactions with system components and the need to protect the integrity of leased blobs data.
