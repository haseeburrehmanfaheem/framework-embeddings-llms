To assign an access control level to the `deleteBlob` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `deleteBlob` method removes a blob from the `mBlobsMap` and then calls `writeBlobsInfoAsync()` to update the blobs information. This operation seems to be related to managing internal storage or caching mechanisms.

Let's review the similar APIs:

1. `abandonSession(JLjava/lang/String;)V`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and writes blob sessions asynchronously using `writeBlobSessionsAsync()`. The similarity score with `deleteBlob` is 0.8953877091407776, indicating a strong resemblance in functionality.
2. `getLeasedBlobs(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/List;`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and iterates over blobs using `forEachBlobLocked()`. The similarity score with `deleteBlob` is 0.7868897318840027, indicating a moderate resemblance in functionality.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system-level or signature-level permissions to execute. Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that `deleteBlob` also interacts with internal storage mechanisms, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `deleteBlob`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `deleteBlob` method.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
