The method deleteBlob has the following code snippet:

This is path 1 for the API with depth 2:
public void deleteBlob(long p1){
	Set v4 = this.mBlobsMap.entrySet();
	BlobStoreManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8 v5 = new BlobStoreManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8(BlobStoreManagerService,p2);
	boolean v7 = v4.removeIf(v5);
	BlobStoreManagerService.writeBlobsInfoAsync();
	return;
}

and the following sink code:
['Set v4 = this.mBlobsMap.entrySet();\nBlobStoreManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8 v5 = new BlobStoreManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8(BlobStoreManagerService,p2);\nboolean v7 = v4.removeIf(v5);', 'BlobStoreManagerService.writeBlobsInfoAsync();']
