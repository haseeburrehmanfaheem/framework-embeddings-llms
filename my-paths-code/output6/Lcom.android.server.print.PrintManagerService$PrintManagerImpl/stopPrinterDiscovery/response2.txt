To determine the access control level for the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two code paths, but both involve similar operations such as checking user states, removing printer discovery tokens, and handling binder identities. These operations are related to managing printer discovery sessions and user interactions with printers.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets highlight key operations:
   - Creating a new `UserState` object and putting it into `mUserStates`.
   - Removing an `IBinder` (representing a printer discovery observer) from `mStartedPrinterDiscoveryTokens`.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `stopPrinterStateTracking`: Has a similarity score of 0.8631 with the method in question, and its access control level is NONE. This API also involves creating a `UserState` object and putting it into `mUserStates`, similar to the sink code.
   - `getCustomPrinterIcon`: With a similarity score of 0.8598, this API has an access control level of NONE as well. It involves creating a `UserState` object and interacts with remote print spooler services.

Given these points:

- The operations in `stopPrinterDiscovery` (managing user states and printer discovery sessions) do not directly imply a need for elevated permissions or sensitive data access that would categorize it under DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG.
- The similarity with other APIs (`stopPrinterStateTracking` and `getCustomPrinterIcon`) which have an access control level of NONE, suggests that the operations performed by `stopPrinterDiscovery` are likely routine management tasks within the printer service framework.
- There's no indication in the provided code paths or similar APIs that this method directly handles sensitive user data, performs actions requiring system-level permissions, or interacts with system-critical components in a way that would necessitate higher access control levels.

Based on these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `stopPrinterDiscovery` seems to be NONE, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs and reflects the nature of its operations within the context provided.
