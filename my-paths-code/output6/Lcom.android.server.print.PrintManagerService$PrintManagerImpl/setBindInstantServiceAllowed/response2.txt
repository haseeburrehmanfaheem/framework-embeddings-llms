To assign an access control level to the `setBindInstantServiceAllowed` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `setBindInstantServiceAllowed` method has two paths with depth 2, but both paths have the same logic. The method checks if a user is unlocking or unlocked using `this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1)`. If the user is unlocked, it creates a new `UserState` object and updates the `mUserStates` map.

The sink code includes three lines:
1. `UserState v6 = new UserState(this.mContext,p1,this.mLock,p2);` - This line creates a new `UserState` object.
2. `this.mUserStates.put(p1, v6);` - This line updates the `mUserStates` map with the new `UserState` object.
3. `boolean v4 = this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1);` - This line checks if a user is unlocking or unlocked.
4. `this.mIsInstantServiceAllowed = p2;` - This line updates the `mIsInstantServiceAllowed` flag.

The similar APIs, `stopPrinterStateTracking` and `startPrinterStateTracking`, have an access control level of `NONE`. They also use `this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1)` to check if a user is unlocking or unlocked.

Considering the similarity in code and logic between `setBindInstantServiceAllowed` and the similar APIs, it can be inferred that the access control level for `setBindInstantServiceAllowed` should also be `NONE`. The method seems to be managing internal states based on user unlock status and does not appear to pose a significant security risk.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
