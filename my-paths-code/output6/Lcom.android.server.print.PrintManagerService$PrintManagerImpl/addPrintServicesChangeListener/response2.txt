To determine the access control level for the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two code paths with similar operations, including creating a new `UserState` object and adding it to `mUserStates`, or creating a `UserState$3` object and adding it to `mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords`. Both paths involve interactions that seem to be related to managing user states or listener records, which are internal to the system's print service management.

2. **Sink Code**: The identified sinks in the code snippets are:
   - `UserState v10 = new UserState(this.mContext,p1,this.mLock,p2); this.mUserStates.put(p1, v10);`
   - `UserState$3 v19 = new UserState$3(UserState,p1); boolean v21 = this.mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords.add(v19);`

   These operations are about managing user states and listener records. They don't seem to directly access sensitive user data or perform dangerous operations that could compromise the system's security.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `startPrinterDiscovery(Landroid/print/IPrinterDiscoveryObserver;Ljava/util/List;I)V` with an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `stopPrinterStateTracking(Landroid/print/PrinterId;I)V` also with an access control level of `NONE`.

   Both similar APIs have been assigned the `NONE` access control level, suggesting that their operations do not pose significant security risks. Their code snippets show interactions with user states or printer state tracking, which are comparable to the operations in `addPrintServicesChangeListener`.

Given this analysis:

- The method `addPrintServicesChangeListener` seems to be involved in managing print services and listener records, which is similar to the operations of the provided APIs (`startPrinterDiscovery` and `stopPrinterStateTracking`) that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
- There's no indication in the provided code or analysis that this method accesses sensitive data, performs dangerous operations, or requires special system privileges that would necessitate a higher access control level like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if we consider `NONE` as the baseline for minimal risk.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its operations, the most appropriate access control level for the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` method would be `NONE`.
