Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `createPrinterDiscoverySession` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `createPrinterDiscoverySession` method has two paths with depth 2, but both paths have similar code structures and sink codes. The sink codes are:

1. `Object v8 = this.mUserStates.get(p1);`
2. `UserState v9 = new UserState(this.mContext, p1, this.mLock, p2);`
3. `this.mUserStates.put(p1, v9);`
4. `boolean v7 = this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1);`

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `stopPrinterStateTracking(Landroid/print/PrinterId;I)V` with a similarity score of 1.0000001192092896 and an access control level of NONE.
2. `startPrinterStateTracking(Landroid/print/PrinterId;I)V` with a similarity score of 1.0000001192092896 and an access control level of NONE.

Both similar APIs have the same code snippet: `boolean v7 = this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1);`, which is also present in the `createPrinterDiscoverySession` method. This suggests that the access control level for `createPrinterDiscoverySession` should be consistent with the similar APIs.

Given the similarity in code structure and sink codes, I conclude that the access control level for the `createPrinterDiscoverySession` method should be NONE, as it is consistent with the similar APIs provided.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
