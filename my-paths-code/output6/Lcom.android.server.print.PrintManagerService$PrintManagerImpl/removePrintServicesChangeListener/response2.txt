To determine the access control level for the `removePrintServicesChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The API `removePrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` has a similarity score of 1.0 with `removePrintServicesChangeListener` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations closely related to managing listeners or changes in the print service context may require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on system functionality and security.
   - The API `cancelPrintJob` has a slightly lower similarity score (0.99554443359375) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This indicates that not all print-related operations require elevated permissions, especially those that might be more user-facing or less critical to system integrity.

2. **Code Snippets and Sinks:**
   - The provided code snippets for `removePrintServicesChangeListener` show interactions with `UserManager` (to check if a user is unlocking or unlocked) and manipulation of `UserState` objects within `mUserStates`. These operations imply handling of sensitive user data and system states, which could justify elevated access control.
   - The sink code involves getting and removing listener records from `mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords`, indicating management of listener callbacks that could impact system behavior or security if not properly controlled.

3. **Access Control Considerations:**
   - `SYS_OR_SIG` (System or Signature) level access control is typically applied to APIs that could pose a risk to the system's integrity, user data privacy, or require privileges that are only granted to system applications or those signed with the platform key.
   - Given the method's interaction with user states and listener management, which could potentially be exploited to gain unauthorized access or disrupt system services, assigning a lower access control level like `NONE` might not be appropriate.

**Conclusion:**

Given the similarity in functionality with other APIs that are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control (like `removePrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener`), and considering the method's potential impact on system security and user data privacy through its operations on user states and listener records, it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `removePrintServicesChangeListener` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision reflects the need to protect sensitive system operations and user data from unauthorized or malicious access, ensuring the integrity and security of the Android system.
