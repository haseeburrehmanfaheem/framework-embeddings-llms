To determine the access control level for the `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve checking user states and potentially adding a listener to receive print service recommendations. The key operations include creating a new `UserState`, putting it into `mUserStates`, and adding a listener record.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets highlight specific operations related to user state management and listener addition. These are crucial for understanding the method's impact on system resources and user data.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs, `getPrintServiceRecommendations(I)Ljava/util/List;`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to print service recommendations, including potentially sensitive user data and system configurations, are considered significant enough to require either system or signature-level permissions.

Given this analysis, the decision for assigning an access control level to `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` hinges on understanding the sensitivity and potential impact of adding a listener for print service recommendations:

- **Sensitivity**: The operation involves user data (in the form of user states) and system resources (print services). This implies that unauthorized access or manipulation could compromise user privacy or disrupt system functionality.
  
- **Potential Impact**: Adding a listener could allow an app to receive sensitive information about available print services, which might include details about network configurations or device capabilities. This could be used for targeted attacks or to gather intelligence on the device's environment.

Considering these factors and the access control levels of similar APIs (`SYS_OR_SIG`), it is reasonable to conclude that `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` should also have a stringent access control level to protect user data and maintain system integrity.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the need to restrict access to this method, ensuring that only authorized (system or signature-level permission holding) entities can add listeners for print service recommendations, thereby safeguarding user and system interests.
