To assign an access control level to the `restartPrintJob` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs. 

The `restartPrintJob` method interacts with several sinks, including:
- `this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1)`: checks if a user is unlocking or unlocked
- `this.mUserStates.get(p1)` and `this.mUserStates.put(p1, v10)`: gets and puts user states
- `PrintJobInfo v17 = this.mPrintJobForAppCache.getPrintJob(p1, p2)` and `PrintJobInfo v18 = this.mSpooler.getPrintJobInfo(p1, p2)`: gets print job information
- `IPrintSpooler v25 = RemotePrintSpooler.getRemoteInstanceLazy()` and `boolean v26 = this.mSetPrintJobStatusCaller.setPrintJobState(v25, p1, 2, 0)`: sets the print job state

The similar APIs provided are:
- `getPrintJobInfos(II)Ljava/util/List;` with an access control level of `NONE`
- `isPrintServiceEnabled(Landroid/content/ComponentName;I)Z` with an access control level of `NONE`

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not pose a significant security risk. 

However, the `restartPrintJob` method appears to be more complex and potentially sensitive, as it involves restarting a print job and interacting with user states and print spoolers. Despite this, its interactions are largely similar to those of the provided APIs, which have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

Given the information provided and the similarities between the `restartPrintJob` method and the other APIs, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to `restartPrintJob`. This is because, while the method does interact with potentially sensitive data and operations, its overall structure and functionality align closely with those of the similar APIs that have been classified as `NONE`, but considering the additional complexity and potential impact, `NORMAL` seems a more fitting choice.
