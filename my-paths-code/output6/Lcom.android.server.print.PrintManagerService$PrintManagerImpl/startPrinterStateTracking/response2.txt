To assign an access control level to the `startPrinterStateTracking` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `startPrinterStateTracking` method has two paths with depth 2, but both of them contain similar code snippets that interact with sinks. The sinks are:

1. `Object v8 = this.mUserStates.get(p1);`
2. `UserState v9 = new UserState(this.mContext,p1,this.mLock,p2);`
3. `this.mUserStates.put(p1, v9);`
4. `boolean v7 = this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1);`

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `stopPrinterStateTracking(Landroid/print/PrinterId;I)V` with an access control level of `NONE`.
2. `createPrinterDiscoverySession(Landroid/print/IPrinterDiscoveryObserver;I)V` with an access control level of `NONE`.

Both of these similar APIs have a similarity score close to 1, indicating that they are very similar to the `startPrinterStateTracking` method.

The code snippets in the similar APIs also interact with the same sink: `boolean v7 = this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1);`. This suggests that the access control level for the `startPrinterStateTracking` method should be similar to the ones assigned to the similar APIs.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the access control level for the `startPrinterStateTracking` method should be `NONE`, as it is similar to the other APIs and does not seem to pose any significant security risks.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
