To determine the access control level for the `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - Both similar APIs (`removePrintServicesChangeListener` and `removePrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to managing listeners or change listeners in the context of print services are considered sensitive and require either system-level privileges or signature-level access.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet for `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` involves checking user unlock status (`this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1)`), which implies a level of security or privacy consideration.
   - It also creates a new `UserState` object and updates the `mUserStates` map, indicating management of user-specific states, which could be sensitive.

3. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   - The sink code involves checks for user unlock status and manipulation of user states (`UserState v10 = new UserState(this.mContext, p1, this.mLock, p2);` and `this.mUserStates.put(p1, v10);`), reinforcing the notion that this method deals with sensitive operations related to user management.

Given these considerations:

- The similarity in access control levels between the provided APIs (`SYS_OR_SIG`) suggests a consistent approach to securing similar functionalities within the system.
- The nature of the operation (adding a listener for print job state changes) and its interaction with user states and unlock status implies that it should be protected against unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs, code semantics, and the importance of securing operations related to user states and system services, the `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` method should also have a high level of access control.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }}$
