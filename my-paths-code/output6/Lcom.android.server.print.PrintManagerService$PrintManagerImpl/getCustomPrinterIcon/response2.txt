To determine the access control level for the `getCustomPrinterIcon` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getCustomPrinterIcon` method involves several key operations:
1. It checks if a user is unlocking or unlocked using `this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1)`.
2. It interacts with `UserState` objects, creating a new instance and putting it into `this.mUserStates`.
3. It clears the calling identity with `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` before making a remote call to get a custom printer icon.
4. It retrieves an `IPrintSpooler` instance lazily using `RemotePrintSpooler.getRemoteInstanceLazy()` and calls `getCustomPrinterIcon` on it.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:
- `stopPrinterDiscovery(Landroid/print/IPrinterDiscoveryObserver;I)V` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method also interacts with `UserState` but does not involve remote calls or clearing calling identities in its provided snippet. Its operations seem less sensitive compared to `getCustomPrinterIcon`.
- `restartPrintJob(Landroid/print/PrintJobId;II)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method checks user unlocking status, interacts with `UserState`, and makes remote calls to set print job states, which are more critical operations.

Given these comparisons:
- The `getCustomPrinterIcon` method involves checking user status, creating `UserState` instances, making remote calls, and temporarily clearing the calling identity. These actions suggest a need for careful access control due to their potential impact on system security and functionality.
- However, unlike `restartPrintJob`, which directly manipulates print job states (a potentially more critical operation), `getCustomPrinterIcon` seems to be primarily focused on retrieving information about a printer icon.

Considering the operations involved in `getCustomPrinterIcon` and comparing them with the similar APIs, it appears that this method does not fit into the `NONE` category due to its interactions with system states and remote services. It also doesn't seem to fit perfectly into the `SYS_OR_SIG` category as its operations are not as directly impactful on system states as those in `restartPrintJob`. However, given the choices and considering it involves sensitive operations like clearing calling identity and interacting with remote print spoolers, a moderate level of access control seems appropriate.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
This choice reflects the method's involvement in system-critical operations without reaching the level of sensitivity or direct system state manipulation that would necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` access control levels.
