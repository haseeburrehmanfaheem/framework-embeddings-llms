To determine the access control level for the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink codes involve creating a new `UserState` object and putting it into `mUserStates`, as well as checking if a user is unlocking or unlocked using `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked`. These operations are related to managing user states in the context of printer services.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`startPrinterStateTracking` and `createPrinterDiscoverySession`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - The similarity score is very high (approximately 1.0), indicating that these methods are closely related to `stopPrinterStateTracking` in terms of functionality or internal implementation.
   - The code snippets provided for these similar APIs also involve checking user unlock status using `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked`, which is a common operation with the sink code of `stopPrinterStateTracking`.

3. **Access Control Level Consideration**:
   - Given that both highly similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of the operations (managing printer state tracking and user unlock status), it suggests that these methods do not pose significant risks that would require higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The `NORMAL` access control level typically applies to APIs that need some form of protection but are not as sensitive. However, without explicit evidence of needing protection (e.g., handling sensitive data directly, performing actions that could harm the system or user data), and given the similarity with other `NONE` leveled APIs, it leans towards a less restrictive approach.

**Conclusion**: Given the high similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of the operations involved (which do not seem to pose significant risks or handle sensitive information directly in a way that would necessitate higher protection), the most appropriate access control level for `stopPrinterStateTracking` is also `NONE`.
