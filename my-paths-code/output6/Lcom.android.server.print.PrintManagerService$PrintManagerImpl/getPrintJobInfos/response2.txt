To determine the access control level for the `getPrintJobInfos` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getPrintJobInfos` method seems to be part of a print management system, likely within an Android framework or application. It interacts with user states, print jobs, and remote print spoolers, suggesting it handles sensitive operations related to printing.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **restartPrintJob**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions due to its ability to restart print jobs, which could affect system resources or user data.
   - **isPrintServiceEnabled**: With an access control level of `NONE`, this API suggests that checking if a print service is enabled does not pose significant security risks and can be done without specific permissions.

3. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getPrintJobInfos` method involves operations like checking user unlock states (`this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1)`), managing user states (`this.mUserStates.put(p1, v9)`), and interacting with a remote print spooler (`IPrintSpooler v28 = RemotePrintSpooler.getRemoteInstanceLazy()`). These operations imply access to potentially sensitive information or system resources.
   - The method also involves returning a list of print job infos (`return v14;`), which could contain user data or other sensitive information.

4. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Given the similarity with `restartPrintJob`, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, and considering that `getPrintJobInfos` also interacts with system resources (like the remote print spooler) and potentially sensitive user data, it seems reasonable to assign a similar or slightly less restrictive access control level.
   - However, unlike `restartPrintJob`, `getPrintJobInfos` does not seem to modify system states directly but rather retrieves information. This distinction might suggest a slightly lower risk profile compared to actively restarting print jobs.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for the `getPrintJobInfos` method seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects the method's need to access and possibly manipulate user data or system resources without requiring the highest level of permission typically reserved for operations that directly modify critical system states or sensitive user information.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision balances the need to protect user and system resources with the operational requirements of managing print jobs within an Android environment.
