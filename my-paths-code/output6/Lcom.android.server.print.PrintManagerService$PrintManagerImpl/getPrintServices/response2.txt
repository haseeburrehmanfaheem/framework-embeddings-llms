To determine the access control level for the `getPrintServices` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippet for `getPrintServices` shows that it interacts with user states and print services. The sink code highlights operations such as getting a user state from `mUserStates`, creating a new `UserState`, putting the new state into `mUserStates`, calling another instance's `getPrintServices` method, and returning the list of print services.

Comparing this with similar APIs:

1. **getPrintServiceRecommendations**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves getting a user state, creating a new `UserState`, putting it into `mUserStates`, calling `getPrintServiceRecommendations` on another instance, and returning the result. The similarity score is high (0.9439042210578918), indicating that the operations and logic are closely related to those in `getPrintServices`.

2. **startPrinterStateTracking**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. Its code involves getting a user state and creating/putting a new `UserState` into `mUserStates`, but it does not involve calling another method like `getPrintServices` or returning a list of services. The similarity score (0.9157734513282776) is also high, suggesting operational similarities, but the absence of service retrieval and return suggests a difference in functionality.

Given these comparisons:

- **Similarity with getPrintServiceRecommendations** suggests that `getPrintServices` might require a similar access control level due to their operational similarities, especially in how they handle user states and retrieve/print services. The high similarity score supports the idea that `getPrintServices` could also be sensitive in terms of system or signature-level permissions.

- **Difference from startPrinterStateTracking** in terms of functionality (retrieval and return of print services) implies that `getPrintServices` might require more stringent access control than `NONE`, as it deals with potentially sensitive information regarding available print services.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `getPrintServices` seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`, given its operational similarities with `getPrintServiceRecommendations` and the potential sensitivity of the data it handles (print services).

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
