The provided code paths are identical, and we'll proceed with analyzing them to identify potential sinks.

Upon examination, the following instructions collectively contribute to a sink:

- `UserState v6 = new UserState(this.mContext,p1,this.mLock,p2);` 
  This instruction creates a new object with data flow from the API parameter `p1`, thus following one of the positive rules for object creation.
  
- `this.mUserStates.put(p1, v6);`
  This instruction updates a field (`mUserStates`) using the API parameter `p1` and the newly created object `v6`. It follows one of the positive rules by modifying a field with data flow from the API parameters.

- `boolean v11 = v2.getBindInstantServiceAllowed();`
  This method invocation has naming similarity with the API name `getBindInstantServiceAllowed`, thus following one of the positive rules for method invocations.

- `return v11;`
  The return value is directly influenced by the result of `v2.getBindInstantServiceAllowed()`, linking these instructions through data flow and making them part of a coherent sink set.

The identified instructions form a single sink due to their direct influence on each other, with outputs from one instruction being used as inputs or influencing the creation of objects in subsequent instructions. The JSON format for representing this sink is:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserState v6 = new UserState(this.mContext,p1,this.mLock,p2);",
      "this.mUserStates.put(p1, v6);",
      "boolean v11 = v2.getBindInstantServiceAllowed();",
      "return v11;"
    ]
  ]
}
```
