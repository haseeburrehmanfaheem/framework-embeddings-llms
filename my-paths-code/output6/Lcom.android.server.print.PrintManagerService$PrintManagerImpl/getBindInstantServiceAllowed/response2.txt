To determine the access control level for the `getBindInstantServiceAllowed` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet shows that the method interacts with user states and checks if a user is unlocking or unlocked. It also involves creating a new `UserState` object and putting it into `mUserStates`. This interaction suggests some level of sensitivity regarding user management.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code highlights operations related to creating a `UserState` object and retrieving its state, which implies that the method is dealing with sensitive information about users.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setPrintServiceEnabled**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission due to its interaction with user states and enabling/disabling print services.
   - **stopPrinterStateTracking**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that stopping printer state tracking does not require significant permissions, possibly because it's less sensitive than managing user states directly.

Given these points:

- The method `getBindInstantServiceAllowed` is checking a condition related to the binding of instant services for a specific user, which implies some sensitivity regarding user management and service access.
- The similarity with `setPrintServiceEnabled`, which requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access, suggests that operations affecting or querying user states may require higher levels of permission.
- However, the interaction is primarily about checking a condition rather than modifying system settings directly (like enabling/disabling services), which might suggest a slightly lower risk compared to direct modifications.

Considering these factors and comparing with the similar APIs provided:

- The method involves user state management and checks for unlock status, suggesting it's not entirely `NONE` since it deals with potentially sensitive user information.
- It does not seem as directly impactful or risky as `setPrintServiceEnabled`, which suggests a need for system-level access due to its enable/disable nature.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG` because it involves checking user unlock status and managing user states, which are sensitive operations that likely require more than normal permission levels. However, since it's primarily an informational check rather than a modification of system settings or direct action on user data, one might argue for `NORMAL`. Yet, considering the sensitivity and similarity to other system/service management APIs, leaning towards requiring system or signature permissions seems prudent.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This choice reflects the method's involvement in user state management and its need for more than basic permission levels due to the sensitivity of the information it handles, aligning with the access control level assigned to similar system/service management APIs.
