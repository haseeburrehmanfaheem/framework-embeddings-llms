Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `startPrinterDiscovery` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `startPrinterDiscovery` method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them involve creating a new `UserState` object and putting it into the `mUserStates` map. This is similar to the code snippets found in the similar APIs `addPrintServicesChangeListener` and `stopPrinterStateTracking`.

The `addPrintServicesChangeListener` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that it requires a system or signature-level permission to access the `mUserStates` map. The similarity score between this API and `startPrinterDiscovery` is 1.0, indicating a high degree of similarity.

On the other hand, the `stopPrinterStateTracking` API has an access control level of `NONE`, which implies that it does not require any special permissions to access the `mUserStates` map. However, the similarity score between this API and `startPrinterDiscovery` is 0.9918122291564941, which is still relatively high but not as high as the similarity with `addPrintServicesChangeListener`.

Considering the similarities and differences between these APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `startPrinterDiscovery` method. This is because the method involves creating a new `UserState` object and putting it into the `mUserStates` map, which is similar to the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` API that requires system or signature-level permission.

Here is the final access control level for the `startPrinterDiscovery` API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
