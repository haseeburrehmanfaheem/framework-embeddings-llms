To determine the access control level for the `getActiveScorerPackage` method, we should analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs. 

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getActiveScorerPackage` method involves accessing settings related to network recommendations (`"network_recommendations_enabled"` and `"network_recommendations_package"`), retrieving a list of valid scorers using `NetworkScorerAppManager.getAllValidScorers()`, and then potentially returning the recommendation service package name of one of these scorers. This operation does not seem to modify any system settings or perform actions that would be considered dangerous (like accessing sensitive user data without permission, executing commands, etc.). However, it does interact with system settings and components related to network scoring, which could imply a need for certain privileges.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The provided similar APIs (`getActiveScorer()Landroid/net/NetworkScorerAppData;`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are system-internal or require signature-level permission to execute, possibly because they deal with internal system settings and network scorer app data.
   - The similarity in code structure between the `getActiveScorerPackage` method and these APIs (all involving checks on network recommendation settings and interacting with `NetworkScorerAppManager`) implies that `getActiveScorerPackage` might also require a similar level of access control.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Implies no special permissions are required, which seems unlikely given the method's interaction with system settings.
   - `NORMAL`: Suggests the method requires standard Android permissions that most apps can request without needing to be signed with the platform key or having a specific signature. However, given the method's dealings with potentially sensitive network scorer information and system settings, this might not be sufficient.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Indicates the operation could pose a risk to the user (e.g., accessing their location, contacts). While the method does access system settings, it doesn't seem to pose an immediate danger or directly handle sensitive user data.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Implies the need for either system-level access or signature-level permissions. Given the similarities with other APIs labeled as such and the nature of its operations (accessing internal network scorer configurations), this seems like the most appropriate category.

**Conclusion**: Based on the method's functionality, its interaction with system settings, and its similarity to other APIs that are classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getActiveScorerPackage` method should also be categorized under the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This reflects the method's need for either system-level privileges or specific signature permissions due to its involvement with internal network scorer configurations.
