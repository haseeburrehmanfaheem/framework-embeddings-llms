To assign an access control level to the `requestScores` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `requestScores` method is interacting with the `INetworkRecommendationProvider` interface, which suggests that it's related to network recommendations. The method takes a `NetworkKey` object as an argument and calls the `requestScores` method on the `INetworkRecommendationProvider` instance.

Looking at the provided similar API, `setActiveScorer`, we can see that it has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the API is sensitive and requires either system or signature-level permission to access.

Comparing the code of `requestScores` with `setActiveScorer`, we can notice some similarities:

1. Both methods interact with network-related functionality.
2. Both methods have a similar structure, with a check for a specific condition (`this.mServiceConnection == 0` in `requestScores` and `this.mSettingsFacade.getString` in `setActiveScorer`) before performing the main action.

However, there are also some differences:

1. The `requestScores` method calls another method on an interface (`INetworkRecommendationProvider`), whereas `setActiveScorer` modifies a setting using the `mSettingsFacade`.
2. The `requestScores` method does not seem to modify any system settings or have a significant impact on the system's behavior, unlike `setActiveScorer`.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the `requestScores` method is likely less sensitive than `setActiveScorer`. However, since it still interacts with network-related functionality and calls an interface method, it may require some level of access control.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `requestScores` method. This level indicates that the method requires some permission or authentication but is not as sensitive as methods that modify system settings or have a significant impact on the system's behavior.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
