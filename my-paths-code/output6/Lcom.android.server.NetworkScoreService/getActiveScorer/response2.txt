To determine the access control level for the `getActiveScorer` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sinks, and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**: The provided code snippets show two paths (path 1 and path 2) within the `getActiveScorer` method. Both paths involve retrieving settings related to network recommendations and checking if a specific scorer package is enabled and valid. If conditions are met, it returns an instance of `NetworkScorerAppData`.

2. **Sinks Analysis**: The sinks mentioned involve interactions with system settings (`mSettingsFacade.getInt` and `mSettingsFacade.getString`) and querying for valid scorers (`NetworkScorerAppManager.getAllValidScorers`). These operations suggest access to potentially sensitive system configuration data.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `getActiveScorerPackage()Ljava/lang/String;`, with high similarity scores (0.9849647283554077 and 0.9834045171737671) and an assigned access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These similar APIs also interact with system settings to retrieve the package name of the active scorer, indicating they deal with system-level configuration data.

Given this information:
- The `getActiveScorer` method interacts with system settings and retrieves sensitive system configuration data, similar to the provided APIs.
- The similarity in code paths and sinks between `getActiveScorer` and the provided `getActiveScorerPackage()` APIs suggests they operate within a similar security context.
- The access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` for the similar APIs implies that these operations are either signature or system protected, reflecting their need to access system-level data securely.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of code paths, sinks, and the comparison with similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getActiveScorer` method should have a similar access control level. The method's interaction with system settings and its operational similarity to other `SYS_OR_SIG` protected methods justify assigning it an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
