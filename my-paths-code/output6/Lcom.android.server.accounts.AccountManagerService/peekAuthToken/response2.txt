To determine the access control level for the `peekAuthToken` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `peekAuthToken` method is used to retrieve an authentication token for a given account. It checks if the account and auth token type are valid, and then queries the database to retrieve the token. If the token is not found in the cache, it queries the database directly.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `getUserData`: This method retrieves user data for a given account. It also queries the database, but it does so using a different table (`ceDb.extras` instead of `ceDb.authtokens`). The access control level for this method is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `getPreviousName`: This method retrieves the previous name for a given account. It uses a cache to store previous names and queries the database if the name is not found in the cache. The access control level for this method is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive data.

The `peekAuthToken` method also accesses sensitive data (authentication tokens) and uses a similar approach to query the database. Therefore, it is likely that this method requires a similar level of access control.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `peekAuthToken` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This is because the method accesses sensitive data and requires system or signature-level permission to do so, similar to the provided similar APIs.
