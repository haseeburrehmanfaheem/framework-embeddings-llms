To determine the access control level for the `getPreviousName` API, let's analyze its interactions with sensitive data or operations and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Interaction with Sensitive Data**: The `getPreviousName` method interacts with the account database by querying it for previous names associated with a given account (`SQLiteDatabase v23 = this.mDeDatabase.getReadableDatabase();`). This operation involves accessing potentially sensitive user data, suggesting that some level of access control might be necessary.

2. **Use of Binder and UserHandle**: The API uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the caller's UID and `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` to get the calling user ID. These operations are indicative of APIs that need to enforce permissions or access controls based on the identity of the caller, which is a common requirement for system or signature-protected APIs.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The `registerAccountListener` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and it involves getting the calling user ID (`UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`), similar to `getPreviousName`. This suggests that operations related to account management are subject to system or signature-level protection.
   - The `removeAccountAsUser` API also has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. It checks the caller's UID (`Binder.getCallingUid()`) and involves user-specific operations, indicating that such actions require restricted access.

Given these points, the `getPreviousName` method appears to handle sensitive data (previous account names) and performs operations similar to those found in system or signature-protected APIs (e.g., accessing database information based on caller identity). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this API should have a similar level of access control to protect user data and ensure the security of account management operations.

The final access control level for the `getPreviousName` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the need to restrict access to this method, ensuring that only system-privileged or signature-verified applications can retrieve previous names associated with accounts, thereby protecting user privacy and maintaining the integrity of account management functions.
