Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getUserData` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `getUserData` method interacts with the `userDataCache` and `mDeDatabase`, which are also used in the similar APIs `getPassword` and `renameAccount`. These APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive data.

The `getUserData` method also uses the `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` methods, which are used to retrieve the calling user's ID and UID. This suggests that the method is checking the caller's identity and privileges before accessing the user data.

The sink code provided shows that the method is accessing sensitive data from the `userDataCache` and `mDeDatabase`, which is similar to the behavior of the `getPassword` and `renameAccount` APIs.

Considering these factors, I conclude that the `getUserData` method requires system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive user data. Therefore, the access control level for this API should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
