Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `invalidateAuthToken` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `invalidateAuthToken` method interacts with the database by writing and reading data from it. It uses the `SQLiteDatabase` class to perform transactions and queries on the database. The method also evicts tokens from the token cache.

The similar APIs, `clearPassword(Landroid/accounts/Account;)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the database by writing and reading data from it. They use the `SQLiteDatabase` class to perform transactions and queries on the database.

Considering the similarity in the code snippets and the interactions with the database, I would assign the same access control level to the `invalidateAuthToken` method as its similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `invalidateAuthToken` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the `invalidateAuthToken` method interacts with sensitive data in the database and performs operations that require a certain level of privilege, similar to its similar APIs. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level indicates that the method can be called by system or signature applications, which have the necessary privileges to perform these operations.
