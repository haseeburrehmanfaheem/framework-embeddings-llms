Based on the provided information, I will analyze the given API and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `getAccountsByFeatures` method has three paths with depth 2, and it interacts with the sink code, which includes:

1. Creating a new `AccountManagerService$GetAccountsByTypeAndFeatureSession` object.
2. Getting service info from `IAccountAuthenticatorCache`.
3. Calling `onResult` on the `IAccountManagerResponse` object.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `editProperties` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with `IAccountAuthenticatorCache` and gets service info.
2. `isCredentialsUpdateSuggested` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also creates a new object and interacts with `IAccountAuthenticatorCache`.

Considering the similarity between these APIs and their interactions with sensitive components, I conclude that the `getAccountsByFeatures` method should have a similar access control level.

The final access control level for the `getAccountsByFeatures` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the API requires system or signature-level permission to access sensitive account information and interact with account authenticator services.
