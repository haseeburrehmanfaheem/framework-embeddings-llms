Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` method interacts with system properties and services, specifically:

1. It retrieves system properties using `this.mInjector.systemPropertiesGet`.
2. It creates a `RecoverySystemService$UncryptSocket` object and calls its `connectService` method.
3. In one of the paths, it reboots the device using `PowerManager`.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `clearBcb()Z` with a similarity score of 0.9999999403953552, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with system properties and services.
2. Another instance of `clearBcb()Z` with the same similarity score and access control level, which creates a `RecoverySystemService$UncryptSocket` object and calls its `connectService` method.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all interact with sensitive system components, I conclude that the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` method requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the API can only be accessed by system or signature-protected components, ensuring that only authorized and trusted entities can interact with these sensitive system components.
