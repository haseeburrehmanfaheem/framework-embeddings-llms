To determine the access control level for the `isLskfCaptured` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `isLskfCaptured` method checks if a given string `p1` is contained within `mCallerPreparedForReboot`. This suggests it's verifying some state related to reboot preparation.
   - The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the LSKF ( Likely a reference to Logical Scoped Keyed Factory, but in this context possibly related to boot or security mechanisms) is captured.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **clearLskf**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It not only checks for the presence of a string in `mCallerPreparedForReboot` but also performs removal operations from `mCallerPendingRequest` and `mCallerPreparedForReboot`, and then calls `clearRebootEscrow` on a `LockSettingsInternal` object. Despite its more invasive actions, it has a lower access control requirement.
   - **rebootWithLskf**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves checking if LSKF is captured (similar to our method), verifies a slot for the next boot, and reports reboot escrow metrics. The higher access control level here suggests that actions related to rebooting with specific parameters are more sensitive.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `isLskfCaptured` only checks the state without modifying it or performing any action that directly affects system security or privacy, its required access control level should be lower than `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Considering `clearLskf` has an access control level of `NONE` and performs more significant operations (including removals and clearing escrow), but `isLskfCaptured` only reads a state without any modification or sensitive data exposure, it suggests that `isLskfCaptured` should not require higher access control than `clearLskf`.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's functionality is limited to checking a state without modifying system settings, sensitive data, or performing critical operations like rebooting, and comparing with similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `isLskfCaptured` would be `NONE`. This reflects its minimal impact on system security and privacy.
