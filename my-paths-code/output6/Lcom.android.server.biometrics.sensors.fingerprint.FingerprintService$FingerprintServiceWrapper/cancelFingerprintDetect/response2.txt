To determine the access control level for the `cancelFingerprintDetect` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels. The given similar APIs, `cancelEnrollment` and `detectFingerprint`, both have an access control level of `NORMAL`. 

Looking at the provided code snippets for `cancelFingerprintDetect`, we see interactions with fingerprint sensor properties and service providers, which is similar to what's observed in the `cancelEnrollment` and `detectFingerprint` APIs. The critical aspect here is how these APIs interact with system resources and user data.

1. **Interaction with System Resources**: All three APIs (`cancelFingerprintDetect`, `cancelEnrollment`, and `detectFingerprint`) interact with fingerprint sensor properties, which involves accessing hardware capabilities of the device. This interaction does not inherently suggest a high-risk operation that would require elevated permissions like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **User Data and Privacy**: The operations performed by these APIs (cancelling fingerprint detection, enrollment, or detecting fingerprints) do involve user-specific data but are primarily focused on managing the authentication process rather than accessing sensitive information directly.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs (`cancelEnrollment` and `detectFingerprint`) have been assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. Their code snippets show operations that are comparable to what's seen in `cancelFingerprintDetect`, such as getting sensor properties, iterating through service providers, and performing actions based on the fingerprint sensor state.

Given these observations:

- The operation of cancelling fingerprint detection is not inherently dangerous or system-significant enough to warrant a `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
- It does involve interaction with device hardware (fingerprint sensors) but in a manner consistent with managing authentication processes, which aligns more closely with a `NORMAL` access control level.
- The similarity in code structure and functionality with other APIs that have a `NORMAL` access control level further supports this conclusion.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code paths and comparison with similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `cancelFingerprintDetect` API is `NORMAL`.
