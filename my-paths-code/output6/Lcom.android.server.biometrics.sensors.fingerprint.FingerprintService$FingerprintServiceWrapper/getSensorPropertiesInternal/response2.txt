To determine the access control level for the `getSensorPropertiesInternal` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `getSensorPropertiesInternal` returns a list of sensor properties (`this.mSensorProps`). This operation does not inherently suggest any dangerous or system-level modifications. It seems to be more about retrieving existing information rather than modifying it.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The provided similar API, `remove(Landroid/os/IBinder;IILandroid/hardware/face/IFaceServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;)V`, has an access control level of `NORMAL`. This method involves more complex operations like scheduling a removal based on sensor properties obtained from `FaceService.getSensorProperties()`. Despite its complexity and the fact that it deals with face service receivers and potentially sensitive operations, its access control level is `NORMAL`.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not pose any security risks.
   - `NORMAL`: For most methods that do not deal with sensitive information or system-level critical operations but still require some form of authentication or authorization.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can cause harm if misused, such as those dealing with personal data, payments, etc.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: System or signature level permissions which are usually for methods affecting system settings or requiring high-level access.

Given the above analysis:
- The method `getSensorPropertiesInternal` does not seem to perform any operations that would be classified as `DANGEROUS` (e.g., dealing with sensitive user data, financial transactions) or require `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions (e.g., system settings modifications).
- It's more aligned with retrieving information (`this.mSensorProps`), which doesn't inherently pose a significant risk.
- Considering the similar API has an access control level of `NORMAL` and this method is less complex and risky, it suggests that `getSensorPropertiesInternal` should likely have a lower or similar access control requirement.

However, without explicit context about what `this.mSensorProps` contains (e.g., if it's sensitive information), we must consider the general principle of least privilege. Given its nature as an internal method retrieving properties and not performing any system-level modifications or accessing highly sensitive data, it seems reasonable to assign a moderate access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and considering the principle of least privilege, the final access control level for `getSensorPropertiesInternal` would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment reflects its operational similarity to the provided API example and acknowledges that while it might not require high-level system permissions or pose a significant danger, it still involves accessing internal properties which could have some level of sensitivity or importance.
