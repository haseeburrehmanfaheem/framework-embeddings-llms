To assign an access control level to the `removeAll` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeAll` method creates a new instance of `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper$2` and iterates over a list of service providers. The sink code suggests that this method is related to fingerprint authentication.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `removeAll(Landroid/os/IBinder;ILandroid/hardware/face/IFaceServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;)V` has an access control level of `NORMAL`. This API also creates a new instance of a wrapper class (`FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper$1`) and is related to face authentication. The similarity score of 0.7906144857406616 indicates a high degree of similarity between the two APIs.

2. `registerAuthenticators(Ljava/util/List;)V` has an access control level of `NORMAL`. This API creates a new instance of a lambda class (`FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`) and is related to fingerprint authentication. Although the similarity score (0.7050910592079163) is slightly lower than the first similar API, it still indicates a significant degree of similarity.

Given the similarities between these APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `removeAll` method should have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This is because all three methods are related to authentication (fingerprint or face), create new instances of wrapper classes, and have similar code structures.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
