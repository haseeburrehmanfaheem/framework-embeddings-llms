To assign an access control level to the `getSensorProperties` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippet for `getSensorProperties` has three paths, but all of them seem to be related to retrieving sensor properties from a service provider. The sink code indicates that the method interacts with the `containsSensor` and `getSensorProperties` methods of the `ServiceProvider` class.

Comparing this API with similar ones:

1. `getSensorProperties(ILjava/lang/String;)Landroid/hardware/face/FaceSensorPropertiesInternal;` has a similarity score of 0.8615967631340027 and an access control level of NORMAL. This API is very similar to the one in question, as it also retrieves sensor properties from a service provider.
2. `isHardwareDetected(ILjava/lang/String;)Z` has a similarity score of 0.7849725484848022 and an access control level of NORMAL. Although this API has a slightly lower similarity score, it still interacts with the `containsSensor` method and retrieves information from a service provider.

Based on these similarities and the fact that the `getSensorProperties` API does not seem to perform any sensitive or dangerous operations, we can conclude that its access control level should be NORMAL.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
