To determine the access control level for the `isHardwareDetectedDeprecated` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

All three paths of the `isHardwareDetectedDeprecated` method involve checks that are related to security and privacy, such as checking if the app is in the foreground (`Utils.isForeground(p5, p6)`), if it's the current user or profile (`Utils.isCurrentUserOrProfile(v13, p7)`), and performing an AppOps check (`FingerprintService.checkAppOps(p5, p2, p3)`). These checks are indicative of a method that handles sensitive information or functionality.

The sink code provided involves accessing sensor properties and detecting hardware, which is a sensitive operation related to fingerprint recognition. This suggests that the method could potentially be used to gather information about the device's hardware capabilities without proper authorization.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `detectFingerprint`: This API has an access control level of NORMAL. It involves detecting fingerprints, which is a security-sensitive operation. The code snippet provided shows it interacting with sensor properties and service providers in a manner similar to `isHardwareDetectedDeprecated`.

2. `cancelFingerprintDetect`: Also has an access control level of NORMAL. It's involved in canceling fingerprint detection operations, which implies handling or manipulating ongoing security processes.

Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that both comparable APIs have an access control level of NORMAL, it suggests that `isHardwareDetectedDeprecated` should also be classified under a similar or potentially higher access control level due to its interaction with sensitive device hardware (fingerprint sensors) and user data.

However, since `isHardwareDetectedDeprecated` seems to primarily focus on detecting if the hardware is present and does not directly involve operations like enrolling or verifying fingerprints (which would require more stringent security measures), assigning it a NORMAL access control level aligns with the provided comparisons.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
