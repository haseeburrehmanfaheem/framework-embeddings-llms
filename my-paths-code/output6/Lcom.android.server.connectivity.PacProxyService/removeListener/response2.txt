To determine the access control level for the `removeListener` method, we should consider the similarities it shares with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs, `unregisterListener` and `unregisterCallback`, both have an access control level of `NONE`. 

The key factors to consider here are:
1. **Code Similarity**: The code snippets for all mentioned methods (`removeListener`, `unregisterListener`, and `unregisterCallback`) show a very similar structure, with the primary action being the unregistration of a callback/listener through `this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1)`. This suggests that these methods serve a comparable purpose in terms of managing event listeners or callbacks.
2. **Semantic Meaning**: The semantic meaning of removing or unregistering a listener/callback implies that these operations are related to event handling mechanisms within an application or system. Typically, such actions do not directly involve sensitive user data or critical system resources that would necessitate higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they are considered safe and do not pose significant risks regarding data privacy or system integrity.

Given these considerations, it's reasonable to infer that the `removeListener` method, with its similar functionality and purpose, would also not require stringent access controls. Therefore, based on the information provided and the comparisons made, the access control level for the `removeListener` API should be consistent with those of its similar counterparts.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
