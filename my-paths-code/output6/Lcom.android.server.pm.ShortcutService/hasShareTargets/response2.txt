Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `hasShareTargets` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `hasShareTargets` method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them involve checking if a user is unlocked or not, loading a shortcut user, and then checking if a package has share targets. The sink code snippets also show that the method is interacting with `ShortcutService` and `ShortcutPackage` classes.

The similar APIs provided are `onApplicationActive` methods with similarity scores of 0.8990879058837891 and 0.8966668844223022, both with an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with the same classes (`ShortcutService` and `ShortcutPackage`) and have similar code patterns.

Given the similarities between the `hasShareTargets` method and the provided APIs, it appears that this method is not performing any sensitive operations that would require a higher access control level. The interactions with `ShortcutService` and `ShortcutPackage` classes seem to be related to managing shortcuts and packages, which does not necessarily involve sensitive user data or actions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and similar APIs, I conclude that the `hasShareTargets` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
