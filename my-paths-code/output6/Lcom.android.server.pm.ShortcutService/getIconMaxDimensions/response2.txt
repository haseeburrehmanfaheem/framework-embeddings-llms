To determine the access control level for the `getIconMaxDimensions` API, we need to consider its interactions with sensitive operations and data, as well as compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Interactions with Sensitive Operations**: The `getIconMaxDimensions` API interacts with several potentially sensitive operations:
   - It checks the package UID using `this.mIPackageManager.getPackageUid(p1, 795136, p2)`, which involves verifying the identity of the calling package.
   - It uses `ShortcutService.injectClearCallingIdentity()` and `ShortcutService.injectRestoreCallingIdentity(v7)` to manage the calling identity temporarily. This is typically done to perform operations that should not be attributed to the current caller for security or privacy reasons.
   - It retrieves application information using `ShortcutService.getApplicationInfo(p1, p2)`, which could potentially expose sensitive details about installed applications.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**: The provided similar APIs (`getShortcuts`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the package manager to get the UID of a package and manage calling identities temporarily, similar to `getIconMaxDimensions`. They are involved in retrieving shortcuts for a specific user and package, which is a sensitive operation requiring proper authorization.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**: Given that `getIconMaxDimensions` performs checks on the calling package's identity, manages calling identities, and retrieves application information, these operations suggest that it deals with potentially sensitive data or capabilities. However, unlike the similar APIs that retrieve specific shortcuts (which could be considered more sensitive as they deal with user-specific data), `getIconMaxDimensions` seems to return a dimension value (`this.mMaxIconDimension`) which is not inherently sensitive.

Considering these points:
- The operations performed by `getIconMaxDimensions` involve managing identities and checking package permissions, which indicates some level of security consideration.
- The similar APIs (`getShortcuts`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their handling of user-specific shortcuts, but `getIconMaxDimensions` does not deal with such sensitive, user-specific data directly.

Given the information provided and focusing on the nature of operations (identity management, package checks) without direct access to sensitive user data like specific shortcuts, **the most appropriate access control level for `getIconMaxDimensions` would be `NORMAL`**. This choice reflects that while it performs security-related checks, its primary function does not expose highly sensitive information or require the highest levels of system or signature permissions.
