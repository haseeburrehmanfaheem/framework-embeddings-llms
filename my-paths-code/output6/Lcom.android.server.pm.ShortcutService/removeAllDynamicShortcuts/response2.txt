To determine the access control level for the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `getShortcuts`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9260923266410828 with `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `removeLongLivedShortcuts`: With a similarity score of 0.8963974714279175, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippets provided for `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` show interactions with package managers, user management, and shortcut services. These operations are sensitive as they involve managing shortcuts which can be considered part of a device's configuration or user data.
   - The presence of `injectClearCallingIdentity()` and `injectRestoreCallingIdentity(v7)` suggests that the method is working with system-level identities, which is a strong indicator of requiring higher access control levels to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.
   - The use of `ShortcutService.getApplicationInfo(p1, p2)` and checks like `ShortcutService.isEphemeralApp(v11)` indicate interactions with application information and specific app types (ephemeral apps), further suggesting the need for controlled access.

3. **Access Control Level Considerations:**
   - `NONE`: This level suggests no restrictions or very basic access control, which does not align with the sensitive nature of shortcut management.
   - `NORMAL`: While this is a common default, the method's interaction with system identities and potential to impact user data or device configuration suggests it might require more stringent control.
   - `DANGEROUS`: This level indicates that the API can pose a significant risk if misused. Given the method's ability to remove dynamic shortcuts, which could potentially disrupt user experience or be used maliciously, this seems like a plausible choice.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Both similar APIs have this access control level, indicating they require either system-level privileges or signature-level access (i.e., the calling app must be signed with the same certificate as the app that owns the API). This aligns with the observed system interactions and sensitivity of shortcut management.

Considering these points, especially the similarity in functionality and access control levels of related APIs (`getShortcuts` and `removeLongLivedShortcuts`), and the nature of operations performed by `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a restrictive access control level to protect user data and device integrity.

**Conclusion:**

Given the analysis, the most appropriate access control level for `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` is `SYS_OR_SIG`, reflecting its need for system or signature-level access due to its interactions with sensitive device and user data.
