Based on the provided information, I will analyze the access control level of the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method.

The method has three paths with similar code and interacts with the same sinks as the provided similar APIs. The sinks include:

* `getPackageUid`
* `getApplicationInfo`
* `ShortcutUser` construction
* `put` operation on `mUsers`
* `ShortcutPackage` construction

The similar APIs, `disableShortcuts` and `getRemainingCallCount`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. They also interact with the same sinks as the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method.

Considering the similarity in code and sinks between the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method and the similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level of the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method should be the same as the similar APIs.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
