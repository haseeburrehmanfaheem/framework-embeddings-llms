Based on the provided information, I will analyze the code and assign an access control level to the `reportShortcutUsed` API.

The `reportShortcutUsed` API has three paths with similar code structures, interacting with the same sinks, such as `getPackageUid`, `getApplicationInfo`, `isEphemeralApp`, and `reportShortcutUsage`. The API also has similar code patterns, like checking for ephemeral apps and handling user unlocking or locking states.

The provided similar APIs, `disableShortcuts` and `pushDynamicShortcut`, have a high similarity score with the `reportShortcutUsed` API. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Considering the similarities in code structure, sinks, and similar APIs, I conclude that the `reportShortcutUsed` API should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the API interacts with sensitive system components, such as package managers and user managers, and requires privileged access to perform its functions.

Here is the final access control level for the `reportShortcutUsed` API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
