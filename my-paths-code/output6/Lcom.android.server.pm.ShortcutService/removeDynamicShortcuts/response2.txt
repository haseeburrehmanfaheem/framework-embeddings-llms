To determine the access control level for the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeDynamicShortcuts` method interacts with sensitive data, such as package UIDs, application information, and shortcut packages. It also performs operations like removing shortcuts, checking package changes, and updating user data.

The sink code snippets show that this method accesses and modifies sensitive data, including:

1. Package UIDs and application information (`int v8 = this.mIPackageManager.getPackageUid(p1, 795136, p2);` and `ApplicationInfo v12 = ShortcutService.getApplicationInfo(p1, p2);`)
2. Shortcut packages and user data (`ShortcutUser v25 = new ShortcutUser(ShortcutService,p2);`, `this.mUsers.put(p2, );`, and `ShortcutPackage v31 = new ShortcutPackage(ShortcutUser,this.mUserId,p1);`)

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access and modify sensitive data.

Based on the code analysis and comparison with similar APIs, I conclude that the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method also requires system or signature-level permissions to perform its operations.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
