Based on the provided code snippets and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `disableShortcuts` method.

The `disableShortcuts` method interacts with sensitive data, such as package UIDs, application information, and shortcut packages. It also performs operations that require elevated permissions, like checking if a user is unlocked or if an app is ephemeral.

The similar APIs, `removeLongLivedShortcuts` and `pushDynamicShortcut`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs also interact with similar sensitive data and perform similar operations.

Given the similarities between the `disableShortcuts` method and the similar APIs, I conclude that the `disableShortcuts` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that the `disableShortcuts` method can only be executed by system-level or signature-level privileged code, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.
