To determine the access control level for the `importTextMessage` method, we need to consider its similarity with other APIs, particularly the one provided, `addTextMessageDraft`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The similarity score between `importTextMessage` and `addTextMessageDraft` is 0.8296193480491638, indicating a high degree of similarity in their functionality or parameters.

Both methods involve operations related to text messages:
- `addTextMessageDraft` is used for adding a draft of a text message.
- `importTextMessage` seems to be involved in importing a text message, possibly into the messaging system of an Android device.

Given that `addTextMessageDraft` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that operations related to modifying or accessing message drafts require either system-level permissions (`SYS`) or signature-level permissions (`SIG`), likely due to privacy and security concerns.

Considering the similarity in functionality between these two APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `importTextMessage` would also require a similar level of access control. This is because importing text messages could potentially involve accessing sensitive user data or modifying message stores on the device, which should be restricted to system-level components or applications signed with the platform key.

Therefore, based on the similarity with `addTextMessageDraft` and considering the potential security implications of importing text messages, the access control level for `importTextMessage` should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
