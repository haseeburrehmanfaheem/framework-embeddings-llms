To determine the access control level for the `addTextMessageDraft` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `addTextMessageDraft` method has two paths, both of which involve calling the `addTextMessageDraft` method on an `IMms` object. The main difference between the two paths is how the `IMms` object is obtained: either from `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` or from `this.mServiceStubForFailure`.

The sink code for this method is a simple call to `addTextMessageDraft` on an `IMms` object, which returns a `Uri` object.

Now, let's compare this with the similar APIs:

1. `importTextMessage`: This API has a similarity score of 0.83 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code is similar to the sink code of `addTextMessageDraft`, as it also calls a method on an `IMms` object and returns a `Uri` object.
2. `addMultimediaMessageDraft`: This API has a similarity score of 0.76 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code is also similar to the sink code of `addTextMessageDraft`, as it calls a method on an `IMms` object and returns a `Uri` object.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the `IMms` service. Given the similarities between these APIs and the `addTextMessageDraft` method, it is likely that `addTextMessageDraft` also requires a system or signature-level permission.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `addTextMessageDraft` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
