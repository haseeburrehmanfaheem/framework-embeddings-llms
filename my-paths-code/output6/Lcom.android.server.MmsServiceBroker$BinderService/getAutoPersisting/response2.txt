To determine the access control level for the `getAutoPersisting` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve getting a service using `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` and then calling `getAutoPersisting()` on the obtained service. This indicates interaction with a system service.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet involves getting the MMS service and calling `getAutoPersisting()`, similar to the method's paths. This further emphasizes the interaction with system-level services.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **sendStoredMessage**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with the MMS service for sending stored messages, which can be considered a sensitive operation affecting system or user data.
   - **deleteStoredMessage**: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves deleting stored messages via the MMS service, another operation that impacts user or system data.

Given these points:

- The method `getAutoPersisting` interacts with system services similar to the provided similar APIs (`sendStoredMessage` and `deleteStoredMessage`).
- These similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system-level permissions or signature-level permissions to execute, due to their potential impact on user or system data.
- The operation `getAutoPersisting` might seem less intrusive than sending or deleting messages, but it still involves interacting with a system service and potentially accessing or modifying settings related to MMS auto-persisting behavior.

Considering the above analysis, even though `getAutoPersisting` seems like a read operation (which typically might be considered less risky), its interaction with system services and potential implications on system or user data handling suggest that it should be treated with a similar level of caution as the provided similar APIs. Therefore, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `getAutoPersisting` seems reasonable, ensuring that only authorized components (either system-level or those signed with the appropriate certificate) can access this functionality.

**Access Control Level Decision**:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
