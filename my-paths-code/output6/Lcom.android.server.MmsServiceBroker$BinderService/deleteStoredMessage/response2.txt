To determine the access control level for the `deleteStoredMessage` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `deleteStoredMessage` API has two paths with depth 2, both of which interact with the `MmsServiceBroker` to get or connect to an `IMms` service. This service is then used to call the `deleteStoredMessage` method on the `IMms` instance. The sink code also shows a similar pattern of getting the `IMms` service and calling the `deleteStoredMessage` method.

The two similar APIs provided, `deleteStoredConversation` and `sendStoredMessage`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `MmsServiceBroker` to get or connect to an `IMms` service and then call a method on the `IMms` instance.

Given the similarities between the `deleteStoredMessage` API and the provided similar APIs, it is likely that the `deleteStoredMessage` API should have the same access control level as the similar APIs. The fact that all these APIs interact with the `MmsServiceBroker` and an `IMms` service suggests that they are related to sensitive operations (e.g., deleting or sending messages) that require a certain level of permission or access control.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `deleteStoredMessage` API should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
