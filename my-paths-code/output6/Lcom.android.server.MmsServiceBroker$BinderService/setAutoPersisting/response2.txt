To determine the access control level for the `setAutoPersisting` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar API, `startProtoDump`. 

The `setAutoPersisting` method appears to interact with a service (`IMms`) through a broker (`MmsServiceBroker`), setting an auto-persisting property based on input parameters. The method's primary operation involves calling `setAutoPersisting` on the service object obtained from the broker or using a stub in case of failure.

Given that the similar API, `startProtoDump`, has an access control level of `NONE`, we should consider what this implies about its interaction with sensitive resources or operations. However, the `startProtoDump` method seems to involve writing data (possibly for debugging purposes), which might not directly relate to the persistence setting operation in `setAutoPersisting`.

Despite the differences in their operations, both methods seem to interact with underlying services or system components without explicit checks for permissions or sensitive operations that would typically require elevated access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The key factors influencing the access control level are:
- The nature of the operation: Setting auto-persisting is more about configuration than accessing sensitive data.
- Interaction with system services: While it interacts with a service, it does so through a broker and doesn't directly imply a need for dangerous or signature-level permissions.

Given these considerations, unless there's an explicit requirement for protecting the operation of setting auto-persistence (which isn't indicated by the provided context), the method would likely not require a high level of access control. 

Therefore, considering the similarities with other APIs and the nature of its operation, the `setAutoPersisting` method could be assigned an access control level that reflects its relatively non-sensitive nature.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice leans towards caution while acknowledging the method's interaction with system services without explicit evidence of sensitive data handling or operations requiring higher protection levels.
