To determine the access control level for the `getEditingSessionId` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `getEditingSessionId` method generates a random byte array using `SecureRandom`, encodes it as a Base64 string, and then uses this string in some metrics-related operations before returning it. The key aspects to consider for access control are:

1. **Data Generation and Usage**: The method generates a random ID, which is then used in metrics operations. This does not inherently suggest a need for elevated permissions since the data generated is random and used internally.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - `getTranscodingSessionId` and `getBundleSessionId` have been provided as similar APIs, both with an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also generate random IDs using `SecureRandom` and Base64 encoding, similar to `getEditingSessionId`.
   - The primary difference between these APIs and `getEditingSessionId` lies in the additional metrics-related operations within `getEditingSessionId`. However, these operations do not seem to require specific permissions or access controls beyond what's typical for internal logging or metrics purposes.

Given this analysis, the `getEditingSessionId` method does not appear to perform any actions that would necessitate a higher level of access control than `NONE`, especially considering its similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`. The generation and use of a random ID for metrics purposes do not inherently require special permissions.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getEditingSessionId` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
