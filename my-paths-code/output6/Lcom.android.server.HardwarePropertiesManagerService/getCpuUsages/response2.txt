To assign an access control level to the `getCpuUsages` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getCpuUsages` method takes a string parameter `p1` and returns `CpuUsageInfo`. It checks if the calling app is a device owner app using `DevicePolicyManager`. If it is, the method calls `HardwarePropertiesManagerService.nativeGetCpuUsages()` to retrieve CPU usage information.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet indicates that the method retrieves CPU usage information through a native call (`HardwarePropertiesManagerService.nativeGetCpuUsages()`), which suggests interaction with system-level or hardware properties.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `getDeviceTemperatures` and `getFanSpeeds` have similarity scores indicating they share significant characteristics with `getCpuUsages`. Both of these methods also interact with system-level or hardware properties (`nativeGetDeviceTemperatures` and `nativeGetFanSpeeds`, respectively).
   - Both similar APIs are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically denotes that the API can be accessed by system or signature applications, suggesting a higher level of privilege due to their interaction with sensitive device information.

4. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that `getCpuUsages` interacts with system-level properties (retrieving CPU usage) and is conditioned on the caller being a device owner app, it implies a need for a certain level of system access or trust.
   - The similarity in behavior and access control levels between `getCpuUsages`, `getDeviceTemperatures`, and `getFanSpeeds` suggests that `getCpuUsages` should also be restricted to system or signature applications to maintain consistency and security.

Therefore, considering the method's interaction with sensitive device information and its conditional access based on device ownership, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `getCpuUsages`, aligning with the similar APIs provided.
