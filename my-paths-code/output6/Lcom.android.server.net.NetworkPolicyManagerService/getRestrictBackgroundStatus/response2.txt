To determine the access control level for the `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` method takes an integer parameter `p1` and returns a fixed integer value `3`. This method does not seem to interact with any sensitive data or operations that could potentially compromise the system's security or user's privacy.
   - The sink code provided simply assigns the value `3` to `v2` and returns it, which further supports the notion that this method does not handle sensitive information.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **setVpnPackageAuthorization(Ljava/lang/String;II)V**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7233433723449707 with `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippet for this API involves `Process.myUid()`, which implies it deals with system-level operations or user ID checks, likely requiring system or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - **getRestrictBackgroundByCaller()I**: With a similarity score of 0.7162646055221558, this API is assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. Its code involves `Binder.getCallingUid()`, indicating it fetches the user ID of the calling process, which could be related to managing background restrictions based on the caller's identity.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` does not seem to handle sensitive data or require specific permissions to operate (unlike `setVpnPackageAuthorization`), and considering its simplicity compared to `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller`, we can infer its access control requirements.
   - The method's operation is straightforward, returning a constant value without interacting with system-level resources that would necessitate elevated permissions.

Based on the analysis, since the method does not appear to handle sensitive information or require specific system permissions, and given the comparisons with similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` seems to be `NORMAL`. This is because it doesn't fit into the `SYS_OR_SIG` category due to lack of system-level interactions, nor does it warrant `DANGEROUS` or `NONE` based on the provided information.

The final access control level in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
