Based on the provided code, I will analyze it to identify potential sinks.

The given method `getRestrictBackground()` returns a field `mRestrictBackground`. This field access has naming similarity with the API name `getRestrictBackground`.

Here is the JSON output:
```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "return this.mRestrictBackground;"
    ]
]
}
```
