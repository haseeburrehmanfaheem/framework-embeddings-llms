To determine the access control level for the `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method checks if a specific UID is restricted on metered networks by retrieving its state from `mUidBlockedState`. If the state indicates a restriction (based on the bitwise operation), it returns a value indicating whether the UID is restricted.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves getting an object (`v2`) from `this.mUidBlockedState` based on the provided `p1` (UID). This suggests interaction with network policy states for specific UIDs.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isUidNetworkingBlocked(IZ)Z**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7539963126182556 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It checks if networking is blocked for a UID, involving similar operations with `mUidBlockedState` and logging network policy changes.
   - **setUidPolicy(II)V**: With a similarity score of 0.7139033079147339 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, this API sets the policy for a specific UID by updating `mUidPolicy`.

Given these similarities and the context provided:
- Both similar APIs (`isUidNetworkingBlocked` and `setUidPolicy`) have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This suggests that operations related to checking or setting network policies for UIDs require system or signature-level permissions, likely due to their potential impact on device security and functionality.
- The `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` method interacts with similar data structures (`mUidBlockedState`) and is concerned with determining restrictions based on network policies. This implies it could potentially reveal sensitive information about a device's configuration or affect how applications behave under different network conditions.

Considering these points, the logical conclusion for the access control level of `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` would align with the similar APIs provided, indicating that it should also be classified as SYS_OR_SIG due to its involvement in sensitive network policy operations and potential impact on system security and functionality.
