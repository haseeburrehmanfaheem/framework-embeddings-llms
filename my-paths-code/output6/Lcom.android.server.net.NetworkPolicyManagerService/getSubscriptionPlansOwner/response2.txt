To determine the access control level for the `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method has a simple implementation:
```java
public String getSubscriptionPlansOwner(int p1){
    Object v2 = this.mSubscriptionPlansOwner.get(p1);
    return v2;
}
```
It retrieves an object from a collection (`mSubscriptionPlansOwner`) based on the input parameter `p1` and returns it.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `setSubscriptionPlans(I[Landroid/telephony/SubscriptionPlan;JLjava/lang/String;)V` with a similarity score of 0.799209713935852 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method updates the subscription plans and their owners.
2. `setSubscriptionOverride(III[IJLjava/lang/String;)V` with a similarity score of 0.7908856868743896 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method overrides subscription settings.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. However, the `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method only retrieves data from a collection and does not modify any sensitive information.

Considering the semantics of the `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method and its similarities with the provided APIs, it is likely that this method does not require system or signature-level permissions to execute. Instead, it seems to be a normal getter method that returns information about subscription plans.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method.

```json
{
    "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
