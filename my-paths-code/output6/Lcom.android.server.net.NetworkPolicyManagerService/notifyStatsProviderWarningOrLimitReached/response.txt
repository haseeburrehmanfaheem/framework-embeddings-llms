Based on the provided code, here is the analysis of potential sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "Message v3 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(20);",  
        "v3.sendToTarget();"
    ]
]
}
```
The identified sink involves creating a new `Message` object and sending it to its target. This sequence follows one of the positive rules, specifically the creation of a new object with dataflow from the API's internal state (the message code `20`). However, considering the context and sensitivity, this operation seems more related to an internal notification rather than handling sensitive data directly. 

Since there are no other operations in this method that clearly follow the positive rules for identifying sinks, especially those dealing with access control or sensitive data handling, this analysis focuses on the method invocation sequence that could potentially influence system behavior based on the `mSystemReady` condition and message sending.
