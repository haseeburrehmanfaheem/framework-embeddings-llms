To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we should analyze its behavior, the sinks it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs provided. 

The given `onReceive` method initializes a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing parameters to it, and then starts this instance. The similar APIs provided also perform the same operation: initializing an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` (or presumably a very similar class) and starting it.

The key points to consider for assigning an access control level are:
- **NONE**: Typically assigned when the method does not pose any risk regarding user privacy or system integrity.
- **NORMAL**: Applied when the method might have some implications but doesn't directly affect sensitive data or critical system functions without additional permissions or checks.
- **DANGEROUS**: Used for methods that can directly impact user privacy, financial information, or system security. This often includes operations like accessing location data, contacts, making payments, etc., without proper authorization.
- **SYS_OR_SIG**: Reserved for operations requiring system or signature-level permissions, which are not typically accessible to third-party applications and are critical for the system's operation.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that the operations performed by these methods (and presumably by the `onReceive` method in question) do not pose significant risks regarding user data or system integrity. They seem to be related to handling broadcast intents and updating configurations, which are common operations within Android applications.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the similarity with other APIs that have been assigned `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `onReceive` method should also be `NONE`.
