To analyze this code and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, let's break down the execution flow:

1. The method `onReceive` is invoked with parameters `Context p1` and `Intent p2`.
2. An object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` as arguments to its constructor.
3. The `start()` method is called on the newly created object.

Considering the positive rules:

- Method invocations: `new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1)` and `v1.start()` are method invocations where `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` has a naming similarity with the API name, but more importantly, it's created using data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and `p1`). The `start()` method does not directly follow the positive rules based on the information given but is crucial for the execution of the object created.

- Field access and updates: There are no explicit field accesses or updates in this code snippet that fit the criteria.

- Object creation: The creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` uses data flow from the API parameters, fitting one of the positive rules.

Given these points, we can identify a potential sink set as follows:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v1.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This sink set involves the creation of an object using API parameters and the subsequent invocation of a method on that object, which collectively contribute to a potential data flow or action based on the input received by the `onReceive` method. Since there's only one identified set of instructions contributing to a sink in this analysis, ranking from most sensitive to least sensitive is not applicable here as we have a single coherent set.
