Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `addOnAppsChangedListener` method.

The `addOnAppsChangedListener` method has two paths with a depth of 2, and both paths interact with the same sinks: `getPackageUid` and `register`. The sink code snippets show that the method registers a callback listener for app changes.

The similar APIs provided are `registerPackageInstallerCallback`, which have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with the `getPackageUid` sink, but they register a different type of callback listener.

Considering the similarity in code structure and sinks between `addOnAppsChangedListener` and `registerPackageInstallerCallback`, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `addOnAppsChangedListener`.

However, since the `addOnAppsChangedListener` method deals with app changes, which might be sensitive information, a more restrictive access control level could be justified. But based on the provided similar APIs and their access control levels, we can conclude that the access control level of `addOnAppsChangedListener` is likely `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
