To determine the access control level for the `getShortcutIconUri` method, we must analyze its behavior, the similar APIs provided, and their respective access control levels.

1. **Analysis of getShortcutIconUri**:
   - The method involves checking the calling user ID (`v4 = ILauncherApps$Stub.getCallingUid();`) and comparing it with the user ID passed as a parameter (`p1`).
   - It uses `UserHandle.getUserId(v6);` to get the user ID from the calling UID, which implies handling of user-specific data.
   - The method also checks if a profile is accessible using `this.mUserManagerInternal.isProfileAccessible(v5, p1, p2, 1);`, indicating some form of access control or permission check related to user profiles.
   - It then asynchronously retrieves the shortcut icon URI through `this.mShortcutServiceInternal.getShortcutIconUriAsync(v28, p1, p2, p3, p4, v26);`, which suggests interaction with a service that might have its own access control mechanisms.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `getShortcutIconResId` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method seems to directly return the resource ID of a shortcut icon without explicit permission checks or asynchronous service calls.
   - Despite the similarity in functionality (both deal with shortcut icons), the absence of explicit permission checks in `getShortcutIconResId` might suggest that the icons are considered less sensitive or that access control is handled at a different layer.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Considering the explicit user ID and profile accessibility checks within `getShortcutIconUri`, it indicates a level of sensitivity regarding user data and permissions.
   - However, the similar APIs (`getShortcutIconResId`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that the system might not consider shortcut icon URIs or resource IDs as highly sensitive information requiring strict access control (like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`).
   - Given the method's interaction with user-specific data and services, but lacking explicit dangerous permission checks (e.g., those typically associated with `android.permission` flags), it leans towards a less restrictive access control level.

**Conclusion**: The `getShortcutIconUri` method involves handling of user-specific data and interacts with system services, but based on the similar APIs and the nature of its functionality, it does not seem to require the most stringent access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`. Therefore, considering the balance between its need to access user-specific information and the similarity with other APIs labeled as `NONE`, a reasonable assignment would be `NORMAL`, reflecting some level of access control without requiring explicit dangerous permissions.
