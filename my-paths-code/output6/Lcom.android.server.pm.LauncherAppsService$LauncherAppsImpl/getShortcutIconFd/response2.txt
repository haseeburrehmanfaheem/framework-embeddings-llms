To determine the access control level for the `getShortcutIconFd` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The code snippets show that `getShortcutIconFd` performs checks on the user ID and profile accessibility before proceeding to call `mShortcutServiceInternal.getShortcutIconFdAsync`. This indicates some form of access control or permission check.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs, `getShortcutIconUri`, have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - Their code snippets are relatively straightforward, directly calling `getShortcutIconUriAsync` without explicit permission checks beyond getting the user ID.
   
3. **Sink Code**: The sink code for `getShortcutIconFd` also involves calling an async method (`getShortcutIconFdAsync`) and then returning the result. This pattern is similar to the `getShortcutIconUri` APIs.

4. **Access Control Checks in getShortcutIconFd**:
   - Despite the similarity in the final call (to an async method), `getShortcutIconFd` includes checks on user profiles (`isProfileAccessible`) and clears/restores calling identity, which suggests a more complex access control scenario than what's present in the provided `getShortcutIconUri` examples.

Considering these points:
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, but they lack the explicit permission and profile checks present in `getShortcutIconFd`.
- The presence of `isProfileAccessible` checks and the manipulation of calling identities suggests that `getShortcutIconFd` is enforcing some level of access control based on user profiles, which goes beyond a simple `NONE` access control level.
- However, these checks do not clearly indicate a need for system or signature-level permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG`) since they relate more to profile management within the app's scope rather than system-wide permissions.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects the presence of some access control mechanisms (like profile checks) without requiring system-level permissions. The provided similar APIs, despite having a `NONE` access control level, do not exhibit the same level of internal permission checking as `getShortcutIconFd`.
