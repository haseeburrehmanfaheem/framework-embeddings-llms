To determine the access control level for the `removeSession2TokensListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves removing a listener from a list of session 2 tokens listener records. It uses `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the PID and UID of the calling process, indicating some level of security or access control check.

2. **Sink Code**:
   - `int v1 = Binder.getCallingPid();` and `int v2 = Binder.getCallingUid();`: These lines retrieve the process ID and user ID of the caller, which can be used for security checks or logging purposes.
   - `List v11 = MediaSessionService.-$$Nest$fgetmSession2TokensListenerRecords(this.this$0); Object v12 = v11.remove(v5);`: This part removes an item from a list based on some condition, suggesting management of listeners.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getRestrictBackgroundByCaller()I**: With a similarity score of 0.9358068704605103 and an access control level of NORMAL. It uses `Binder.getCallingUid();` to get the caller's UID, implying some form of access control or restriction based on the caller's identity.
   - **registerRemoteAnimationsForDisplay(ILandroid/view/RemoteAnimationDefinition;)V**: With a similarity score of 0.9209071397781372 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It involves registering remote animations and uses `Binder.getCallingUid();` for access control purposes, suggesting that system or signature-level permission is required.

Given the information:

- The method does involve security-related checks using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`, which suggests some level of access control.
- The removal of a listener could potentially affect the behavior or security posture of the application, but it doesn't seem to directly interact with sensitive data or system resources that would require SYS_OR_SIG permission.
- The similarity with `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller()` which has a NORMAL access control level suggests that the operation might not require high-level permissions like SYS_OR_SIG.

Considering these points, the method seems to be managing listeners based on caller identity without directly accessing sensitive system resources or data. Thus, it appears to require some form of access control but does not seem to necessitate system or signature-level permissions. Therefore, a reasonable assignment for its access control level would be NORMAL, as it involves checks related to the caller's identity but doesn't seem to pose significant risks that would warrant higher protection levels.
