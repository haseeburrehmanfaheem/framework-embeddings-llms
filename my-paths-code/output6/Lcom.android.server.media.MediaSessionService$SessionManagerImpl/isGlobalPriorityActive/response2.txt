To determine the access control level for the `isGlobalPriorityActive` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet for `isGlobalPriorityActive` checks if `mGlobalPrioritySession` is active and returns a boolean value based on this condition. It involves accessing and manipulating internal state (`this.mGlobalPrioritySession`) but does not explicitly perform any operations that would typically require elevated permissions (e.g., network access, file I/O, etc.).

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code points to the line where `mGlobalPrioritySession.isActive()` is called and a return statement. This suggests that the critical operation in terms of security or privacy is related to checking the active status of a session.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isClientActive()Z**: This method has a similarity score of 0.7617092132568359 with `isGlobalPriorityActive` and is assigned an access control level of NORMAL. It simply returns the value of `this.mIsActive`, which implies that accessing or checking the status of internal variables or states is considered a normal operation.
   - **dispatchVolumeKeyEvent**: Although this method has a lower similarity score (0.7384310960769653) and is assigned an access control level of NONE, it's involved in more complex operations related to event dispatching and validation of stream types. The presence of `MediaSessionService.-$$Nest$misGlobalPriorityActiveLocked` suggests an interaction with global priority session status but does not directly influence the access control decision for `isGlobalPriorityActive`.

Given these points, the key factors influencing the access control level are:
- The method's primary operation is checking and returning the status of an internal session.
- Similar methods that check internal states or statuses have been assigned NORMAL access control levels.

Considering these factors, assigning an access control level of **NORMAL** to `isGlobalPriorityActive` seems appropriate. This decision is based on the method's functionality being comparable to other methods that check and return internal status flags without requiring special permissions or posing significant security risks.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
