After reviewing the provided code snippets and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `removeSessionsListener` method.

The `removeSessionsListener` method appears to be removing a listener from a list of sessions listeners. The method takes an `IActiveSessionsListener` object as a parameter and removes it from the list if it exists.

The similar APIs provided, `addSessionsListener`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are adding a listener to the list of sessions listeners and linking the listener's death to the service. The fact that these methods require a signature or system-level permission suggests that the listeners are sensitive and should be protected from unauthorized access.

The `removeSessionsListener` method, on the other hand, is removing a listener from the list. This operation does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it is not adding a new listener or modifying the existing listeners in a way that could compromise the system's security.

However, considering the similarity between the `removeSessionsListener` and `addSessionsListener` methods, and the fact that they operate on the same list of sessions listeners, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeSessionsListener` method as well. This is because removing a listener could potentially be used to disrupt the normal functioning of the system or to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `removeSessionsListener` method is protected from unauthorized access and requires a signature or system-level permission to execute.
