To assign an access control level to the `hasCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets for `hasCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` show that this method checks if a custom media key dispatcher is set and, in one of the paths, compares the name of the class of the custom media key dispatcher with the input string `p1`. The method does not seem to perform any operations that could be considered dangerous or require special system permissions. It primarily involves checking and comparing values without modifying any sensitive data or performing actions that could compromise security.

The similar APIs provided, such as `setCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` and `hasCustomMediaSessionPolicyProvider`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods either set a custom dispatcher/provider or check if a specific provider is set based on the input string. Their operations are comparable to those in `hasCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` in terms of not directly accessing sensitive information or performing dangerous actions.

Given this analysis, the `hasCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` method does not appear to pose any significant security risks. It does not access sensitive data, perform dangerous operations, or require special system or signature permissions. Therefore, it should have a similar access control level as the provided similar APIs.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the method's functionality and comparison with similar APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not pose significant security risks and do not require elevated permissions to execute.
