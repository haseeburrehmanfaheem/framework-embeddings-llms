Here are the potential sinks for both APIs in JSON format:

**Path 1: isSettingRestrictedForUser with depth 1**
```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object v2 = p1.getSystemService(UserManage.class);",
      "boolean v7 = v2.hasUserRestriction(phiInstruction, v6);"
    ],
    [
      "Object v2 = Objects.requireNonNull(p2);",
      "int v3 = p2.hashCode();",
      "boolean v4 = p2.startsWith(\"data_roaming\");",
      "boolean v5 = 0.equals(p4);",
      "UserHandle v6 = UserHandle.of(p3);"
    ]
  ],
  "Ranking": [
    [0, 1],
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ]
}
```
In the first sink, there is a method invocation (`superSystemService`) and field access (`.hasUserRestriction`), which follows at least one of the positive rules.

In the second sink, there are multiple instructions that follow different rules. The `Objects.requireNonNull` and `hashCode` methods are potential sinks as they take input parameters (`p2`). However, without knowing the context or more information about `phiInstruction`, I cannot provide a definitive ranking. 

**Path 2: isSettingRestrictedForUser with depth 1**
```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object v2 = p1.getSystemService(UserManage.class);",
      "boolean v7 = v2.hasUserRestriction(phiInstruction, v6);"
    ],
    [
      "int v3 = p2.hashCode();",
      "boolean v4 = p2.startsWith(\"data_roaming\");",
      "boolean v5 = 0.equals(p4);"
    ]
  ],
  "Ranking": [
    [0, 1],
    [1, 2, 3]
  ]
}
```
This path has similar issues as Path 1. The first sink still follows the rules, while the second sink only has one instruction that takes input parameters (`p2`).
