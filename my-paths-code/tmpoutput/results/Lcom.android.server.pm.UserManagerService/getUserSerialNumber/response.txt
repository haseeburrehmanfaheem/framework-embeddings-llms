Here are the potential sinks for each path:

**Path 1:**

```json
"Sinks": [
    [
        "Object v1 = this.mUsers.get(p1);",
        "boolean v2 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);"
    ],
    [
        "UserInfo v1 = p0.getUserInfoLU(p1);"
    ]
]
```

**Path 2:**

```json
"Sinks": [
    [
        "Object v1 = this.mUsers.get(p1);",
        "boolean v2 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);"
    ],
    [
        "UserInfo v1 = p0.getUserInfoLU(p1);"
    ]
]
```

Both paths have a common set of instructions that contribute to the sink, which is accessing fields `mUsers` and `mRemovingUserIds`. The sinks are ranked as follows:

- **Path 1**: Returns UserInfo object directly from `getUserInfoLU`, making it more sensitive.
- **Ranking order**:
    1. Path 1
    2. Path 2

The instructions in the second sink set do not follow any of the positive rules and are therefore considered sinks with low sensitivity.
