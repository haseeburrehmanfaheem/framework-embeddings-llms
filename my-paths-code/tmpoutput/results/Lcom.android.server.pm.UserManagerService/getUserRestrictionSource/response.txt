Here is the JSON response with identified sinks for both APIs:

**API 1**

{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List v1 = p0.getUserRestrictionSources(p1, p2);",
      "int v2 = v1.size();",
      "return phiInstruction;"
    ],
    [
      "int v2 = this.mNative.getBaseUserRestriction(p1, p2);"
    ]
  ]
}

**API 2**

{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List v1 = p0.getUserRestrictionSources(p1, p2);",
      "ArrayList v2 = new ArrayList();",
      "boolean v4 = p0.hasBaseUserRestriction(p1, p2);",
      "UserManager$EnforcingUser v4 = new UserManager$EnforcingUser(-10000,1);",
      "boolean v6 = v2.add(v4);"
    ],
    [
      "int v2 = this.mNative.getDevicePolicyLocalRestrictionsForTargetUserLR(p2);"
    ]
  ]
}

Note that for API 1, I only identified one sink, as the `getLightState` method does not have any other potential sinks. For API 2, I identified two sinks: one related to `getUserRestrictionSources`, and another related to `getDevicePolicyLocalRestrictionsForTargetUserLR`.

Both sinks are ranked as sensitive, as they both involve creating or updating objects that contain sensitive information (e.g., user restrictions).
