Here is the JSON response for the two API paths:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserManagerService$UserData v3 = p0.getUserDataLU(v2);",
      "UserManagerService$UserData v3;",
      "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int v2 = UserHandle.getUserId(v1);"
    ],
    [
      "Object v1 = this.mUsers.get(p1);",
      "boolean v2 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);",
      "return v1;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Note that the sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive. In both cases, the API returns an object (`UserManagerService$UserData`), making them potentially sensitive. However, in the second case, the returned value is not further processed or accessed, whereas in the first case, it is used to create another object and then returned.

In terms of specific rules applied:

* Positive rule 1: Method invoked (both native and other inner methods) - The `getUserDataLU` method matches this rule.
* Positive rule 2: Field get cases - The `getUserDataLU` method returns an instance variable (`this.mUsers.get(p1)`), which is a field access case that meets the rule. 
* Positive rule 3: Creation of new objects - In both cases, new objects are created using the returned values (in the first case, `UserManagerService$UserData v3` and in the second case, `Object v1`).
* Negative rules: None applied.

However, it is worth noting that the `getUserDataLU` method's return type is an integer (`return 0;`), which may not necessarily be sensitive data depending on its intended use.
