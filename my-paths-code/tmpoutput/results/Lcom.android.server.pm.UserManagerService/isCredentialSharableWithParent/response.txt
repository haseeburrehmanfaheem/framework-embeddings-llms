Here are the JSON objects representing potential sinks for each API:

**Path 1**

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean v3 = v2.isProfile();",
      "boolean v4 = v2.isCredentialSharableWithParent();",
      "lightState = new LightState(var1,var2);",
      "return lightState;"
    ]
  ],
  "Ranking": [
    0
  ]
}
```

This path contains a single sink that creates a `LightState` object using the inputs from the API, which is then returned by the API. This sink meets the positive rule of creating a new object with data flow from the API parameters.

**Path 2**

There are no potential sinks in this path.

**Path 3**

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean v3 = v2.isProfile();",
      "boolean v4 = v2.isCredentialSharableWithParent();",
      "lightState = new LightState(var1,var2);",
      "return lightState;"
    ]
  ],
  "Ranking": [
    0
  ]
}
```

This path also contains a single sink that creates a `LightState` object using the inputs from the API, which is then returned by the API. This sink meets the same positive rule as Path 1.

Note that both paths contain sinks that meet the same positive rules (creating a new object with data flow from the API parameters) and have the same ranking (most sensitive).
