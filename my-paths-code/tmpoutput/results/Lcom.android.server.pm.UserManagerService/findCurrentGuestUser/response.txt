Here is the JSON with sinks for both APIs:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "boolean v1 = UserManagerService.hasManageUsersPermission();",
        "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();"
    ],
    [
        "boolean v1 = UserManagerService.hasManageUsersPermission(v1);"
    ]
],
[
    [
        "UserInfo info = new UserInfo();"
    ]
]
}
```

Note that I didn't rank the sinks, as there is only one set of instructions per API. However, sink 2 in both APIs are similar and can be ranked based on sensitivity, but considering the exact definition provided, they do not fit into any category of positive rules.

However, if you would like to consider them similar enough to be ranked by similarity or another metric, here is an updated version:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "boolean v1 = UserManagerService.hasManageUsersPermission();",
        "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();"
    ],
    [
        "UserInfo info = new UserInfo();"
    ],
    [
        "boolean v1 = UserManagerService.hasManageUsersPermission(v1);"
    ]
],
[
    [
        "boolean v1 = UserManagerService.hasManageUsersPermission();"
    ]
]
}
```

In the second set of sinks, we added another sink that was present in both APIs. However, it's worth noting that this particular API does not seem to contain any sensitive data or operations that would require access control. The `UserInfo` class is simply returned without any modifications, and its contents are not accessed or updated by the API itself.
