Here is the JSON with all sinks for each path:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "StringBuilder v1 = new StringBuilder();",
      "StringBuilder v3 = v1.append('get application restrictions for other user/app ');",
      "StringBuilder v4 = v1.append(p1);",
      "String v5 = v1.toString();",
      "UserManagerService.checkSystemOrRoot(v5);",
      "Bundle v7 = UserManagerService.readApplicationRestrictionsLAr(p1, p2);"
    ],
    [
      "code 1"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This path has only one sink with a high naming similarity to the API name `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` and is followed by a method call that processes the input parameters.

Here are similar JSONs for paths 2 and 3:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "StringBuilder v4 = new StringBuilder();",
      "StringBuilder v6 = v4.append('get application restrictions for other user/app ');",
      "StringBuilder v7 = v4.append(p1);",
      "String v8 = v4.toString();",
      "UserManagerService.checkSystemOrRoot(v8);",
      "Bundle v10 = UserManagerService.readApplicationRestrictionsLAr(p1, p2);"
    ],
    [
      "code 1"
    ]
  ]
}
```

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "StringBuilder v1 = new StringBuilder();",
      "StringBuilder v3 = v1.append('get application restrictions for other user/app ');",
      "StringBuilder v4 = v1.append(p1);",
      "String v5 = v1.toString();",
      "UserManagerService.checkSystemOrRoot(v5);",
      "Bundle v7 = UserManagerService.readApplicationRestrictionsLAr(p1, p2);"
    ],
    [
      "code 1"
    ]
  ]
}
```

These paths have the same sink with high naming similarity to the API name `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` and are followed by a method call that processes the input parameters.

Note that there is no data flow link between instructions in these sinks, so they should be treated as separate sinks.
