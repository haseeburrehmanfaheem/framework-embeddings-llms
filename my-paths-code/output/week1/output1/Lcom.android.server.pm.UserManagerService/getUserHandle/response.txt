Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public int getUserHandle(int p1){
    return -1;
}
```

Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow any of the positive rules and no data flow from API parameters to a new object creation or other sinks, we can conclude that this API does not contain any potential sinks according to the provided rules.

Therefore, the JSON response with an empty list for "Sinks" would be:

```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that no potential sink was found in the provided code.
