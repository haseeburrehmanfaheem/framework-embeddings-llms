To analyze the given API paths and identify potential sinks that require access control, we'll examine each path step by step. Given the instructions:

- **Method invocations** should have naming similarity with the API name or take input parameters as arguments, or their return value is returned by the API.
- **Field get cases** must have naming similarity with the API name and be returned by the API or used with other sink cases.
- **Field set cases** should either have naming similarity with the API name or be modified with the API parameters.
- **Creation of new objects** should either have naming similarity to the API or be created with data flow from the API parameters, and they must be returned by the API or used with other sink cases.

For both paths provided:

1. The `isSameProfileGroup` method invokes `checkQueryUsersPermission`, which in turn calls `hasQueryUsersPermission`. However, these methods do not directly process the input parameters (`p1` and `p2`) of the `isSameProfileGroup` API but are involved in permission checks.

2. The `isSameProfileGroupNoChecks` method is called by `isSameProfileGroup`, which then invokes `getUserInfoLU` twice with the input parameters `p1` and `p2`. This indicates a direct data flow from the API's input parameters to the creation of `UserInfo` objects, making these invocations potential sinks.

3. The `getUserInfoLU` method accesses fields (`this.mUsers`, `this.mRemovingUserIds`) based on the input parameter `p1` (or `p2`). Since these fields are accessed in a manner that depends directly on the API's input parameters and considering their usage in creating `UserInfo` objects, they contribute to identifying potential sinks.

Given these observations:

- The method invocation `checkQueryUsersPermission` does not process the input parameters (`p1`, `p2`) but is part of the permission check flow. However, its call doesn't directly lead to a sink related to the API's main functionality.
  
- The invocations of `getUserInfoLU` with `p1` and `p2` are directly influenced by the API's input parameters and contribute to creating objects that are used within the API's logic.

Considering these points, we can identify potential sinks in the provided paths. However, it's essential to rank them based on their sensitivity and direct involvement with the API's core functionality:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserInfo v1 = p0.getUserInfoLU(p1);",
      "UserInfo v2 = p0.getUserInfoLU(p2);"
    ],
    [
      "Object v1 = this.mUsers.get(p1);",
      "boolean v2 = this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

In the above JSON, the most sensitive sink is considered to be the creation and usage of `UserInfo` objects (`v1` and `v2`) directly influenced by the API's input parameters (`p1` and `p2`). The access to fields `this.mUsers` and `this.mRemovingUserIds` based on these input parameters also contributes to identifying potential sinks, albeit ranked lower in sensitivity due to their indirect contribution to the core functionality of returning a boolean value indicating whether two profiles are in the same group.
