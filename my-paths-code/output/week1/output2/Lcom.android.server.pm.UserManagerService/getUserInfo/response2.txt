In the absence of similar APIs to compare with, we must rely on general principles of assigning access control levels based on the potential risks and sensitive data that an API might interact with.

Here are the general guidelines for each level:

1. **NONE**: Typically assigned when the method doesn't pose any security risk and does not handle sensitive data.
2. **NORMAL**: Applies to methods that may handle some form of user data but do not pose significant security risks.
3. **DANGEROUS**: Given to methods that deal with sensitive data or operations that could potentially harm the system or user, such as financial transactions, personal data access, etc.
4. **SYS_OR_SIG**: Reserved for system-level operations that require special permissions and are typically used by system applications or those signed with the platform key.

Given no specific information about the `original_method` API's functionality, interactions, or what kind of data it handles, we must default to a cautious approach. If an API is new and there's no clear indication of its interaction with sensitive data or system-level operations, but without explicit details suggesting it poses no risk (e.g., purely informational or utility methods that do not touch user data), the safest assumption leans towards **NORMAL** as a baseline for most general-purpose APIs.

Therefore, based on this cautious approach and lacking specific details about the API's functionality:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision assumes that without evidence of system-level impact or sensitive data handling, an API should start with a moderate access control level. Adjustments can be made as more information becomes available regarding its actual usage and potential risks.
