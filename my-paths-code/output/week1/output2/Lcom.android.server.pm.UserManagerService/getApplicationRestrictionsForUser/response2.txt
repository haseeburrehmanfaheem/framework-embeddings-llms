To assign an access control level to the `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` method has three paths with a depth of 2. All paths call `UserManagerService.checkSystemOrRoot` and then `UserManagerService.readApplicationRestrictionsLAr`. The `checkSystemOrRoot` method is used to check if the caller is a system or root user, which suggests that this method requires some level of access control.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which means they can only be called by system or signature applications. These APIs also call `UserManagerService.readApplicationRestrictionsLAr` and perform similar operations to the `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` method.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` method requires a similar level of access control as the similar APIs. Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
