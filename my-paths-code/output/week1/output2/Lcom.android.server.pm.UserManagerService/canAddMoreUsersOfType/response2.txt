To determine the access control level for the `canAddMoreUsersOfType` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `canAddMoreUsersOfType` method has three code paths with a depth of 2. In all paths, it calls `UserManagerService.checkCreateUsersPermission("check if more users can be added.")`, which in turn checks for the `CREATE_USERS` permission using `hasCreateUsersPermission()`. This suggests that the method is related to user management and requires specific permissions.

The sink code snippets indicate that the method interacts with `mUserTypes` and checks for the `CREATE_USERS` permission. These interactions are similar to those found in the provided similar APIs, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The similar API `getPreInstallableSystemPackages(Ljava/lang/String;)[Ljava/lang/String;` has a similarity score of 0.8278 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also checks for the `CREATE_USERS` permission using `hasCreateUsersPermission()`.

Another similar API, `getRemainingCreatableProfileCount(Ljava/lang/String;I)I`, has a similarity score of 0.8046 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with `mUserTypes` and checks for the enabled state and managed profile status.

Considering these factors, it appears that the `canAddMoreUsersOfType` method requires system or signature-level permission to execute, similar to the provided similar APIs.

The final access control level for the API is:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
