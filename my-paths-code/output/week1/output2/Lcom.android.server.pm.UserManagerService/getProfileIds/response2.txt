In that case, I'll need to rely on general principles of assigning access control levels.

Since no similar APIs were found, I'll consider the following factors:

1. Is the method related to sensitive data or functionality?
2. Can the method be used to compromise the security or privacy of the user or device?

Without more information about the specific method, it's difficult to make an informed decision. However, as a general rule, if a method doesn't interact with sensitive data or functionality, it's likely to have a lower access control level.

Assuming the method is not related to sensitive data or functionality, I would assign an access control level of "NONE".

Here is my response in JSON format:

```
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
