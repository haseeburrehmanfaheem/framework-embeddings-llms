In that case, I will rely on general principles to determine the access control level for the new Android method.

Since no similar APIs are available for comparison, I will consider the following factors:

1. **Method name and description**: Unfortunately, you haven't provided the method name or description. If you provide this information, I can make a more informed decision.
2. **Default access control levels**: In general, if an API is not explicitly marked as sensitive or restricted, it's common to assign a moderate access control level.

Given the lack of information about the specific method, I will err on the side of caution and choose a moderate access control level.

Here's my tentative assignment:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

Please provide more context or information about the method, such as its name, description, or any relevant details. This will help me refine my decision and assign a more accurate access control level.
