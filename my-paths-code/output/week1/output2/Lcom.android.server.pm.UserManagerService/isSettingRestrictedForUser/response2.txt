Since no similar APIs were found, we'll have to rely on general guidelines for assigning access control levels.

Given that this is a new Android method, we can consider the following factors:

1. **Method's purpose**: Without knowing the exact purpose of the method, it's difficult to determine its potential impact.
2. **Potential risks**: If the method interacts with sensitive data, hardware components, or performs actions that could potentially harm the system or user, it might require a higher access control level.

In the absence of more information, I would err on the side of caution and assign a moderate access control level.

Here's my decision:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This is because `NORMAL` is a reasonable default for many Android methods, as it allows for some protection while still permitting legitimate uses. However, if more information about the method's purpose or potential risks becomes available, this decision may need to be revisited.
