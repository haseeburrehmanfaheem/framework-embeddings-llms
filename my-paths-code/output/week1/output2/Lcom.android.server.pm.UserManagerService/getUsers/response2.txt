In that case, I will rely on general principles to determine the access control level for the new Android method.

Since there are no similar APIs to compare with, I will consider the following factors:

1. **Method name and description**: Unfortunately, you didn't provide the method name and description. If you provide this information, I can make a more informed decision.
2. **Default access control levels**: In Android, methods that don't interact with sensitive data or resources typically have an access control level of `NONE` or `NORMAL`.
3. **Potential risks**: Without knowing the specifics of the method, it's difficult to assess potential risks. If the method interacts with sensitive data, user privacy, or system resources, a higher access control level might be necessary.

Given these factors and the lack of information about the method, I will make a conservative estimate.

Here is my assessment:

{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }

Please provide more context or information about the method if you'd like me to reassess.
