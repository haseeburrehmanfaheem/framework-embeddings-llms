In the absence of similar APIs to compare with, we must rely on general principles of assigning access control levels based on the potential impact of the method on system security, user data, and device functionality.

Given that no specific details about the "new android method" are provided, such as its name, parameters, return values, or what it does, making a precise determination is challenging. However, I can guide you through a general approach to deciding on an access control level:

1. **NONE**: Typically used for methods that do not pose any security risk and do not require any special permissions. These are usually informational or utility methods that do not affect system state or user data significantly.

2. **NORMAL**: Applies to methods that can have some impact on the system or user data but are generally considered safe when used appropriately. They might require standard Android permissions, which users can grant without significant security risks.

3. **DANGEROUS**: This level is assigned to methods that could pose a significant risk if misused, such as those dealing with sensitive user information, financial transactions, or system modifications. Methods at this level usually require explicit permission from the user and are subject to stricter review.

4. **SYS_OR_SIG**: Used for system-level operations or those that require signature-level permissions, which are typically reserved for system apps or apps signed with the platform key. These methods can significantly affect system security or functionality.

Without specifics about the method's behavior or potential risks, the safest assumption might lean towards "NONE" if we consider a very generic and non-intrusive method. However, this is speculative without more details.

Given no information to suggest significant risk or impact:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

Please note, this decision is highly speculative due to the lack of specific information about the method in question. Real-world access control level assignments would depend on a thorough analysis of what the method does and its potential impacts.
