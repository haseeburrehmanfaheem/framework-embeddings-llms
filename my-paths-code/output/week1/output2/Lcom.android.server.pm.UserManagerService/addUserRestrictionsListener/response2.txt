In the absence of similar APIs or ground truth examples to inform the decision, a default approach would be to consider the general principles of assigning access control levels based on the potential impact and sensitivity of the method's functionality.

1. **NONE**: Typically assigned when the method does not access sensitive information and does not pose a risk to user data or system security.
2. **NORMAL**: Applies when the method accesses or modifies user data but is generally considered safe with standard permissions (e.g., internet access).
3. **DANGEROUS**: Used for methods that can cause financial loss, physically harm the user, or significantly compromise user privacy (e.g., sending SMS, making calls).
4. **SYS_OR_SIG**: Usually required for operations that are signature or system level and thus pose significant risks if misused.

Without specifics on what `original_method` does, it's challenging to accurately determine its access control level. However, given the lack of information about sensitive operations (like financial transactions, accessing user location, contacts, etc.), one might lean towards a more cautious but still generalized approach:

If `original_method` doesn't seem to interact with sensitive data or perform risky operations based on its name alone (which isn't provided), and without further context, the most conservative yet reasonable guess would be **NORMAL**, assuming it's part of an application's standard functionality that might require some form of access control but not at the highest levels.

Thus, the final access control level for `original_method`, given no specific details about its functionality or similar APIs to reference, could be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

Please note, this is a very generalized approach and should ideally be informed by more specific details about what `original_method` does.
