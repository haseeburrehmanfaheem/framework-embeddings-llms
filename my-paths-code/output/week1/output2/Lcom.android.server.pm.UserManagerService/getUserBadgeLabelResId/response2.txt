Based on the provided code and similar APIs, we can analyze the access control level for the `getUserBadgeLabelResId` method.

The method `getUserBadgeLabelResId` checks for manage or interact permission if the caller is in another profile group using the `checkManageOrInteractPermissionIfCallerInOtherProfileGroup` method. This method also checks if the user has the `android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` permission and the `hasManageUsersPermission`. 

The similar APIs, `getUserBadgeColorResId` and `getUserBadgeResId`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and also check for manage or interact permission and the `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` permission.

Given that the `getUserBadgeLabelResId` method performs similar checks to the similar APIs, it is likely that this method should also have a similar access control level. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
