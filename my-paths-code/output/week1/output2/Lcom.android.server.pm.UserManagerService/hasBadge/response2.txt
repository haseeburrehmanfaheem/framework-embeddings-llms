To determine the access control level for the `hasBadge` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `hasBadge` API has the following characteristics:

1. It calls `checkManageOrInteractPermissionIfCallerInOtherProfileGroup`, which checks for manage users permission or interact across users permission.
2. It retrieves user type details using `getUserTypeDetailsNoChecks`.
3. It accesses a badge property of the user type details.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `getUserBadgeResId` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and also calls `checkManageOrInteractPermissionIfCallerInOtherProfileGroup`. Its code is very similar to `hasBadge`.
* `getUserBadgeLabelResId` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and calls `checkManageOrInteractPermissionIfCallerInOtherProfileGroup`. Its code is similar to `hasBadge`, but with an additional check for manage users permission.

Given the similarities in code and functionality, it's reasonable to conclude that the `hasBadge` API should have a similar access control level to the two comparable APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, the final access control level for the `hasBadge` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination is made by considering the similarities in code and functionality between `hasBadge` and the two comparable APIs (`getUserBadgeResId` and `getUserBadgeLabelResId`), which both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The `hasBadge` API's interaction with user profile information and its requirement for specific permissions align with the characteristics of APIs classified under the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
