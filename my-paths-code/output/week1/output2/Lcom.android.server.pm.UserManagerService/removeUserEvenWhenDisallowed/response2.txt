To determine the access control level for the `removeUserEvenWhenDisallowed` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method first calls `UserManagerService.checkCreateUsersPermission("Only the system can remove users");`, which implies that it checks if the caller has the permission to create users.
   - Then, it proceeds to call `p0.removeUserUnchecked(p1);`, suggesting an operation that involves removing a user without additional checks.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code indicates that the critical operations involve checking for the create users permission and then performing the removal of a user.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`removeUser(I)Z` and `markGuestForDeletion(I)Z`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods, which are similar in functionality to `removeUserEvenWhenDisallowed`, require either system-level privileges or a specific signature (permission) to be executed.

4. **Access Control Logic**:
   - Given the method's name (`removeUserEvenWhenDisallowed`), its behavior (removing users even when disallowed under normal circumstances), and the fact that it checks for create users permission, we can infer that this operation is sensitive.
   - The similar APIs also deal with user management and have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that such operations are restricted to system-level or specifically permitted processes.

Based on these analyses, the `removeUserEvenWhenDisallowed` method involves sensitive user management operations (removing users) that typically require high-level permissions. Given its similarity to other APIs with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level and considering the permission checks it performs, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a similar access control level to prevent unauthorized or malicious removal of users.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
