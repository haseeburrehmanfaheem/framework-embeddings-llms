In the absence of similar APIs to compare with, we must rely on general principles of assigning access control levels based on the potential risks and impacts associated with the method's functionality.

1. **NONE**: This level is typically assigned when the API does not pose any security risk or impact on user privacy. It's for methods that are completely innocuous.
2. **NORMAL**: This is the default level for most APIs. It's used for methods that could potentially have some impact but don't directly access sensitive data or powerful system capabilities without additional permissions or checks.
3. **DANGEROUS**: APIs with this level directly affect user privacy or system security, such as accessing location data, contacts, camera, microphone, etc., without explicit user consent or proper permission checks.
4. **SYS_OR_SIG**: This is for system-level or signature-level permissions which are typically reserved for system apps or apps signed with the platform key, indicating they require high levels of trust and access.

Without specific details about what the new Android method does (e.g., whether it accesses sensitive data, performs actions that could impact system security, or interacts with hardware in a way that requires permission), making an informed decision is challenging. 

However, if we must choose based on typical considerations for assigning access control levels and without any specifics indicating high risk or the need for elevated permissions:

{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }

This choice reflects a cautious approach, assuming that unless specified otherwise, most methods should have some form of oversight or permission check but may not necessarily require the highest level of access control.
