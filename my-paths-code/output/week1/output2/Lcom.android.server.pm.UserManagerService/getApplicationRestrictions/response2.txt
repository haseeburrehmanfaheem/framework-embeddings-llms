After analyzing the provided code snippets and similar APIs, I have determined that the `getApplicationRestrictions` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The reasoning behind this decision is as follows:

1. The `getApplicationRestrictions` method calls `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser`, which in turn calls `checkSystemOrRoot`. Although the `checkSystemOrRoot` method currently does nothing, its presence suggests that the API is intended to be restricted to system or signature applications.
2. The similar APIs provided, `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which further supports this decision.
3. The code snippets for the sinks also involve reading application restrictions from files, which could potentially contain sensitive information. Therefore, it is reasonable to restrict access to system or signature applications.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
