Since no similar APIs were found, we'll have to rely on general guidelines for assigning access control levels.

In Android, access control levels are typically assigned based on the potential risk or sensitivity of the API. Here's a brief overview of each level:

* NONE: No permission required, typically for APIs that don't pose a security risk.
* NORMAL: Permission required, but the API is not particularly sensitive.
* DANGEROUS: Permission required, and the API has the potential to cause harm or compromise user data.
* SYS_OR_SIG: Permission required, and the API is only accessible to system applications or applications signed with the same certificate as the system.

Without more information about the specific API, it's difficult to determine the exact access control level. However, since you asked me to provide an answer, I'll make a conservative guess:

{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }

Please note that this is a rough estimate and may not be accurate without more context or information about the API's functionality and potential risks. If you provide more details about the API, I can try to give a more informed answer.
