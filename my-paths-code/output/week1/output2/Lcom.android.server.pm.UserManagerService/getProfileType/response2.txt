Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getProfileType` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getProfileType` method checks for the `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` permission and also calls `hasQueryUsersPermission`, which suggests that it is interacting with user data. The similar APIs, `isPreCreated` and `isUserUnlocked`, also have a high similarity score and are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with user data and check for permissions such as `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` and `MANAGE_USERS`.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their assigned access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getProfileType` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, I assign the following access control level to the `getProfileType` API:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity between the `getProfileType` method and other APIs that interact with user data and require similar permissions. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level indicates that the method requires a system or signature permission to access the user data, which aligns with the permissions checked by the `getProfileType` method.
