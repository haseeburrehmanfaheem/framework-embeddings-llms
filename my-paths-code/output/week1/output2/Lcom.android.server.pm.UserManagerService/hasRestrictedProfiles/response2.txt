In the absence of similar APIs or ground truth to compare with, assigning an access control level requires a careful analysis of the method's potential impact on system security, user data, and privacy.

Given that no information is provided about the specific functionality, parameters, or return values of the `original_method` API, we must consider general principles for determining access control levels:

1. **NONE**: Typically assigned to methods that do not pose any risk to user data, system security, or privacy. These are usually informational or involve minimal operations that don't affect sensitive data.

2. **NORMAL**: Applies to methods that may have some impact on the system or user data but are generally considered safe when used appropriately by applications. This includes operations that might access non-sensitive user data or perform actions that could potentially be misused but are commonly needed for app functionality.

3. **DANGEROUS**: Reserved for methods that can significantly impact user privacy, system security, or have the potential to cause harm if not used carefully. Examples include accessing sensitive user data, performing operations that could lead to financial loss, or actions that require explicit user consent.

4. **SYS_OR_SIG**: Usually assigned to methods that are either signature-protected (requiring a specific permission signature to use) or system-level (available only to system apps or those with specific system-level permissions). These methods often deal with critical system operations, sensitive data access, or capabilities that could be used maliciously if not properly restricted.

Without specific details on what `original_method` does, the safest assumption would lean towards **NORMAL** as a default, considering it's a new Android method and most methods aim to balance functionality with security. However, this is speculative without more context.

Given the lack of information about the method's specifics, I will provide a tentative answer based on general principles:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

Please note, this assignment could change with more detailed information about `original_method`'s functionality and its potential impact on system security and user privacy.
