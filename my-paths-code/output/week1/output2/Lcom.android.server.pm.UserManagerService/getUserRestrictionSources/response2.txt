To determine the access control level for the `getUserRestrictionSources` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided `getUserRestrictionSources` method involves several key operations:
1. It checks if a base user restriction exists using `hasBaseUserRestriction`.
2. It adds an enforcing user to the result list.
3. It retrieves device policy local restrictions for a target user and adds their enforcing users to the list.
4. It also retrieves global user restrictions and adds those enforcing users to the list.

The method interacts with sensitive data related to user restrictions and enforcing users, which could potentially impact the security and privacy of the system if accessed improperly.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:
- `getUserRestrictionSource(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API is similar in that it also deals with retrieving user restriction sources, suggesting that such operations are sensitive and should be restricted to system or signature applications.
- `setUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;ZI)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method modifies user restrictions, which is a more critical operation than merely retrieving sources. Its access control level reinforces the idea that operations related to user restrictions are sensitive.

Given these observations:
- The `getUserRestrictionSources` method handles sensitive information regarding user restrictions and enforcing users.
- Similar APIs that deal with user restrictions have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are restricted to system or signature applications due to their sensitivity.

Therefore, considering the method's involvement with potentially sensitive user data and its similarity to other restricted APIs, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to ensure the security and privacy of the system.

The final access control level for the `getUserRestrictionSources` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
