In that case, I will need to rely on general guidelines for assigning access control levels to Android methods.

Since no similar APIs were found, I will consider the following factors:

* The method's name and purpose
* The potential risks or sensitive data it may handle
* The potential impact on the system or user data

Without more information about the specific method, I will make a conservative estimate.

If the method is not related to sensitive data or system resources, and does not pose a significant risk to the user or system, I would assign an access control level of "NONE".

However, if the method interacts with sensitive data, such as personal identifiable information, location data, or financial information, or if it has the potential to impact system resources or stability, I would assign an access control level of "NORMAL" or higher.

Given the lack of information about the specific method, I will err on the side of caution and assign a moderate access control level.

Here is my decision:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

Please note that this is a rough estimate and may need to be adjusted based on further analysis or additional information about the method.
