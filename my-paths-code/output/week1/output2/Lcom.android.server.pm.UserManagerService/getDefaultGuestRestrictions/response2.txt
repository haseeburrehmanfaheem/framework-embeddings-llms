In the absence of similar APIs or ground truth to compare with, assigning an access control level requires a careful analysis of the method's potential impact on the system, user data, and security.

Given that no specific details about the new Android method are provided, I'll outline a general approach:

1. **NONE**: This level is typically assigned to methods that do not pose any risk to user privacy or system integrity. If the method does not access sensitive information, does not perform operations that could potentially harm the system, and its failure would not have significant consequences, it might be considered for "NONE".

2. **NORMAL**: Methods that require some level of access control but are generally safe when used appropriately fall into this category. They might access non-sensitive user data or perform actions that, while not dangerous, still need to be monitored.

3. **DANGEROUS**: This level is for methods that can pose significant risks if misused, such as accessing sensitive user information, performing operations that could harm the system, or handling financial transactions.

4. **SYS_OR_SIG**: This is typically reserved for system-level operations or those that require signature-level permissions, indicating a high level of trust and potential risk if abused.

Without specific details on what the method does, its potential risks, and how it interacts with sensitive data or system resources, making an informed decision is challenging.

However, since no information suggests this method poses a significant risk or requires elevated privileges based on typical Android development practices and without explicit details to the contrary, a cautious approach would lean towards:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice assumes the method likely interacts with some level of user data or system functionality that warrants monitoring but does not pose an immediate or significant threat. Adjustments should be made as more specific information about the method's behavior and requirements becomes available.
