To assign an access control level to the `isUserOfType` API, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `isUserOfType` checks if a user is of a specific type.
   - It first calls `checkQueryOrCreateUsersPermission("check user type")`, which then calls `hasQueryOrCreateUsersPermission()`.
   - This method checks for the `android.permission.QUERY_USERS` permission and also considers the caller's UID, indicating that it deals with potentially sensitive operations related to user management.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code points involve checking permissions (`checkQueryOrCreateUsersPermission`, `hasQueryOrCreateUsersPermission`) and accessing user information (`getUserTypeNoChecks`, `getUserInfoLU`).
   - These operations are related to managing or querying user data, which can be sensitive.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `getProfiles(IZ)Ljava/util/List;` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Another similar API `isUserNameSet(I)Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Both of these APIs involve operations that require system or signature-level permissions, indicating they handle sensitive data or actions.

Given the information and analysis:

- The `isUserOfType` method involves checking user types, which could be considered sensitive information.
- It requires permission checks (`android.permission.QUERY_USERS`) similar to the other APIs mentioned, which have been classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The operations involved (checking user type, accessing user info) suggest that this method should also be treated with a similar level of access control due to its potential impact on user data privacy and system integrity.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and the similarity with other APIs classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `isUserOfType` API should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
