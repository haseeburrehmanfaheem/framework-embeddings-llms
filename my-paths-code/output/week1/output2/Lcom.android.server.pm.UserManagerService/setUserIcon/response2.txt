In that case, I will rely on general guidelines for assigning access control levels to Android methods.

Since no similar APIs were found, I'll consider the following factors:

1. **Method's functionality**: Without knowing the exact method signature and functionality, it's challenging to determine the access control level.
2. **Potential risks**: If the method interacts with sensitive data, hardware components, or performs critical operations, it may require a higher access control level.
3. **Default behavior**: In the absence of specific information, a moderate approach is often applied.

Given these considerations, I would assign a default access control level of "NORMAL" to the original_method API, as it is a reasonable choice when there's no clear indication of high-risk functionality or sensitive data interaction.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

Please note that this assignment might need to be revised if more information about the method becomes available.
