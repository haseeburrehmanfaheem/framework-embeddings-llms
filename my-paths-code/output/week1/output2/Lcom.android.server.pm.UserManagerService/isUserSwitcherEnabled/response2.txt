In that case, I will rely on general principles to determine the access control level for the new android method.

Since no similar APIs are provided, I will consider the following factors:

1. **Method name and description**: Unfortunately, you haven't provided the method name and description. If you provide this information, I can make a more informed decision.
2. **Default access control level**: In the absence of any specific information, a default access control level of "NONE" or "NORMAL" is often assigned to new methods.

Assuming the method doesn't interact with sensitive data or perform critical operations, I would tentatively assign an access control level of "NORMAL".

Here's my response:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

Please provide more information about the method (e.g., its name, description, and any relevant context) if you'd like me to reassess the access control level.
