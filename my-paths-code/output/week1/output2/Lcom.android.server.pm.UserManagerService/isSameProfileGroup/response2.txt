To determine the access control level for the `isSameProfileGroup` method, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The `isSameProfileGroup` method checks if two user IDs belong to the same profile group. It first calls `checkQueryUsersPermission`, which in turn checks for the `QUERY_USERS` permission using `hasQueryUsersPermission`. This permission check is a crucial factor in determining the access control level.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getUserSerialNumber(I)I` with an access control level of `NONE`. However, this method does not perform any explicit permission checks within its provided code snippet, unlike `isSameProfileGroup`.

2. `getProfileParent(I)Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves getting a user's parent profile, which is a more sensitive operation and requires a higher level of access control.

Given the information:

- The `isSameProfileGroup` method performs a permission check for `QUERY_USERS`, indicating that it does handle potentially sensitive user information.
- The method's primary function is to compare two user IDs, which inherently involves accessing user data but does so in a manner that is controlled by the `QUERY_USERS` permission.

Considering these points and comparing them with the provided similar APIs:

- The `SYS_OR_SIG` level seems too restrictive for `isSameProfileGroup` because it doesn't deal with as sensitive an operation as getting a profile parent, which directly involves user hierarchy and potentially more sensitive information.
- The `NONE` level might seem appropriate at first glance due to the similarity in accessing user information, but given that `isSameProfileGroup` explicitly checks for the `QUERY_USERS` permission, it indicates a need for some level of access control.

However, since `isSameProfileGroup` does indeed check for the `QUERY_USERS` permission and deals with user data comparison rather than modification or sensitive detail retrieval (like in the case of `getProfileParent`), it leans more towards requiring a moderate level of access control. 

Given that the method checks for a specific permission (`QUERY_USERS`) which is not as sensitive as managing users but still involves querying them, and considering the options provided:

- `NONE` seems too lenient because there is an explicit permission check.
- `SYS_OR_SIG` seems too strict based on the comparison with similar APIs and the nature of the operation.
- `DANGEROUS` might be considered due to the involvement of user data, but given that it's a comparison operation and not a modification or direct access to sensitive details without proper checks, it might not fully align with the typical use of `DANGEROUS`.
- `NORMAL` seems most appropriate as it reflects the method's need for permission (`QUERY_USERS`) without escalating to the level of system or signature permissions required for more sensitive operations.

Therefore, considering the explicit permission check and the nature of the operation (comparing user IDs within a profile group), the access control level that best fits `isSameProfileGroup` is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice balances the need for some form of access control due to the handling of user data with the recognition that the operation itself (comparing profile groups) does not rise to the level of requiring system or signature-level permissions.
