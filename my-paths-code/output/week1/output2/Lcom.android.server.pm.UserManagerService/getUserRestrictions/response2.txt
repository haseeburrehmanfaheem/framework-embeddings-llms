To determine the access control level for the `getUserRestrictions` API, we need to consider its functionality, the permissions it checks, and how it compares to similar APIs with known access control levels.

The `getUserRestrictions` API is involved in managing user restrictions, which can be sensitive from a security and privacy perspective. It calls `checkManageOrInteractPermissionIfCallerInOtherProfileGroup`, indicating that it requires certain permissions to proceed, specifically checking for "android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS" or manage users permission.

Given the similar APIs provided:
- `setUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;ZI)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API is also involved in user restriction management but is focused on setting restrictions rather than retrieving them. The similarity in functionality and the need for system or signature-level permissions to modify user restrictions suggest a similar security requirement.
- `removeUserWhenPossible(IZ)I` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API's involvement in potentially sensitive operations like removing users, along with its interaction with user restriction management (calling `getUserRestrictions` and checking permissions), further supports the need for elevated access controls.

Considering these points:
- The `getUserRestrictions` method deals with sensitive information related to user restrictions.
- It checks for specific permissions (`android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` or manage users permission) before proceeding, indicating a level of security control.
- Similar APIs in terms of functionality and security implications have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getUserRestrictions` API should also be assigned an access control level that reflects its need for system or signature-level permissions to ensure it is used securely and appropriately.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
