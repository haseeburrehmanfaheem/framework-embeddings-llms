To determine the access control level for the `markGuestForDeletion` method, we must analyze its behavior, the sinks it interacts with, and compare it to similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `markGuestForDeletion` method involves several key operations:
1. It checks if the caller has manage users permission via `UserManagerService.checkManageUsersPermission("Only the system can remove users");`.
2. It retrieves user restrictions for the calling user.
3. It modifies a guest user's settings by setting `UserInfo.guestToRemove = 1` and updating the user's flags, then writes these changes.

Given these operations, let's consider the access control levels of similar APIs:
- `removeUser(I)Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method checks for create users permission and has a high similarity score with `markGuestForDeletion`.
- `removeUserEvenWhenDisallowed(I)Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, involves checking create users permission, and shows significant similarity to `markGuestForDeletion`.

Both similar APIs require system or signature-level permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG`) due to their ability to modify user settings, which is a sensitive operation. The primary difference between these methods and `markGuestForDeletion` lies in the specific permissions they check (create vs. manage users) and the exact nature of the user modifications. However, all these methods deal with critical system operations related to user management.

Considering the code paths provided for `markGuestForDeletion`, it's clear that this method also deals with sensitive user management operations, specifically targeting guest accounts. The method checks for manage users permission, which is a system-level operation, indicating that only privileged callers (those with system or signature-level permissions) should be able to perform such actions.

Given the similarities in functionality and the need for elevated permissions to perform these operations, it's reasonable to conclude that `markGuestForDeletion` should have a similar access control level to its counterparts.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the method's behavior, its interaction with sensitive system settings, and the comparison with similar APIs, the access control level for `markGuestForDeletion` should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination aligns with the principle that operations affecting system settings or user management require high-level permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.
