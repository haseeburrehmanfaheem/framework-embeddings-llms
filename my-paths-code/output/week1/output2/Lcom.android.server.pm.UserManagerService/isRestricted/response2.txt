In the absence of similar APIs to compare with, I'll need to rely on general principles of assigning access control levels.

Since no specific information about the API's functionality, potential risks, or interactions with sensitive resources is provided, it's challenging to determine a precise access control level. However, given that it's an Android method, here are some general considerations:

1. **NONE**: Typically assigned when an API does not pose any risk and doesn't interact with sensitive data or system resources.
2. **NORMAL**: Applies to APIs that might have some impact on the user experience or device functionality but do not access sensitive information directly.
3. **DANGEROUS**: Used for APIs that can potentially cause harm, access sensitive user data, or significantly affect system behavior if misused.
4. **SYS_OR_SIG**: Reserved for system-oriented or signal-level operations that require high privilege levels.

Without specific details about the API's functionality, a conservative approach would be to consider it as potentially accessing some level of system or user data. Thus, without evidence of significant risk or direct interaction with highly sensitive information, one might lean towards **NORMAL** as a default, assuming the method could affect device behavior or user experience in some way but lacks specifics that would categorize it as more risky.

Therefore, based on this reasoning and without further details:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

Please note, this is an educated guess due to the lack of specific information about the API's functionality. Actual access control should be determined by a thorough review of what the method does and how it interacts with system resources or user data.
