To determine the access control level for the `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method checks if the caller has the necessary permissions using `checkManageOrInteractPermissionIfCallerInOtherProfileGroup`. It then retrieves the user type details using `getUserTypeDetailsNoChecks` and checks if the user has a badge. If the user does not have a badge, it logs an error message. However, in one of the paths (path 3), if the user has a badge, it returns the badge no background resource ID.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- `getUserBadgeResId` and `getUserIconBadgeResId` both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. They also retrieve user type details using `getUserTypeDetailsNoChecks`, check if the user has a badge, and return a resource ID related to the badge.

Given the similarities in code and functionality, it's reasonable to conclude that `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` should have a similar access control level. The method interacts with sensitive user information (user type details and badges) and requires specific permissions to be executed, which aligns with the characteristics of methods labeled as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparison with similar APIs, the access control level for `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
