To determine the access control level for the `removeUser` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `removeUser` method has three paths, but all of them involve checking the `CREATE_USERS` permission using `UserManagerService.checkCreateUsersPermission("Only the system can remove users");`. This check is also present in the similar API `removeUserEvenWhenDisallowed(I)Z`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Additionally, the `removeUser` method interacts with user restrictions and removal restrictions, similar to the `removeUserWhenPossible(IZ)I` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippets of these similar APIs show that they all deal with sensitive user management operations that require system or signature-level permissions.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeUser` method should have a similar access control level, as it performs operations that are restricted to system or signature-level permissions.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity in code snippets and the sensitive nature of user management operations performed by the `removeUser` method, which aligns with the access control levels of the provided similar APIs.
