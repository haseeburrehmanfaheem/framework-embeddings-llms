To determine the access control level for the `isUserRunning` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `isUserRunning` method checks if a user is running by calling `checkManageOrInteractPermissionIfCallerInOtherProfileGroup` and then accessing the `mLocalService.isUserRunning` method. The `checkManageOrInteractPermissionIfCallerInOtherProfileGroup` method checks for manage or interact permissions across users.

The similar APIs provided, `isUserUnlocked` and `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also access the `mUserStates` field of `UserManagerService`, which is similar to the `isUserRunning` method.

Given that the `isUserRunning` method checks for permissions and accesses sensitive user information, it is likely that it requires a similar access control level as the similar APIs. The fact that it interacts with the same sinks (e.g., `mUserStates`) as the similar APIs further supports this conclusion.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `isUserRunning` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is informed by the similarities between the `isUserRunning` method and the provided similar APIs, as well as the need for permission checks and access control when interacting with sensitive user information.
