Since no similar APIs were found, I will rely on general guidelines for assigning access control levels to Android methods.

Given that I don't have any information about the method's behavior, parameters, or return values, I will make a conservative assumption. If the method is new and doesn't resemble any existing APIs, it's possible that it may interact with sensitive data or system resources.

In this case, I would assign an access control level of "NORMAL" by default, as it's a reasonable starting point for most Android methods. However, please note that this is a tentative assignment and may need to be revised if more information about the method becomes available.

Here is the assigned access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

If you provide more context or details about the method's behavior, I can reevaluate and adjust the access control level accordingly.
