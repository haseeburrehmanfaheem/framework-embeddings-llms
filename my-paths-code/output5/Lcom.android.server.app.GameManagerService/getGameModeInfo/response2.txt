Based on the provided information, I will analyze the API and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `getGameModeInfo` API has a similarity score of 0.9637267589569092 with two other APIs, `getGameMode(Ljava/lang/String;I)I`, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These similar APIs interact with the same sinks, such as `getApplicationInfoAsUser`, `containsKey`, and `getAvailableGameModesBitfield`.

The `getGameModeInfo` API also uses similar logic to retrieve game mode information, including checking the application's category, retrieving settings, and getting available game modes. The API returns a `GameModeInfo` object, which is similar to the return type of the similar APIs.

Considering the similarities in code structure, sink interactions, and logic, I conclude that the `getGameModeInfo` API should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, similar to its counterparts.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
