To determine the access control level for the `createSearchSession` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `createSearchSession` method has two paths, but both of them involve creating a new instance of `SearchUiManagerService$SearchUiManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` and calling its `accept` method. This is similar to the code in the provided similar APIs, which also create instances of lambda classes and call their `accept` methods.

The similar APIs, `query` and `notifyEvent`, have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the `createSearchSession` method may also have a similar access control level, as it shares similarities with these APIs in terms of code structure and functionality.

Furthermore, the `createSearchSession` method does not appear to perform any sensitive operations or interact with sensitive data that would require a higher access control level, such as `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `createSearchSession` method should be `NONE`, similar to the provided similar APIs.
