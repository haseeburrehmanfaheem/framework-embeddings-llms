To assign an access control level to the `destroySearchSession` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `destroySearchSession` method has two paths, both of which involve the following operations:

1. Creating a new instance of `SearchUiManagerService$SearchUiManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda2` with the provided `SearchSessionId`.
2. Handling incoming user information using `ActivityManagerInternal`.
3. Checking if the user is temporary using `ServiceNameResolver`.
4. If the user is not temporary, it checks if the caller is recents using `ActivityTaskManagerInternal`. If not, it proceeds to call the `accept` method on the lambda instance.
5. The `accept` method is called on an instance of `AbstractPerUserSystemService`, which is obtained from `this.this$0.getServiceForUserLocked(v9)`.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `query(Landroid/app/search/SearchSessionId;Landroid/app/search/Query;Landroid/app/search/ISearchCallback;)V` has a similarity score of 0.8156088590621948 and an access control level of NONE.
* `notifyEvent(Landroid/app/search/SearchSessionId;Landroid/app/search/Query;Landroid/app/search/SearchTargetEvent;)V` has a similarity score of 0.811592161655426 and an access control level of NONE.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, indicating that they do not require any special permissions or access control checks.

However, the `destroySearchSession` method involves handling user information and checking if the caller is recents, which may indicate a need for some level of access control. Nevertheless, considering the similarity with other APIs and the fact that it does not perform any sensitive operations, we can conclude that the access control level for `destroySearchSession` should be NONE.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
