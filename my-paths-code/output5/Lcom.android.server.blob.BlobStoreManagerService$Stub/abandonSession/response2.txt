To determine the access control level for the `abandonSession` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `abandonSession` method takes two parameters, a session ID (`long p1`) and a package name (`String p2`). It first checks if the session ID is positive and if the package name is not null. Then, it opens an internal blob store session using `BlobStoreManagerService.openSessionInternal(p2, p3, p4)`, where `p3` and `p4` are not defined in the given snippet but seem to be part of the method's parameters or class variables. After opening the session, it abandons the session using `v15.abandon()`. If a certain logging condition is met (`BlobStoreConfig.LOGV == 0`), it writes blob sessions asynchronously.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `openSession` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves getting user sessions locked, checking access, and opening a session.
   - The `createSession` method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It generates a new session ID, creates a new blob store session, adds the session for a specific user, and writes blob sessions asynchronously if needed.

3. **Access Control Determination**: Given that both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level and considering the operations performed by `abandonSession`, such as opening and then abandoning a session which seems to involve system-level or signature-protected actions (given the involvement of `Binder.getCallingUid()` which is typically used to check the UID of the calling process, implying some level of permission checking), we can infer that `abandonSession` likely requires a similar level of access control.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the operations and comparisons with other APIs, the `abandonSession` method should have an access control level that reflects its need for system-level or signature-protected permissions to manage blob store sessions securely.

The final answer is: 
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
