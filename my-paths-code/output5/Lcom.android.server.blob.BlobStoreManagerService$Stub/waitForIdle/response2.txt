To assign an access control level to the `waitForIdle` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs. 

The `waitForIdle` method posts a callback to a handler using the `post` method, which is a common operation in Android development. The similar APIs provided, `unregisterSmartspaceUpdates` and `registerSmartspaceUpdates`, also involve posting callbacks or accepting them.

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that they are system-internal or signature-protected methods, likely requiring specific permissions or signatures to be called.

Given the similarity in operation (posting a callback) and considering that `waitForIdle` does not seem to involve any sensitive operations that would warrant a `DANGEROUS` access control level (such as accessing user data, making network requests, etc.), it's reasonable to infer that `waitForIdle` might also require system or signature-level access. This is because the method interacts with internal components (`Handler`, `RemoteCallback`) in a manner similar to how the other two methods interact with their respective callbacks.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons, the most appropriate access control level for the `waitForIdle` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
