To determine the access control level for the `queryBlobsForUser` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - The method has two paths, both of which involve checking if the input `p1` is not equal to `-2`. If this condition is met, it proceeds to interact with `ActivityManagerInternal` (to check for special users) and then uses lambda expressions to iterate over blobs using `BlobStoreManagerService.forEachBlobLocked`.
   - The key elements here are the interaction with system services (`ActivityManagerInternal`) and the iteration over blobs, which suggests handling of potentially sensitive data or system resources.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The provided similar APIs, `getLeasedBlobs`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations involving blob management within this context are considered sensitive enough to require either system or signature-level permissions.
   - The similarity scores (0.9632422924041748 and 0.9605683088302612) indicate a high degree of similarity between these APIs and the method in question, suggesting that their access control levels could be applicable.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given the similarities in code structure and functionality with the `getLeasedBlobs` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that `queryBlobsForUser` should have a similar access control level.
   - The method's interaction with system services and handling of potentially sensitive data (blobs) further supports this decision.

Based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `queryBlobsForUser` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination reflects the method's involvement in system-level operations and its similarity to other APIs that are subject to the same access control restrictions.
