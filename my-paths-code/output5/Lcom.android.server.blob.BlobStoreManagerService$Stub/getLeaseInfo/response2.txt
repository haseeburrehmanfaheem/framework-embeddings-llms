After analyzing the provided information, I have determined that the `getLeaseInfo` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Here's why:

1. **Similarity with other APIs**: The `getLeaseInfo` method has a high similarity score with two other APIs: `openBlob` and `acquireLease`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `getLeaseInfo` method is likely to require similar access controls.
2. **Sink code analysis**: The sink code provided shows that the `getLeaseInfo` method accesses the `mBlobsMap` object and calls the `isAccessAllowedForCaller` method, which is similar to the code in the `openBlob` and `acquireLease` APIs. This suggests that the `getLeaseInfo` method is performing a similar access control check.
3. **Method semantics**: The `getLeaseInfo` method appears to be retrieving information about a lease, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper access controls. The method's name and parameters suggest that it is intended to provide information about a lease, rather than modifying it or performing any other sensitive operation.

Based on these factors, I conclude that the `getLeaseInfo` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which is consistent with the access control levels of similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
