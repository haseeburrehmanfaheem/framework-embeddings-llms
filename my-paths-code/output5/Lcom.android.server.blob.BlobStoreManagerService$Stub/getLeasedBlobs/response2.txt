To determine the access control level for the `getLeasedBlobs` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getLeasedBlobs` method takes a `String` parameter `p1`, which is checked for nullability using `Objects.requireNonNull`. This ensures that the method does not proceed with a null package name, indicating some level of input validation. It then retrieves the calling UID via `Binder.getCallingUid()` and initializes an empty `ArrayList` to store leased blobs. The method uses a lambda function (`BlobStoreManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda13`) in conjunction with `BlobStoreManagerService.forEachBlobLocked` to populate the list of leased blobs based on certain conditions not explicitly shown in the snippet.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs, `queryBlobsForUser`, have a high similarity score (0.9632422924041748 and 0.9605683088302612) with `getLeasedBlobs`. This suggests that their functionalities and implementations are closely related to `getLeasedBlobs`.
   - These APIs are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permission to be invoked, likely due to the sensitive nature of querying blobs for a specific user.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The primary difference between `getLeasedBlobs` and `queryBlobsForUser` lies in their parameters and possibly the conditions used within the lambda functions. However, all methods interact with blob management services, suggesting they operate on sensitive data or functionalities that require restricted access.
   - The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` in `getLeasedBlobs` implies a check for the caller's identity, which is a common practice when enforcing access control based on user or process identity.

Given these considerations, it seems reasonable to infer that `getLeasedBlobs`, like its similar APIs, handles sensitive operations related to blob management. Therefore, assigning an access control level that ensures only authorized (system or signature-level) entities can invoke this method is prudent to maintain system security and integrity.

**Access Control Level**: Given the similarities with other methods requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions and considering the method's interaction with potentially sensitive data (leased blobs), it's logical to assign a similar access control level to `getLeasedBlobs`.
