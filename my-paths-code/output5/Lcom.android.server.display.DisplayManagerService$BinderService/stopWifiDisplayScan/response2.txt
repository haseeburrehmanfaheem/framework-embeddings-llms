To determine the access control level for the `stopWifiDisplayScan` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method checks if `v7` (retrieved from `this.mCallbacks.get(p2)`) is null before calling `DisplayManagerService.stopWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)`. This suggests that it interacts with system-level services related to WiFi display management, which might require specific permissions or access levels.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **startWifiDisplayScan()V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9560672044754028) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The high similarity suggests that both methods likely operate within the same security context, interacting with system-level components for WiFi display management.
   - **disconnectWifiDisplay()V**: Although this method has a lower similarity score (0.7346751689910889) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`, its operation seems to be more straightforward (requesting disconnection) without the need for elevated permissions or system-level checks as seen in `stopWifiDisplayScan`.

3. **Semantics and Access Control**:
   - The method's interaction with `Binder` for getting the calling PID and clearing/restore the calling identity implies a level of system interaction that typically requires more than basic permissions.
   - The operation on WiFi display scans suggests it affects system resources or settings, which often require higher access control levels to prevent unauthorized changes.

Given these considerations:

- **Similarity with startWifiDisplayScan()V** and its `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests a similar security requirement due to their high similarity in functionality and likely impact on the system.
- The method's system-level interactions (e.g., using `Binder`, managing WiFi display scans) imply that it should not be accessible without proper authorization or system-level permissions.

Therefore, considering the need for system-level access control for managing WiFi display scans and the similarity with `startWifiDisplayScan()V`, the appropriate access control level for `stopWifiDisplayScan` is likely `SYS_OR_SIG`.
