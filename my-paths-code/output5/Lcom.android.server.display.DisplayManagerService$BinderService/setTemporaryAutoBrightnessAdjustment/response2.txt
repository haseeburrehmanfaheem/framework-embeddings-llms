To assign an access control level to the `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` takes a float parameter `p1`, which represents an auto-brightness adjustment value.
   - It interacts with `DisplayManagerService$SyncRoot` and `SparseArray` of display power controllers, indicating it deals with display settings.
   - The critical part involves sending a message to a handler (`this.mHandler`) with the obtained float value converted to an integer. This suggests it's influencing how brightness is adjusted temporarily.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code specifically focuses on converting the float parameter `p1` to an integer and then sending this value as part of a message to a handler.
   - This implies that the security concern here could be related to how this temporary adjustment might affect system resources or user experience, but it does not directly indicate a severe security risk like data leakage or privilege escalation.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setTemporaryBrightness(IF)V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9914495348930359) with `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment`. It also deals with brightness adjustments and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions.
   - **reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock(ZI)V**: With a lower similarity score (0.846314013004303), this API is less similar but still relevant for understanding the context of handler message sending. It has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting its operation might not be as sensitive or security-critical.

Given these points, we can deduce that:
- The method directly influences system settings (display brightness) which could have implications on device performance and user experience.
- The high similarity with `setTemporaryBrightness(IF)V`, which requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, suggests that `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` might also require a similar level of protection to prevent unauthorized modifications to the display settings.

However, considering the specific operation (temporary auto-brightness adjustment) and comparing it with other provided APIs, we need to weigh the potential impact on system security and functionality. Since this method does interact closely with system resources (display settings), but does not directly imply a severe security risk like data exposure or significant privilege escalation, its access control might lean towards requiring some level of permission.

Given the information:
- The most similar API (`setTemporaryBrightness`) has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests a need for either system-level or signature-level permissions to modify such settings.
- Considering the method's functionality and its interaction with system resources, it seems reasonable that modifying auto-brightness settings temporarily could require some form of permission to prevent misuse.

Thus, considering all factors, the final access control level for `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` would likely be aligned with system or signature-level permissions due to its impact on device settings and similarity with other APIs requiring such permissions.

**Final Access Control Level:**
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
This choice reflects the method's influence on system settings and its similarity with other methods that require `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions, aiming to balance functionality with security considerations.
