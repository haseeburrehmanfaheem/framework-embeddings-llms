To determine the access control level for the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method simply returns the value of `this.mUserDisabledHdrTypes`, which suggests it's accessing a field within its class. There's no evident modification or sensitive operation being performed that would require elevated permissions.

2. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - **areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z**: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and similarly just returns the value of a boolean field (`this.mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`). The high similarity score (0.87247633934021) indicates that `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` shares a lot in common with this API in terms of functionality.
   - **setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests it requires system or signature-level permission because it modifies settings. Although the similarity score (0.732030987739563) is lower compared to `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z`, it's still relevant for understanding that modifications to related settings require higher permissions.

Given this analysis, since `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` only returns a value without modifying any settings or performing sensitive operations, its behavior aligns more closely with `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z`. Therefore, the access control level for `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` should be similar to that of `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z`, which is `NONE`.
