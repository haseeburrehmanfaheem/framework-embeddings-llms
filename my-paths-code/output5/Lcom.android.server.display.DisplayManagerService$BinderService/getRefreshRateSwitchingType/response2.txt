To determine the access control level for the `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` method appears to retrieve and return the refresh rate switching type of a device or display. It does so by accessing an internal variable `mModeSwitchingType`, which suggests it is dealing with display or graphics settings.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet indicates that the critical operation within this method is the retrieval and return of `this.mModeSwitchingType`. This implies that the sensitivity of the data or the potential impact of accessing/changing this setting could influence its access control level.

3. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The similar API, `notifyGraphicsEnvironmentSetup`, has a similarity score of 0.728627622127533 with `getRefreshRateSwitchingType`. This suggests that while they are not identical, they share significant similarities, possibly in their operational context or the type of data they handle.
   - The access control level for `notifyGraphicsEnvironmentSetup` is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission. This implies that the API deals with sensitive operations or data that could impact system performance, security, or user experience.

Given these points:

- **Access Control Decision**: 
  - Since `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` deals with graphics/display settings and has a similar operational context to an API requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` permission, it's reasonable to infer that accessing or modifying display settings could have system-wide implications or require privileged access.
  - The method does not seem to perform any dangerous operations like changing system settings directly but rather reads a current setting, which might not necessarily require `DANGEROUS` permission. However, considering the similarity with an API requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` and the potential for this information to be used in a context that could affect system performance or security (e.g., optimizing graphics settings), assigning a lower access control level like `NONE` or `NORMAL` might not be appropriate.

**Final Access Control Level**: Considering the above analysis, especially the similarity with an API that requires `SYS_OR_SIG` permission and the nature of the data it handles, the most suitable access control level for `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects its potential to deal with system-sensitive settings or information.
