To determine the access control level for the `releaseVirtualDisplay` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, similar APIs, and their assigned access control levels.

The provided code snippets for `releaseVirtualDisplay` show that it interacts with a virtual display adapter to release a virtual display. The critical part of this interaction is the call to `this.mVirtualDisplayAdapter.releaseVirtualDisplayLocked(p2)`, which suggests an operation on a display device managed by the system.

Looking at the similar APIs:

1. **setVirtualDisplayState**: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and interacts with the virtual display adapter to set its state.
2. **resizeVirtualDisplay**: Similarly, this method also has an access control level of `NONE` and is used to resize a virtual display.

Both similar APIs have `NONE` as their access control level, indicating that they do not require special permissions or access controls beyond what is normally required for such operations within the system's display management functionality.

Given the context of these methods and considering the nature of the operation performed by `releaseVirtualDisplay`, it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level. The method does not appear to perform any actions that would typically be classified as dangerous or requiring special system or signature permissions, such as accessing sensitive user data, making financial transactions, or altering system settings in a way that could introduce security risks.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its operation, the access control level for `releaseVirtualDisplay` should also be `NONE`, indicating it does not pose significant risks or require elevated permissions to perform its intended function.
