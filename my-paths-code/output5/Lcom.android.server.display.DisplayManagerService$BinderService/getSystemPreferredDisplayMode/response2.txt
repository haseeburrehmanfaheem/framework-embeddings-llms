To determine the access control level for the `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` method, we need to analyze its code snippets, sink codes, and compare them with similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippets Analysis**:
   - The method involves getting a display mode based on the system's preference for a given display identifier (`p1`).
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)` to manage the calling identity, which is a common pattern in Android for temporarily changing the thread's calling identity. This suggests that the method might be interacting with system-level resources or services.
   - The logic involves retrieving a `LogicalDisplay` object and then a `DisplayDevice` object to finally get the system-preferred display mode.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink codes provided show the critical paths of the method, focusing on how it retrieves and returns the display mode. This involves interactions with `LogicalDisplay` and `DisplayDevice` objects.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `getUserPreferredDisplayMode(I)Landroid/view/Display$Mode;` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method also interacts with display settings but focuses on user preferences rather than system preferences.
   - The similarity in code structure and the fact that both methods deal with display modes suggest that they might have similar access control requirements.

Given these points, assigning an access control level to `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` involves considering the sensitivity of the operation it performs. Retrieving the system-preferred display mode does not inherently seem to pose a significant risk or require high-level permissions, as it's more about querying a setting rather than modifying sensitive data or performing an action that could impact the system's security or privacy.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of the operation (retrieving a system preference), it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
