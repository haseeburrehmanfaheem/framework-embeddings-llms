To determine the access control level for the `disconnectWifiDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `connectWifiDisplay` and `forgetWifiDisplay` methods have a high similarity score with `disconnectWifiDisplay`, indicating they share similar functionality or are part of the same API family.
   - Both `connectWifiDisplay` and `forgetWifiDisplay` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to WiFi displays, such as connecting, forgetting, and potentially disconnecting, are considered system or signature protected. These levels typically imply that the method can only be called by system components or applications signed with the same certificate as the application defining the method.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code `this.mWifiDisplayAdapter.requestDisconnectLocked();` is similar in structure and purpose to the codes in the similar APIs (`this.mWifiDisplayAdapter.requestConnectLocked(p1);` and `this.mWifiDisplayAdapter.requestForgetLocked(p1);`). This similarity indicates that these methods interact with the WiFi display adapter in a manner that requires protection, likely because they affect system resources or settings.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the similarities in functionality and the access control levels of related APIs (`SYS_OR_SIG` for both `connectWifiDisplay` and `forgetWifiDisplay`), it is reasonable to infer that `disconnectWifiDisplay` should also have a similar level of protection.
   - The method's interaction with system resources (WiFi display adapter) and its ability to alter the device's state (by disconnecting a WiFi display) support the need for a higher access control level than `NONE` or `NORMAL`.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `disconnectWifiDisplay` method is `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the protection levels of similar methods that interact with WiFi displays and reflects the potential system impact of disconnecting such a display.
