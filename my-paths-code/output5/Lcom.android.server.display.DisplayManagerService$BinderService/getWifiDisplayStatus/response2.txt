To assign an access control level to the `getWifiDisplayStatus` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with similar structures, both involving clearing and restoring the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)`. This suggests that the method is sensitive to the caller's identity, which is a common pattern for methods that require certain permissions or access levels.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show how `WifiDisplayStatus` objects are created or retrieved. In one path, it retrieves the status from `this.mWifiDisplayAdapter.getWifiDisplayStatusLocked()`, and in the other, it creates a new `WifiDisplayStatus` object directly. Both paths return this status, suggesting that the method's primary purpose is to provide information about the WiFi display status.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **pauseWifiDisplay()V**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions. Its code involves requesting a pause on the WiFi display adapter, which implies a level of control over system resources.
   - **stopWifiDisplayScan()V**: Also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method stops scanning for WiFi displays. Like `pauseWifiDisplay()V`, it interacts with system-level functionality related to WiFi displays.

Given these points:

- The `getWifiDisplayStatus` method itself does not modify system state but rather retrieves information about the current status of WiFi displays.
- The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)` suggests a concern for the caller's identity, which is often associated with methods requiring some level of permission.
- However, unlike `pauseWifiDisplay()V` and `stopWifiDisplayScan()V`, `getWifiDisplayStatus` does not control or alter system resources directly. It's primarily an informational method.

Considering these factors, while `getWifiDisplayStatus` might require some form of access control due to its interaction with system-level information (WiFi display status), it does not appear to necessitate the same level of permission as methods that actively modify system state (`pauseWifiDisplay()V` and `stopWifiDisplayScan()V`). Therefore, a reasonable assignment would be `NORMAL`, reflecting that it requires some access control but not to the extent of system or signature-level permissions.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
