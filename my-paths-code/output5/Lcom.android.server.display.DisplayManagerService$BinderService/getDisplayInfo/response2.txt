Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getDisplayInfo` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `getDisplayInfo` method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them interact with the same sinks: `LogicalDisplay`, `DisplayEventReceiver$FrameRateOverride`, and `DisplayInfo`. The method checks if the display is present and has access to the frame rate override, and then returns the `DisplayInfo` object.

The similar APIs, `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` and `getUserPreferredDisplayMode`, have an access control level of `NONE`. They also interact with the `LogicalDisplay` sink, but they do not perform any additional checks or operations that would require a higher access control level.

Considering the semantics of the `getDisplayInfo` method and its similar APIs, it appears that the method is primarily retrieving information about the display and does not perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated access control. The checks for display presence and access to frame rate override are likely intended to ensure that the method returns accurate and relevant information, rather than to enforce strict access controls.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude that the `getDisplayInfo` method should have an access control level of `NONE`, similar to its similar APIs.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
