To assign an access control level to the `getDisplayDecorationSupport` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the sinks it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Behavior Analysis**: The `getDisplayDecorationSupport` method clears the calling identity, retrieves a display token using `DisplayManagerService.getDisplayToken(p2)`, and if successful, it attempts to get display decoration support from `SurfaceControl`. This process involves interaction with system services (`DisplayManagerService`) and low-level graphics operations (`SurfaceControl`). The clearing and restoring of calling identity suggest an attempt to perform actions without attributing them directly to the caller, which is a common pattern when interacting with sensitive system components.

2. **Sink Analysis**: The sinks in this method include `DisplayManagerService.getDisplayToken(p2)` and `SurfaceControl.getDisplayDecorationSupport(v4)`. These are related to display management and surface control, which are system-level operations that require specific permissions or access rights.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API provided is `setVirtualDisplaySurface`, with an access control level of `NONE`. However, this method directly interacts with a virtual display callback and sets a surface, which seems to have different security implications compared to getting decoration support for a display.
   
4. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that the `getDisplayDecorationSupport` method interacts with system-level services like `DisplayManagerService` and `SurfaceControl`, and considering it clears the calling identity (which might imply an operation that needs to bypass normal permission checks), we should consider if this requires specific access control.
   - However, since it does not directly manipulate sensitive data or perform actions typically classified as dangerous (e.g., sending SMS, making calls, accessing location), but rather deals with display settings which are somewhat restricted but not as critical, the `DANGEROUS` classification might be too severe unless these operations can lead to significant security breaches or privacy violations.
   - The method doesn't seem to fit perfectly into `SYS_OR_SIG` because it's more about getting a specific support status rather than signaling or system-level operations that require signature permissions.
   - Given the context and comparisons, `NORMAL` seems like an appropriate choice. This is because while it interacts with system components, these interactions are not typically classified as dangerous from a security perspective (like accessing contacts, location, etc.), nor do they seem to fit into the `SYS_OR_SIG` category which often involves more critical system operations or signaling.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and comparison, assigning an access control level of `NORMAL` seems appropriate for the `getDisplayDecorationSupport` method. This decision reflects its interaction with system services without directly engaging in dangerous operations or requiring signature-level permissions.
