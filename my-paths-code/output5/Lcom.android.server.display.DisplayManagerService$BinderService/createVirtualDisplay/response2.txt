To determine the access control level for the `createVirtualDisplay` method, we should consider its functionality and how it compares to the similar APIs provided, namely `resizeVirtualDisplay` and `setVirtualDisplaySurface`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`.

The `createVirtualDisplay` method is used to create a virtual display, which can be considered a sensitive operation as it involves creating a new display that could potentially be used to capture or manipulate screen data. However, the provided similar APIs (`resizeVirtualDisplay` and `setVirtualDisplaySurface`) suggest that operations related to virtual displays are not necessarily restricted to high access control levels, as they both have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given this context, we should consider what `createVirtualDisplay` does in relation to system security and privacy:

1. **Sensitivity of Operation**: Creating a virtual display could be seen as a sensitive operation because it might involve accessing or manipulating display data. However, the fact that similar operations (`resizeVirtualDisplay` and `setVirtualDisplaySurface`) are classified as `NONE` suggests that this sensitivity might not necessarily translate to a higher access control level in this context.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**: Both `resizeVirtualDisplay` and `setVirtualDisplaySurface` have an access control level of `NONE`. This indicates that operations related to the management of virtual displays are not inherently restricted to high-security levels, at least not based on the provided examples.

3. **Potential Impact on System Security or Privacy**: While creating a virtual display could potentially impact system security or privacy (e.g., by capturing screen data), the classification of similar APIs suggests that such operations are not automatically considered dangerous or requiring special permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS`) solely based on their interaction with virtual displays.

Considering these points, and given that both provided similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it seems reasonable to conclude that the `createVirtualDisplay` method would also be classified as having an access control level of `NONE`. This is because its functionality, while potentially sensitive, aligns with other virtual display management operations that do not require elevated access control levels.

**Access Control Level Decision:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the comparison with similar APIs and considering the nature of the operation performed by `createVirtualDisplay`. It reflects an understanding that while virtual display operations might involve some level of system interaction, they are not inherently classified as dangerous or requiring special system or signature permissions in this context.
