To assign an access control level to the `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - The method modifies a setting related to HDR types allowed by the user (`mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`).
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` to manage caller identity, which suggests it's handling sensitive operations that require permissions.
   - It interacts with `Settings$Global.putInt` to update system settings, specifically `"are_user_disabled_hdr_formats_allowed"`.
   - The method also iterates over displays using `this.mLogicalDisplayMapper.forEachLocked(v9)`, which could imply a need for certain privileges.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs (`setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These APIs also deal with settings related to HDR types and interact with system settings through `Settings$Global`.
   - They perform operations that could affect the system's display capabilities, which typically require significant permissions.

Given these points:

- The method interacts with system settings.
- It influences display capabilities.
- Similar methods have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their impact on system settings and display functionality.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's interaction with system settings (`Settings$Global.putInt`) and its influence on display capabilities, along with the similarity in access control levels of related APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This is because such operations typically require either system or signature-level permissions to ensure they are performed securely and with proper authorization.
