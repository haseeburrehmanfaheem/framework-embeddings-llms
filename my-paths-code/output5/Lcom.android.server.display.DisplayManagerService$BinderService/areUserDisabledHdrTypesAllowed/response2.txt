To determine the access control level for the `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar API 1: `getUserDisabledHdrTypes()[I`**
   - This method has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - Its code simply returns a value from `this.mUserDisabledHdrTypes`, which suggests it is reading data without any significant security implications.
   - The high similarity score (0.87247633934021) indicates that the behavior and functionality of this API are closely related to `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`.

2. **Similar API 2: `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V`**
   - This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Its code modifies a setting (`this.mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`) and interacts with system settings (`Settings$Global.putInt`), which implies it can affect the system's behavior or security.
   - The similarity score (0.8581590056419373) is also high, indicating that while the method's purpose differs (setting vs. getting), its domain and impact are related to `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`.

Given these observations:

- **Access Control Decision for `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`:**
  - The method simply returns a boolean value indicating whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed, without modifying any system settings or sensitive data.
  - Its behavior is more akin to `getUserDisabledHdrTypes()[I` in terms of reading and returning a value rather than setting or modifying system settings like `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V`.
  - Since it does not modify system settings or access sensitive information that could pose a security risk, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's functionality being similar to other APIs classified as `NONE` and not posing significant security risks or modifications to system settings.
