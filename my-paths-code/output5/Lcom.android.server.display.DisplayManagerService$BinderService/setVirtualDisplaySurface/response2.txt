To assign an access control level to the `setVirtualDisplaySurface` method, we should consider the similarities with other provided APIs, their access control levels, and how they interact with sinks.

1. **Similarity Analysis**: The `setVirtualDisplaySurface` method has a high similarity score with `setVirtualDisplayState` (0.812437117099762) and `resizeVirtualDisplay` (0.8039339780807495). Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

2. **Interaction with Sinks**: The sink code provided for `setVirtualDisplaySurface` involves interaction with `this.mVirtualDisplayAdapter.setVirtualDisplaySurfaceLocked(p2, p3);`, which is similar to how the other two APIs interact with their respective locked methods (`setVirtualDisplayStateLocked` and `resizeVirtualDisplayLocked`). This suggests that the nature of access control might be consistent across these methods given their similarities in interaction patterns.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**: 
    - The `NONE` access control level typically implies that the method does not pose significant risks or handle sensitive data directly, suggesting it doesn't require special permissions to execute.
    - Given the similarity in functionality and interaction with sinks between `setVirtualDisplaySurface` and the other two APIs (`setVirtualDisplayState` and `resizeVirtualDisplay`), and considering all have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to infer that `setVirtualDisplaySurface` also does not handle sensitive data or pose significant risks that would necessitate a higher access control level.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the similarities with other APIs, their assigned access control levels, and the nature of interaction with sinks, `setVirtualDisplaySurface` should logically have an access control level consistent with its peers.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
