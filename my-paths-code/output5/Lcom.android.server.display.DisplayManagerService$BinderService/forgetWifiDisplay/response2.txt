To determine the access control level for the `forgetWifiDisplay` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the behavior of similar APIs, and how they interact with the same sinks.

1. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The `forgetWifiDisplay` method takes a `String` parameter `p1`, which is supposed to be the name or identifier of the WiFi display to forget.
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` to manage its interactions, possibly to temporarily change the identity of the calling process for security reasons. This indicates some level of interaction with system-level functionalities that require careful access control.
   - The method then checks if `this.mWifiDisplayAdapter` is not equal to 0 (or null) and calls `requestForgetLocked(p2)` on it, which seems to be a mistake in the provided code since `p1` was the parameter passed into the function. However, based on context, we can infer that `p1` should be used.

2. **Sink Analysis**:
   - The sink is `this.mWifiDisplayAdapter.requestForgetLocked(p1);`, which implies an action to forget a WiFi display. Forgetting a WiFi display could potentially have security implications or impact system functionality, as it involves changing the state of network connections.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **disconnectWifiDisplay()V**: This method has a similarity score of 0.779 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It calls `this.mWifiDisplayAdapter.requestDisconnectLocked();`, which suggests a direct action on the WiFi display adapter without additional security checks or identity management.
   - **pauseWifiDisplay()V**: With a similarity score of 0.771, it's assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also interacts with the WiFi display adapter but requires system or signature-level permissions, indicating that pausing a WiFi display is considered a more sensitive operation.

Given these observations:
- The `forgetWifiDisplay` method involves managing calling identities and directly affects system resources (WiFi displays), suggesting it needs a certain level of access control.
- Its similarity to other methods that interact with the WiFi display adapter indicates that while it may not require the highest level of permission (`SYS_OR_SIG`) like `pauseWifiDisplay`, it still deals with potentially sensitive operations.
- The method's direct interaction with system resources (forgetting a WiFi display) and its management of calling identities imply that it should have more than `NONE` access control to prevent unauthorized or malicious actions.

However, the exact parameter usage discrepancy (`p1` vs. `p2`) in the provided code snippet introduces confusion. Despite this, focusing on the method's overall behavior and comparisons with similar APIs:

**Conclusion**: Given its interaction with system-level resources, the temporary management of calling identities, and considering the access control levels of similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `forgetWifiDisplay` seems to be `NORMAL`. This reflects a balance between ensuring the method can perform its intended function (forgetting a WiFi display) while maintaining some level of security scrutiny.
