Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `DisplayManagerService.isSubsetOf`: This sink checks if the provided array is a subset of the HDR types.
2. `Arrays.sort`: This sink sorts the input array.
3. `Settings$Global.putString`: This sink writes a string value to the global settings.
4. `DisplayManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda5`: This sink is an anonymous lambda function that iterates over the logical display mapper.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V` with a similarity score of 0.9810978174209595 and access control level `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API sets a boolean value indicating whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed.
2. `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V` with a similarity score of 0.8673056364059448 and access control level `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also sets the same boolean value.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Considering the sinks interacted by the `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, it appears to modify system settings and iterate over display-related data. This requires a certain level of privilege, which is consistent with the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permissions to access, which is consistent with the similar APIs and the sinks interacted by the method.
