To determine the access control level for the `startWifiDisplayScan` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `startWifiDisplayScan` method involves getting a callback from `this.mCallbacks.get(p2)` and then calling `DisplayManagerService.startWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)`. This operation seems to be related to managing WiFi displays, which could potentially involve system-level operations or require specific permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet shows that the method checks if `v7` (the callback object) is null before proceeding to call `DisplayManagerService.startWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)`. This suggests a precaution against potential null pointer exceptions but doesn't directly indicate the required access control level.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `stopWifiDisplayScan()` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission. Its similarity score with `startWifiDisplayScan` is high (0.9560672044754028), suggesting these methods likely share similar security requirements due to their related functionality in managing WiFi displays.
   - The `pauseWifiDisplay()` method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although its similarity score with `startWifiDisplayScan` is lower (0.7281269431114197) compared to `stopWifiDisplayScan`, it still implies that operations related to WiFi display management might require elevated permissions.

Given these points, the `startWifiDisplayScan` method appears to be involved in system-level operations related to WiFi display management, similar to its counterpart `stopWifiDisplayScan` and another related method `pauseWifiDisplay`. Both of these methods have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that such operations are sensitive and require either system-level permissions or signature-level verification to ensure they are accessed securely.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippets, sink analysis, and the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `startWifiDisplayScan` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to maintain consistency in security posture for related WiFi display management operations.
