To determine the access control level for the `queryServiceStatus` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that interact with the same sinks.

The provided `queryServiceStatus` API has two paths with depth 2, but both paths share a common pattern of checking if the service is enabled and then performing operations related to updating service information, getting package manager details, and creating remote services. The critical parts of the code involve:

1. `assertCalledByPackageOwner(p2)`: This checks if the caller is the package owner, which implies that there's a form of access control in place.
2. Interactions with `AmbientContextManagerPerUserService` and `AppGlobals.getPackageManager()`: These suggest interactions with system-level services and package management, which can be sensitive operations.

The sink code provided highlights several key operations:
- Updating service information
- Getting service info from the package manager
- Creating a remote ambient context detection service

Given these points, let's consider the similar API provided for comparison:

- `registerObserverWithCallback`: This API has an access control level of `NORMAL`. Its code also checks if the caller is the package owner using `assertCalledByPackageOwner(p2)`, indicating a similar level of access control concern as in `queryServiceStatus`.

Considering these observations:
- Both APIs perform sensitive operations (e.g., service updates, package manager interactions).
- Both check for package ownership, suggesting a need for access control.
- The similarity score between the two APIs is relatively high (0.7242887616157532), indicating they share significant functionality or structural elements.

Given these similarities and the nature of the operations performed by `queryServiceStatus`, it seems reasonable to conclude that its access control level should be similar to that of `registerObserverWithCallback`, which is `NORMAL`.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }}$
