To determine the access control level for the `onGlobalActionsShown` method, let's analyze the information provided.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `onGlobalActionsShown` checks if `mGlobalActionListener` is not null (or 0) and then calls `onGlobalActionsShown()` on it. This indicates that the method is responsible for notifying a listener about an event related to global actions being shown.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet provided also shows that the crucial action taken by `onGlobalActionsShown` is calling `onGlobalActionsShown()` on its listener if it exists. This suggests that the security or privacy impact of this method depends on what `mGlobalActionListener` does when notified.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**: The similar API, `onGlobalActionsHidden()V`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This implies that operations related to global actions (in this case, hiding them) are considered significant enough to require either system or signature-level permission. Given the high similarity score between `onGlobalActionsShown` and `onGlobalActionsHidden`, it suggests that both methods deal with similarly sensitive operations.

Considering these points:
- The method's functionality is closely related to another method (`onGlobalActionsHidden`) that requires a high level of access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`).
- The operation (showing global actions) could potentially impact the system's UI or security, depending on how `mGlobalActionListener` responds to the notification.

Given these considerations and without explicit evidence that `onGlobalActionsShown` requires less stringent controls than `onGlobalActionsHidden`, it is reasonable to conclude that `onGlobalActionsShown` should have a similar access control level due to its similarity in functionality and potential impact on system operations or user experience.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
