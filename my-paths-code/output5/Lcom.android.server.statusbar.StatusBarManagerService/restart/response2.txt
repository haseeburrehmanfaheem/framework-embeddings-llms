To determine the access control level for the `restart` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `restart` method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `this.mHandler.post()`, which are also present in the similar APIs (`disableForUser` and `reportPerceptibleAsync`). These similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` suggests that the method is interacting with system-level components, and `this.mHandler.post()` implies that it's posting a message to a handler, which could potentially interact with sensitive system resources.

Given these similarities and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that the `restart` method should also have a similar access control level.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
