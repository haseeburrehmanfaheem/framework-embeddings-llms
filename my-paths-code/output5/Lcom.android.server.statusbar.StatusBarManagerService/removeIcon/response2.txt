To determine the access control level for the `removeIcon` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `removeIcon` method takes a `String` parameter `p1`, which is used to remove an icon from `this.mIcons`.
   - If `this.mBar` equals 0, it calls `removeIcon` on `this.mBar` with the same `p1` parameter. This suggests interaction with another component or system service (`this.mBar`) that might have its own access control restrictions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves removing an icon from `this.mIcons` and potentially calling `removeIcon` on `this.mBar`, which is consistent with the method's purpose.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setIconVisibility**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7931897640228271 with `removeIcon`. It sets the visibility of an icon based on a boolean parameter and interacts with `this.mBar` to set the icon, suggesting system or signature-level access control (SYS_OR_SIG) due to its potential impact on system UI elements.
   - **remTile**: With a similarity score of 0.751244068145752, this API removes a Quick Settings tile based on a `ComponentName`. Like `removeIcon`, it interacts with `this.mBar` under certain conditions and is also classified as SYS_OR_SIG.

Given the similarities in functionality and access control levels between these APIs (all interacting with system-level components like `this.mBar`), and considering that removing an icon could potentially affect the system's UI or behavior, we can infer that the `removeIcon` method should have a similar access control level to prevent unauthorized modifications to the system's state.

**Access Control Decision**:
Based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and similarities with other APIs (especially their interactions with system-level components and assigned access control levels), it is reasonable to conclude that `removeIcon` requires system or signature-level access control to ensure that only authorized components can modify icons, thus maintaining system integrity and security.
