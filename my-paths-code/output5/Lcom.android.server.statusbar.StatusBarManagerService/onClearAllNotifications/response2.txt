To determine the access control level for the `onClearAllNotifications` method, we should consider the following factors based on the provided information:

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The method has high similarity scores with `onNotificationClick` and `onNotificationError`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that `onClearAllNotifications` might also require a similar level of access control due to its similar functionality and interaction with the system.

2. **Interaction with Sinks**: The method interacts with sinks (e.g., `Binder.getCallingUid()`, `Binder.getCallingPid()`, and `this.mNotificationDelegate.onClearAll(v3, v4, p1);`) in a manner that is consistent with the other two APIs. This interaction implies that it deals with sensitive operations related to notifications and system-level identifiers (UID and PID), which typically require elevated permissions.

3. **Use of Binder and NotificationDelegate**: The use of `Binder` to get the calling UID and PID, followed by clearing and restoring the calling identity, indicates that this method is designed to perform actions on behalf of the caller but with considerations for security and permission checks. This pattern is typical for methods that need to ensure they are being called by authorized components.

4. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose a risk or require no special permissions.
   - `NORMAL`: Used for methods that require standard permissions but are not dangerous.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Applies to methods that can potentially cause harm if misused (e.g., accessing sensitive user data).
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-level operations or those requiring signature-level permissions, indicating a high level of trust and potential risk if abused.

Given these considerations, the `onClearAllNotifications` method appears to handle system-level notification operations with sensitivity to the caller's identity. Its similarity in functionality and implementation details with other APIs that are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests it should be treated similarly due to its potential impact on system behavior and user experience.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the access control level for the `onClearAllNotifications` method should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This classification reflects the method's interaction with system-level components, its need to verify the caller's identity, and its similarity to other methods that are considered to require signature or system-level permissions.
