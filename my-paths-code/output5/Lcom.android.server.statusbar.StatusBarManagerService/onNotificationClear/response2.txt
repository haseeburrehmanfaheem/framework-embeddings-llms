To assign an access control level to the `onNotificationClear` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The `onNotificationClear` method has a high similarity score with two other APIs: 
- `onNotificationBubbleChanged` (similarity score: 0.8299651741981506) which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- `onNotificationActionClick` (similarity score: 0.8043651580810547) which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these similar APIs have the same access control level, `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

The `onNotificationClear` method interacts with the `mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationClear` sink, which suggests it is handling notification-related operations. The fact that it retrieves the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` implies that it is performing some form of authentication or authorization check.

Given these observations and considering the high similarity scores with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onNotificationClear` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
