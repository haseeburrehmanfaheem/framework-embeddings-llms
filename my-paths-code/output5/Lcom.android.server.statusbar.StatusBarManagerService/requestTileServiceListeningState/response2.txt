To determine the access control level for the `requestTileServiceListeningState` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `requestTileServiceListeningState` method interacts with the `ChangeIdStateQuery` class and the `PropertyInvalidatedCache` class. It also calls the `requestTileServiceListeningState` method on the `mBar` object if certain conditions are met.

The similar APIs provided, `collapsePanels()` and `clickTile()`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the `ChangeIdStateQuery` class and other internal objects.

Considering the similarities between these methods, it appears that they are all part of a system-level functionality that requires privileged access. The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` to retrieve the UID of the calling process and the interaction with internal classes like `PropertyInvalidatedCache` suggest that this method is also system-level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `requestTileServiceListeningState` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
