To identify potential sinks in the given API `onNotificationFeedbackReceived`, let's analyze its code step by step:

1. **Method Invocation**: The method `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2)` is invoked with the input parameters `p1` and `p2`. This invocation follows one of the positive rules because it takes the input parameters as arguments.

2. **Field Access/Update**: There's no direct field access or update that follows the positive rules for being a sink in this context. The fields accessed (e.g., `this.mNotificationDelegate`) are more about setting up the environment for the method invocation rather than directly contributing to a sensitive data flow.

3. **Object Creation and Data Flow**: There is no object creation here that directly relates to the API's input parameters or has naming similarity with the API name, following the rules for being considered a sink.

Given this analysis, we can identify one set of instructions that collectively contribute to a potential sink:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "long v3 = Binder.clearCallingIdentity();",
        "this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);",
        "Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3);"
    ]
]
}
```

However, based on the negative rules provided:
- `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` are considered auxiliary operations as they are used to manage the caller's identity, which doesn't directly contribute to sensitive data handling.
- The actual method invocation `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);` is what handles the input parameters, but considering the context of the entire API call, it's essential to recognize that the true sensitivity might lie in how `p1` and `p2` are handled within `onNotificationFeedbackReceived`, which isn't directly visible here.

Given this clarification and focusing strictly on the provided code snippet without additional assumptions about the sensitivity of operations not explicitly detailed:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);"
    ]
]
}
```

This reflects that the primary concern for data flow and potential sink within this API call is how it invokes another method with its input parameters.
