To assign an access control level to the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method calls `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and then invokes `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);` before restoring the calling identity with `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3);`. This pattern suggests that the method is careful about managing the caller's identity, which is a common practice when interacting with sensitive operations or components that require specific permissions or access control.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);` indicates that this method delegates its functionality to another component (`mNotificationDelegate`). This delegation suggests that the actual handling of the notification feedback is done elsewhere, possibly in a system or signature protected context.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **onNotificationVisibilityChanged**: This API has a high similarity score and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code also delegates to `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationVisibilityChanged(p1, p2);`, similar to the method in question.
   - **onNotificationDirectReplied**: With another high similarity score and the same access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this API's code pattern is consistent with delegating tasks to a notification delegate.

Given these observations:
- The method's interaction with `Binder` suggests it deals with operations that require careful management of caller identities.
- The delegation of work to `mNotificationDelegate` implies that the actual access control might be enforced at the delegate level, which could be system or signature protected.
- Similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are likely protected either by system permissions or signature-level access controls.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to conclude that `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` should also have a similar access control level due to its functional similarities with the other analyzed APIs and its careful handling of caller identities.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
