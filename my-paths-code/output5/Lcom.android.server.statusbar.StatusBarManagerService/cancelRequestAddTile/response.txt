To analyze the provided code paths for potential sinks, we must follow the guidelines given:

- Identify instructions that collectively contribute to a sink.
- Pay special attention to method invocations, field access and updates, object creation, and data flows.

Given the two paths are identical, we'll proceed with analyzing one of them. The API `cancelRequestAddTile` takes a `String p1` as an input parameter.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Method Invocation**: `this.mCurrentRequestAddTilePackages.remove(p1);`
   - This method invocation directly processes the input parameter `p1`. It has naming similarity with the API name, suggesting it could be part of a sink.
   
2. **Field Access and Update**:
   - The field `mCurrentRequestAddTilePackages` is accessed and potentially updated through the `remove` operation. However, there's no direct return or usage of this field in a way that suggests it's being used to propagate sensitive data directly back out of the API.

3. **Method Invocation**: `this.mBar.cancelRequestAddTile(p1);`
   - This method invocation also processes the input parameter `p1` and has naming similarity with the API name, indicating it could be part of a sink.
   
The instructions that contribute to potential sinks in this API are related to how the input parameter `p1` is processed:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "Object v5 = this.mCurrentRequestAddTilePackages.remove(p1);",
        "this.mBar.cancelRequestAddTile(p1);"
    ]
]
}
```

In this analysis, both method invocations (`remove` and `cancelRequestAddTile`) are considered part of the sink because they directly process the input parameter `p1`, following at least one of the positive rules (having naming similarity with the API name and processing the input parameters). The field access and update do not contribute to a separate sink due to the lack of direct data propagation back out of the API in a manner that would suggest an additional, distinct sensitive operation.
