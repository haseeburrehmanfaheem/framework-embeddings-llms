To determine the access control level for the `clearNotificationEffects` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `clearNotificationEffects` involves clearing notification effects by calling `this.mNotificationDelegate.clearEffects();`. This operation is wrapped around `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3);`, which are used to clear and restore the calling identity, respectively. This suggests that the method is interacting with a system component or service that requires identity management for security purposes.

2. **Sink Code**: The provided sink code is empty (`['']`), indicating there might not be specific sensitive data directly handled by this method that we need to consider from the perspective of data leakage or tampering. However, the interaction with notification effects could potentially impact system behavior or user experience.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `addOnPermissionsChangeListener(Landroid/permission/IOnPermissionsChangeListener;)V` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method seems to be related to managing permissions changes listeners and does not directly imply a high level of danger or sensitivity.
   - `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` also has an access control level of `NONE`. This method is about checking permission revocation status, which involves querying the system's permission state but doesn't inherently suggest a dangerous operation.

Given these points:
- The `clearNotificationEffects` method does not seem to directly handle sensitive user data or perform operations that could compromise system security or integrity in a significant way based on the information provided.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting their operations are considered safe and do not pose significant risks.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, since the method interacts with system components (like notification delegates) but does so in a manner that is wrapped with identity management calls and considering it doesn't directly handle sensitive data or perform dangerous operations as per the provided similar APIs, the access control level for `clearNotificationEffects` could be considered as `NORMAL`. This reflects its interaction with system functionalities without posing significant risks.
