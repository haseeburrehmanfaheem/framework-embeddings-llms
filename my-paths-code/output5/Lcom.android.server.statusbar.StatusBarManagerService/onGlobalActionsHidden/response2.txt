To determine the access control level for the `onGlobalActionsHidden` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `onGlobalActionsHidden` checks if `mGlobalActionListener` is not null (or not equal to 0) and then calls `onGlobalActionsDismissed` on it. This action does not directly interact with sensitive user data, hardware components, or system resources that would typically require higher access control levels like DANGEROUS. The method seems to be part of a listener/callback mechanism related to global actions (likely related to system UI elements), and its primary function is to notify listeners about the state change.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet provided also points towards notifying a listener (`mGlobalActionListener`) about an event (`onGlobalActionsDismissed`). This further reinforces the notion that this method is involved in callback mechanisms rather than direct access or manipulation of sensitive data/resources.

3. **Similar API Analysis**: 
   - The similar API, `onGlobalActionsShown()`, has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This suggests that both showing and hiding global actions are considered system-level operations or require signature permission to interact with the global action listener.
   - Given the similarity score of 0.8765063285827637 between these two methods (`onGlobalActionsHidden` and `onGlobalActionsShown`), it is reasonable to infer they operate within similar security contexts.

Considering these points:
- **NONE** seems too permissive given the potential system-level nature of global actions.
- **NORMAL** might not fully capture the possible system or signature requirements for interacting with such listeners, especially considering the similar API's access level.
- **DANGEROUS** typically involves direct access to sensitive data or hardware capabilities, which doesn't seem directly applicable here based on the provided code and context.
- **SYS_OR_SIG** appears most appropriate given the method's system-level implications (notifying about global action states) and its similarity with `onGlobalActionsShown`, which already has this access control level.

Therefore, considering the similar API's access control level and the nature of the operation (`onGlobalActionsHidden`), it is logical to assign a similar access control level:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the method's involvement in system-level callbacks and its similarity with other methods that require system or signature permissions.
