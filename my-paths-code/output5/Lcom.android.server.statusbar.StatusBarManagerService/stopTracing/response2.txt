To determine the access control level for the `stopTracing` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the sinks it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided `stopTracing` method checks a condition (`if (this.mBar == 0)`) and then calls `this.mBar.stopTracing();` if the condition is true. It also sets `this.mTracingEnabled = 0;` before calling `stopTracing()` on `mBar`. The sink code `['this.mBar.stopTracing();']` directly points to an action that stops tracing, presumably related to debugging or performance monitoring.

The similar APIs provided are both named `startTracing()V`, with high similarity scores. Both of these methods have an access control level of `NONE` and involve starting tracing by calling `this.mBar.startTracing();`. One of them also sets `this.mTracingEnabled = 1;`.

Given the similarities in structure and purpose between `stopTracing` and `startTracing`, and considering that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that controlling tracing (either starting or stopping) does not require elevated permissions. These operations seem to be part of normal application functionality related to debugging or performance monitoring, which does not typically involve sensitive user data or system resources that would necessitate higher access controls.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons with similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `stopTracing` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`, as it aligns with the behavior and security considerations of its counterparts in starting tracing operations.
