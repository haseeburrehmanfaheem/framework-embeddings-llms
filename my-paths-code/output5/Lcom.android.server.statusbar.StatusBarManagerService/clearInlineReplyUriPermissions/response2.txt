To determine the access control level for the `clearInlineReplyUriPermissions` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis of `clearInlineReplyUriPermissions`:**
   - The method takes a `String` parameter `p1`, which is used in the call to `this.mNotificationDelegate.clearInlineReplyUriPermissions(p1, v3)`.
   - It uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the UID of the calling process and stores it in `v3`. This suggests that the method is aware of and interacts with the caller's identity.
   - It then calls `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and restores it later, which is a common pattern for temporarily clearing the calling identity to perform operations without affecting the current caller's permissions or identity.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`onClearAllNotifications(I)V`:** This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also retrieves the calling UID and PID but does not clear the calling identity temporarily like `clearInlineReplyUriPermissions`.
   - **`onNotificationClick(Ljava/lang/String;Lcom/android/internal/statusbar/NotificationVisibility;)V`:** This API is also classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`. Similar to `clearInlineReplyUriPermissions`, it retrieves the calling UID and PID, clears the calling identity temporarily, and then performs an operation.

Given these observations:
- All methods interact with sensitive operations related to notifications.
- The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and temporary clearing of the calling identity in `clearInlineReplyUriPermissions` is similar to patterns seen in `SYS_OR_SIG` classified APIs, indicating a need for system or signature-level permission to perform these actions securely.

**Conclusion:**
Given the similarities with other APIs classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, the interaction with notification delegates which typically require privileged access, and the handling of caller identities, it's reasonable to conclude that `clearInlineReplyUriPermissions` should also be classified as requiring system or signature-level permission for its operations.
