To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationBubbleChanged` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other provided APIs, their assigned access control levels, and how these methods interact with sinks.

Given that:

1. The method `onNotificationBubbleChanged` interacts with a sink `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationBubbleChanged(p1, p2, p3);`, which suggests it is delegating some functionality related to notification bubbles.
2. Two similar APIs are provided:
   - `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`: This has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The method interacts with a sink similarly by calling `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationVisibilityChanged(p1, p2);`.
   - `onBubbleMetadataFlagChanged`: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onBubbleMetadataFlagChanged(p1, p2);`.

Both similar APIs have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they require system or signature-level permission to be invoked. This suggests that operations related to notification visibility and bubble metadata are sensitive and should only be performed by authorized components.

Given the similarities in purpose (all relate to notifications and bubble management), code structure (all delegate their functionality to `this.mNotificationDelegate` methods), and considering the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `onNotificationBubbleChanged` also requires a restricted access level to prevent unauthorized modifications or access to notification bubbles.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, the `onNotificationBubbleChanged` method should also be assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
