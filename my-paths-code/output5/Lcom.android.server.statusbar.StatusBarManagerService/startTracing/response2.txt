To determine the access control level for the `startTracing` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with depth 0, both of which call `this.mBar.startTracing();`. One path also sets `this.mTracingEnabled = 1;`. This suggests that the primary action of `startTracing` is to initiate tracing through `this.mBar`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve calling `this.mBar.startTracing()` and setting `this.mTracingEnabled = 1;`, reinforcing that the method's main interaction is with `this.mBar` for tracing purposes.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two `stopTracing()` methods are provided as similar APIs, both with an access control level of `NONE`. These methods interact with `this.mBar` by calling `stopTracing()` on it.
   - The similarity in structure and interaction (calling a method on `this.mBar`) between `startTracing` and the provided `stopTracing` methods suggests that their security implications might be comparable.

Given these points, we can infer the following:
- The primary action of `startTracing` is related to initiating tracing, which seems to be a functionality that doesn't inherently require elevated permissions or pose significant security risks based on the provided similar APIs.
- Since both paths of execution involve calling `this.mBar.startTracing()`, and considering the similar `stopTracing` methods have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to deduce that `startTracing` might not necessitate stringent access controls.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the method's behavior, its interaction with sinks, and the similarity with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, we can conclude that the appropriate access control level for the `startTracing` method is also `NONE`.
