To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationSettingsViewed` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The given method is defined as follows:

```java
public void onNotificationSettingsViewed(String p1){
    long v3 = Binder.clearCallingIdentity();
    this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationSettingsViewed(p1);
    Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3);
    return;
}
```

This method calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationSettingsViewed(p1);` after clearing the calling identity and then restores it. The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` suggests that this method is interacting with a part of the system that requires careful management of the calling process's identity, typically to prevent leaks or to ensure that the operation is performed with the correct permissions.

The sink code `['this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationSettingsViewed(p1);']` further indicates that it delegates the action to another component (`mNotificationDelegate`), which might have its own access control and permission checks.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. **onNotificationVisibilityChanged** with a similarity score of 0.8364088535308838 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also delegates to `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationVisibilityChanged(p1, p2);`, indicating system or signature-level access is required for such operations.

2. **onNotificationDirectReplied** with a similarity score of 0.7672251462936401 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Similarly, it calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationDirectReplied(p1);`, suggesting that system or signature-level permissions are necessary.

Given these similarities and the fact that all these methods seem to interact with system-level components (notified through a delegate), and considering the use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` which implies interaction at a level requiring identity management for security reasons, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onNotificationSettingsViewed` method also requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the comparison with other APIs and the code semantics, the final access control level for the `original_method` API (which is `onNotificationSettingsViewed`) would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This conclusion is drawn from the method's interaction with system-level components, the need for managing calling identities, and the similarity in access control levels of comparable APIs.
