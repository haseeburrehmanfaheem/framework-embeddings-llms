To assign an access control level to the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method has a depth of 1 and interacts with the `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationExpansionChanged(p1, p2, p3, p4)` sink. The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` to manage the calling identity, which is a common pattern in Android APIs.

The similar APIs provided have high similarity scores (0.8060353398323059 and 0.7915826439857483) with the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities in code structure, sink interactions, and access control levels between the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method and its similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, the final access control level for the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
