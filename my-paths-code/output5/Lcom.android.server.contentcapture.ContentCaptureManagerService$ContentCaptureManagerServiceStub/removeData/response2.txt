To assign an access control level to the `removeData` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeData` API has two paths, both of which involve the following key operations:

1. Checking the caller's UID and package name.
2. Verifying if ContentCapture is enabled for the user.
3. Scheduling an asynchronous request using `RemoteContentCaptureService.scheduleAsyncRequest`.

The sink code provided shows that the `removeData` API interacts with the `RemoteContentCaptureService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda2` class, which is used to schedule an asynchronous request.

Now, let's compare this with the similar APIs:

1. `isContentCaptureFeatureEnabled`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7959104180335999 and 0.7950029373168945, indicating that it shares some similarities with the `removeData` API. However, its access control level is `NONE`, which suggests that it does not pose a significant security risk.

After analyzing the code and comparing it with similar APIs, we can conclude that the `removeData` API does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it primarily involves checking the caller's UID and scheduling an asynchronous request. However, since it interacts with the `RemoteContentCaptureService`, which may have some security implications, we should assign a moderate access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `removeData` API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
