Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public void resetTemporaryService(int p1){
    this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);
    return;
}
```

Here is the JSON response with identified sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);"
    ]
]
}
```

The instruction `this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);` invokes a method (`resetTemporaryService`) that takes an input parameter `p1`, which follows the positive rule of having naming similarity with the API name and processing the input parameters. This suggests a potential sink as it directly propagates the API's input to another internal method call, potentially affecting system state or behavior.
