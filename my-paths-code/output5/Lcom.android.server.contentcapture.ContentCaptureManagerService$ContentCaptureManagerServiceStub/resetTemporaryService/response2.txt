To determine the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet**: The `resetTemporaryService` method calls `this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);`, which indicates it is delegating its operation to another instance or a parent class.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code is essentially the same as the method's body, confirming that the primary action of this method is to call `resetTemporaryService` on `this.this$0`.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **API Name**: `setTemporaryService(ILjava/lang/String;I)V`
   - **Similarity Score**: 0.8328460454940796
   - **Access Control Level**: NONE

Given the high similarity score between `resetTemporaryService` and `setTemporaryService`, it suggests that these two methods are closely related in terms of functionality or purpose. The access control level of `NONE` for `setTemporaryService` implies that this method does not require any specific permissions or access controls to be executed.

Considering these points, since `resetTemporaryService` is similar to `setTemporaryService` which has an access control level of `NONE`, and there's no indication from the provided code snippets that `resetTemporaryService` requires any special permissions (such as those related to sensitive user data, system resources, etc.) that would categorize it under `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if we consider `NORMAL` to imply some level of access control or permission checking not explicitly mentioned here, the most logical conclusion is that `resetTemporaryService` also does not require any specific access control.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the lack of evidence suggesting the need for permissions or special access controls, the final access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
