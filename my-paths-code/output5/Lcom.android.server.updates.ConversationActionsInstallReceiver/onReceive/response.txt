To analyze this API and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, we need to examine each instruction carefully.

Given the method `onReceive`, it takes two parameters: `Context p1` and `Intent p2`. Inside this method:

1. **Creation of a new object**: An instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created with parameters `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`. This follows the positive rule for object creation since it involves data flow from the API parameters (`p1` and `p2`) to the newly created object.

2. **Method invocation**: The `start()` method of the newly created object `v1` is invoked. Although this does not directly fit into one of the explicitly mentioned rules, its relevance depends on understanding what `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` represents and the purpose of its `start()` method. However, given that it's an inner class instance being started, we can consider its creation and invocation as part of a potential sink because it processes API parameters indirectly.

Here is the JSON representation of the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v1.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This sink involves the creation and starting of an inner class instance, which processes API parameters. Given there's only one set of instructions that contribute to a potential sink in this method, ranking is straightforward. The sensitivity level might depend on what `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` does with its parameters, but based solely on the provided information, we identify it as a single coherent set of instructions contributing to a potential sink.
