To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The given `onReceive` method has the following characteristics:
- It takes a `Context` and an `Intent` as parameters.
- Inside the method, it creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor, and then starts this instance.

The sink code provided also shows the creation and starting of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`.

Comparing this with similar APIs:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.
- Their code snippets are identical to the one in the `onReceive` method we're analyzing, involving the creation and start of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`.

Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and their functionality is identical to the method in question, it suggests that this method does not require any special permissions or access controls beyond what is normally required for its operation. The creation and starting of a receiver or a service within an app's context typically do not pose significant security risks if properly managed within the app's scope.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its operations, the `onReceive` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.
