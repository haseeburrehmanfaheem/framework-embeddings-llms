To determine the access control level for the `isHibernatingGlobally` method, let's analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - The method checks if a package is hibernating globally based on the state stored in `mGlobalHibernationStates`.
   - It also involves checking the calling UID's permission to query packages using `canQueryPackage`, indicating a form of access control.
   - The return values are based on the hibernation state or a default value if certain conditions aren't met.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setHibernatingGlobally**: This method sets the global hibernation state for a package and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It directly modifies the hibernation state, which is a more critical operation than querying it.
   - **setHibernatingForUser**: Similar to `setHibernatingGlobally`, this method also sets the hibernation state but for a specific user and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves additional checks and operations related to user handling.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions, which is typical for operations that modify system states or sensitive data.
   - The `isHibernatingGlobally` method, however, is querying the state rather than modifying it. Querying operations generally require less stringent access controls compared to modification operations.

4. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that `isHibernatingGlobally` involves checking permissions with `canQueryPackage`, which suggests some level of access control, but it does not modify system states like the similar APIs.
   - The method's primary purpose is to retrieve information about a package's hibernation state, which aligns more closely with operations that require normal or less stringent access controls.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `isHibernatingGlobally` seems to be `NORMAL`, as it involves querying system states without modifying them and includes permission checks. This level reflects a balance between providing necessary information while still respecting the privacy and security of package-related data.
