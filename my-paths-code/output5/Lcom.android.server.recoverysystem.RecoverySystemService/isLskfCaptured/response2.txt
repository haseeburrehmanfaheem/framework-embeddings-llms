To determine the access control level for the `isLskfCaptured` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `isLskfCaptured` method checks if a given string (`p1`) is contained within `mCallerPreparedForReboot`. If it is, the method returns `0` or `1` based on the path taken, indicating whether the LSKF (likely a specific state or condition related to the caller and reboot preparation) has been captured for the provided parameter.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets show conditional logic based on the presence of `p1` in `mCallerPreparedForReboot`, which influences the return value (`0` or `1`). This doesn't directly reveal sensitive information but indicates a check related to reboot preparation and caller state.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API, `clearLskf(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`, has an access control level of `NONE`. 
   - This method not only checks the presence of a string in `mCallerPreparedForReboot` but also performs actions like removing elements from `mCallerPendingRequest` and `mCallerPreparedForReboot`, and then clears reboot escrow through `LockSettingsInternal`.
   - Despite interacting with potentially sensitive operations (e.g., clearing escrow), its access control level is `NONE`.

Given the similarities in operation (checking presence in a collection related to caller state and reboot preparation) but noting that `isLskfCaptured` does not modify any state or interact with external services beyond this check, we can infer that it likely operates within a similar security context as its similar APIs.

However, since `isLskfCaptured` only performs a read operation without modifying sensitive data or invoking potentially dangerous operations like the `clearLskf` method does (which interacts with `LockSettingsInternal` and modifies state), but still deals with caller preparation for reboot (a potentially security-relevant context), we need to consider if its access control should reflect any potential risks.

Given that:
- It doesn't perform dangerous operations directly.
- Its similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating they are not considered to pose significant risk.
- The method itself does not seem to reveal sensitive information or modify critical state.

**Conclusion**: Given the above analysis and considering the principle of least privilege, where access control should be as restrictive as necessary but no more, we assign an access control level that reflects the method's functionality without overestimating its potential impact on system security.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
