To determine the access control level for the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The method interacts with system properties and services related to recovery and boot processes, which are sensitive operations.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` method checks various system properties (`init.svc.uncrypt`, `init.svc.setup-bcb`, `init.svc.clear-bcb`) and based on their states, it performs actions like setting up a service (`setup-bcb`), connecting to a recovery service, and eventually rebooting the device into recovery mode. These operations are critical for the device's boot and recovery processes.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `clearBcb()Z` and `setupBcb(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permission to execute. Both methods deal with setting up or clearing the boot-related services, which are sensitive operations.
   - The similarity in code structure and functionality between these APIs and `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` suggests that `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` also deals with critical system operations.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the method's interaction with system properties and its role in rebooting the device into recovery mode, it poses significant risks if misused. Thus, it requires a high level of access control.
   - The similarity with `clearBcb()Z` and `setupBcb(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`, both having an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, further supports assigning a similar access control level to `rebootRecoveryWithCommand`.

Based on the analysis, the appropriate access control level for the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` method is `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it involves critical system operations that require either system or signature-level permissions to prevent misuse.
