Based on the provided code, here is the analysis of potential sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$22 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$22(p0,p1);",
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
    ]
]
}
```

In this code, the creation of a new `HdmiControlService$BinderService$22` object and its subsequent use in `runOnServiceThread` method form a coherent set of instructions that together contribute to a potential sink. The input parameter `p1` is directly used in creating the new object, which then influences the execution of `runOnServiceThread`. This follows at least one of the positive rules (creation of new objects with data flow from API parameters). 

The method invocation `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` does not directly contribute to a sink as it doesn't have naming similarity with the API name, nor does its return value or any field access influence other parts of the code that could be considered sinks. This operation appears to be an auxiliary operation, setting up context for subsequent actions, and thus follows one of the negative rules.
