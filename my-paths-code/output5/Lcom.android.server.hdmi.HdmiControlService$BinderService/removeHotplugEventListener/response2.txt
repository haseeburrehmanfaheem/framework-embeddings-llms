To determine the access control level for the `removeHotplugEventListener` method, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeHotplugEventListener` method appears to remove a listener that is registered to receive hotplug events related to HDMI connections. This operation seems to be managing or configuring the system's behavior in response to external device connections, which could imply a level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications to the system's configuration.

Looking at the provided paths for the API:

1. The first path checks if there are any records in `mHotplugEventListenerRecords`, and if so, it attempts to remove the listener by unlinking its death recipient and then removing the record. This suggests an operation that modifies internal state based on external input (the listener to be removed), which could have security implications.
2. The second path simply checks if there are any records and returns without taking further action if there are none, indicating a simpler case where no actual removal is performed.

Given these observations:

- **Similar API 1:** `clearNotificationEffects()V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method seems to be related to clearing effects associated with notifications, which could be considered a system-level operation affecting how the device behaves or presents information. The similarity in score suggests that both methods might deal with system-level configurations or behaviors.
  
- **Similar API 2:** `addOnPermissionsChangeListener(Landroid/permission/IOnPermissionsChangeListener;)V` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method involves adding a listener for permission changes, which could be seen as less directly impactful on the system's security posture compared to removing event listeners that might affect system behavior (like hotplug events).

Considering these points:

- The operation of removing a hotplug event listener seems more closely related to system configuration and behavior management than to adding a permissions change listener.
- There are no clear indicators from the provided code snippets or similar APIs that this method directly deals with sensitive data or operations that would categorically classify it as `DANGEROUS`.
- The operation is not explicitly restricted to system or signature applications based on the information given, but managing hotplug event listeners could be considered a privileged operation affecting system behavior.

Given these considerations and the fact that removing an event listener might have implications for how the device interacts with external peripherals (potentially affecting security or functionality), it seems reasonable to consider this method as requiring some level of access control. However, without explicit indicators of it dealing with highly sensitive data or operations typically reserved for `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` levels, and considering its functional similarity to system configuration methods, the most appropriate access control level might lean towards a moderate restriction.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `removeHotplugEventListener` API could be considered as `NORMAL`, reflecting its role in managing system behavior without clear evidence of it requiring the highest levels of access control (like `SYS_OR_SIG`) or dealing with sensitive operations directly categorized under `DANGEROUS`.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is made considering the method's functionality and the comparisons drawn with similar APIs, acknowledging that specific platform security models might further refine these categorizations based on detailed threat analyses not explicitly covered here.
