Based on the provided information, I will analyze the API and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `getSystemAudioMode` API appears to be related to HDMI audio modes and interacts with local devices and their audio settings. The code snippet shows that it checks the system audio mode and returns a boolean value.

The similar APIs, `canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs seem to be checking if the system audio mode can be changed, which is related to the functionality of `getSystemAudioMode`.

Given the similarity in functionality and the fact that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getSystemAudioMode` API.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the analysis of the API's functionality and its similarity to other APIs with known access control levels. The `NONE` access control level suggests that this API does not pose a significant risk or require special permissions to access.
