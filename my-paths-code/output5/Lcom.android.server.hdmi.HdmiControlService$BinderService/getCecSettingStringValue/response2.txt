To determine the access control level for the `getCecSettingStringValue` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**: The similar APIs provided are `getCecSettingIntValue(Ljava/lang/String;)I`, with two instances having similarity scores of 0.9196377992630005 and 0.9126318693161011, respectively. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the operations involved in retrieving CEC setting values (whether integer or string) might not require strict access controls since they are related to retrieving configuration settings rather than modifying system states or accessing sensitive information.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippets for `getCecSettingStringValue` show that it involves reading from shared preferences or global settings based on the storage type of the CEC setting. This operation does not seem to modify any system state or access sensitive user data directly; it's more about retrieving configuration values.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided shows interactions with `HdmiCecConfig` and `mStorageAdapter`, which are involved in managing and retrieving HDMI CEC settings. There is no apparent interaction with sensitive data (like location, contacts, or external storage) that would necessitate higher access control levels.

4. **Access Control Levels**:
   - **NONE**: Typically used for operations that do not affect system security or user privacy.
   - **NORMAL**: Used for operations that might have some implications on the system but are generally considered safe and do not require special permissions (e.g., internet access).
   - **DANGEROUS**: Applies to operations that could potentially harm the system, other apps, or user data (e.g., reading contacts, location).
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: Reserved for operations that only system applications or applications with a specific signature can perform.

Given these considerations, since `getCecSettingStringValue` is involved in retrieving CEC settings without apparent access to sensitive information or modification of system states, and considering the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a relatively low access control requirement.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of similar APIs, the nature of the operation (retrieving configuration settings), and the lack of interaction with sensitive data or system state modifications, the most appropriate access control level for the `getCecSettingStringValue` method is `NONE`.
