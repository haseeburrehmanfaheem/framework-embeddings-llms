To determine the access control level for the `queryDisplayStatus` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of queryDisplayStatus**: The method involves creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7` and then running it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`. This suggests interaction with the HDMI control service, which could potentially affect system resources or external devices connected via HDMI.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code is directly related to executing a specific task (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$7`) on the service thread, indicating a form of asynchronous operation that doesn't immediately return but might have implications for how the system handles subsequent requests or operations.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **powerOffRemoteDevice(II)V**: With an access control level of `NONE`, this API is similar in structure to `queryDisplayStatus` as it also executes a task (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$9`) on the service thread.
   - **powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V**: Also with an access control level of `NONE`, it follows a pattern akin to the other two, running (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$10`) on the service thread.

Given these points:
- The method and its similar APIs all seem to interact with system services (in this case, HDMI control) without directly accessing sensitive user data or performing actions that could immediately compromise system security.
- They execute tasks asynchronously via a service thread, which is a common pattern in Android for handling operations that shouldn't block the main UI thread.

Considering these factors and comparing them with the provided similar APIs (`powerOffRemoteDevice` and `powerOnRemoteDevice`), all of which have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that `queryDisplayStatus` likely doesn't pose a significant risk in terms of data privacy or system integrity. Therefore, its access control level would logically align with those of the similar APIs.

**Final Access Control Level:**
