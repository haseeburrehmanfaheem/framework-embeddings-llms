To determine the access control level for the `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method has a similarity score of 0.8775 with `addHotplugEventListener` and 0.8514 with `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`. 

Looking at the code snippets for all three methods, we can see that they share similar patterns:
1. They all create a new record (e.g., `HdmiControlService$HdmiControlStatusChangeListenerRecord`, `HdmiControlService$HotplugEventListenerRecord`, `HdmiControlService$SystemAudioModeChangeListenerRecord`) and add it to a respective list (or records).
2. They link the listener's binder to death using `linkToDeath`.
3. The main difference in the code lies in how the subsequent operations are handled after adding the listener, but this does not seem to affect the access control level directly.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the similarities in their code patterns with `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`, it suggests that `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` also does not require elevated permissions or specific access controls beyond what is typical for such listener addition methods. 

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons, the access control level for `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` should be `NONE`.
