To determine the access control level for the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `powerOnRemoteDevice` involves setting a work source UID to the calling UID and then running a service thread with a newly created instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10`. This instance is passed parameters from the method call (`p0`, `p1`, `p2`).

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` and running it on a service thread. This suggests interaction with system services or threads, which could imply a certain level of access control.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`deviceSelect` and `powerOffRemoteDevice`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - They share high similarity scores (0.9957216382026672 and 0.9955384135246277, respectively) with the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method.
   - Their code snippets also follow a similar pattern: creating an instance of a specific class (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$1` for `deviceSelect`, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$9` for `powerOffRemoteDevice`) and running it on the service thread.

Given these points, we can infer that:
- The operations performed by `powerOnRemoteDevice` are closely related to system or service-level interactions (given the use of `runOnServiceThread`).
- However, both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that despite interacting with system services, they do not pose a significant risk that would warrant higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The high similarity in code structure and functionality between these methods further supports the notion that their security implications are likely comparable.

Therefore, considering the patterns of interaction with system threads and the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that `powerOnRemoteDevice` should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
