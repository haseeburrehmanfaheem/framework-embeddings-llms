To assign an access control level to the `portSelect` method, we should consider the following factors:

1.  **Similarity with other APIs**: The `portSelect` method has high similarity scores with `deviceSelect` (0.9971352219581604) and `powerOnRemoteDevice` (0.9949215054512024). Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.
2.  **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet for `portSelect` shows that it creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2` and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`. This pattern is similar to the code snippets of `deviceSelect` and `powerOnRemoteDevice`, which also create instances of different classes (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$1` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10`) and run them on the service thread.
3.  **Access Control Level**: Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and the code snippets are comparable, it suggests that the `portSelect` method does not require any specific permissions or restrictions to execute its functionality.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the `portSelect` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`, as it shares similarities with other APIs having this level and its code pattern does not indicate a need for elevated permissions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
