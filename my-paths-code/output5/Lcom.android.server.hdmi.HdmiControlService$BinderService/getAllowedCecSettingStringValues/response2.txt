Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method appears to be retrieving a list of allowed string values for a specific CEC setting. The method uses the `HdmiControlService` and `HdmiCecConfig` classes to interact with the HDMI settings.

The similar APIs provided, `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` and `getCecSettingStringValue`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with the HDMI settings, but they retrieve integer values or a single string value, respectively.

Considering the similarities between these methods, it is likely that the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because all three methods seem to be related to retrieving HDMI setting values, and there is no indication that the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method requires any special permissions or access controls.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the final access control level for the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
