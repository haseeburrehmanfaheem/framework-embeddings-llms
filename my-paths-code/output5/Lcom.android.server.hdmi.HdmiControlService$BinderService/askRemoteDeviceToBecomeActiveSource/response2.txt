To assign an access control level to the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method sets a work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, and then it creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11` with parameters `p0` and `p1`. This instance is then executed on the service thread by `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves creating a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11` and running it on the service thread, similar to what's seen in the provided API code snippets.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V**: This method has an access control level of `NONE`. It creates a different binder service instance (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$10`) but also runs it on the service thread.
   - **powerOffRemoteDevice(II)V**: Similar to `powerOnRemoteDevice`, this method has an access control level of `NONE`, creates another type of binder service instance (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$9`), and runs it on the service thread.

Given these similarities, all three methods seem to follow a pattern where they:
- Set up some form of service or control related to HDMI devices.
- Run specific actions on the service thread.
- Have been assigned `NONE` as their access control level in similar contexts.

Considering the provided information and the fact that both similar APIs (`powerOnRemoteDevice` and `powerOffRemoteDevice`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that the operations performed by these methods do not require elevated permissions or pose significant risks that would necessitate higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if we're strictly comparing to the provided examples.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the access control levels of the compared APIs, the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
