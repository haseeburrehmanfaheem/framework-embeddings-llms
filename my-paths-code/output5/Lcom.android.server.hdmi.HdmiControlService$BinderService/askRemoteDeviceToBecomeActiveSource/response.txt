Based on the provided code, here is the analysis:

The API `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` has a depth of 2 and takes an input parameter `p1`. 

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a potential sink set. The relevant instructions are:

- `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$11(p0,p1);` 
    This instruction creates a new object with dataflow from the API parameters (`p0` and `p1`). It follows one of the positive rules, which is the creation of new objects with dataflow from the API parameters.
- `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`
    Although this instruction doesn't directly create an object or access a field similar to the API name, it does take the created object `v5` as its argument. The object `v5` is influenced by the input parameter `p1`, which means there's a data propagation link between them.

Here is the JSON with the identified sink set:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "HdmiControlService$BinderService$11 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$11(p0,p1);",
            "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

The instruction `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();` is an auxiliary operation, as it seems to be setting a work source UID but does not directly influence the creation or usage of other objects that are returned by the API or have naming similarity with the API. Therefore, it's excluded from the sink set based on negative rules.
