After reviewing the provided information, I can see that the `getActiveSource` method is related to HDMI control and device information. The method has two paths with depth 2, and both paths involve checking the active source and creating a new `HdmiDeviceInfo` object.

The sink code snippets show that the method is building an `HdmiDeviceInfo` object using various parameters such as physical address, port ID, vendor ID, and display name.

Comparing this to the similar APIs provided, we can see that:

* The `canChangeSystemAudioMode()` API with a similarity score of 0.7915666699409485 has an access control level of NONE. This API seems to be checking if the system audio mode can be changed, which is related to HDMI control.
* The other `canChangeSystemAudioMode()` API with a similarity score of 0.7670490741729736 also has an access control level of NONE. This API involves getting the safe CEc device info.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, and considering the semantics of the `getActiveSource` method, I would conclude that this method does not pose a significant risk or require special permissions to access sensitive information.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getActiveSource` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarity with other APIs and the fact that the method seems to be primarily focused on retrieving device information, which does not require elevated permissions or pose a significant risk.
