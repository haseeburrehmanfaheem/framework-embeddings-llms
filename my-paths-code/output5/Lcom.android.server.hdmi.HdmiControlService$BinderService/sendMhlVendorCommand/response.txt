Here is the analysis of the provided API code:

The given method `sendMhlVendorCommand` has four parameters: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `byte[] p4`. The method creates a new instance of an anonymous inner class `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21` with these parameters. This object is then passed to the `runOnServiceThread` method.

The instructions that contribute to the sink are:
- Creation of the new object `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21`, which has a naming similarity with the API name and is created using the data flow from the API parameters.
- The `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)` call, where the newly created object `v5` is passed as an argument. This method invocation has an indirect connection to the API parameters through the object creation.

Here is the JSON output with the identified sink:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "HdmiControlService$BinderService$21 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$21(p0,p1,p2,p3,p4);",
            "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
        ]
    ]
}
