To determine the access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels. The given method interacts with the `HdmiControlService` through a binder service, creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21` and running it on the service thread.

The two similar APIs provided are:
1. `setSystemAudioVolume(III)V` with an access control level of `NONE`.
2. `sendVendorCommand(II[BZ)V` also with an access control level of `NONE`.

Both of these methods follow a similar pattern to `sendMhlVendorCommand`: they create an instance of a specific class (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$12` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15`, respectively) and run it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`.

Given that these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the similarities in their code structure (creating a class instance related to `HdmiControlService$BinderService` and executing it on the service thread), it's reasonable to infer that `sendMhlVendorCommand` would also have a similar access control requirement.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the comparison with similar APIs, the access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method should be `NONE`.
