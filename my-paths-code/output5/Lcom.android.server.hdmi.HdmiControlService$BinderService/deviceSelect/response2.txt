To determine the access control level for the `deviceSelect` method, we should analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `deviceSelect` method has the following characteristics:
- It takes an integer and an `IHdmiControlCallback` as parameters.
- It sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`.
- It creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$1` with the provided parameters and runs it on the service thread.

The similar APIs provided are:
- `portSelect(ILandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` with an access control level of `NONE`.
- `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V` with an access control level of `NONE`.

Both similar APIs have a high similarity score and the same access control level (`NONE`). They also follow a similar pattern by creating a new instance of a binder service class (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$2` for `portSelect` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` for `powerOnRemoteDevice`) and running it on the service thread, which is comparable to how `deviceSelect` operates.

Given these observations:
- The code pattern of `deviceSelect` is similar to that of `portSelect` and `powerOnRemoteDevice`, suggesting a comparable level of access control.
- Both provided APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, implying that they do not require special permissions or pose significant risks.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `deviceSelect` method would be `NONE`, as it aligns with the patterns and access control levels of its similar APIs.
