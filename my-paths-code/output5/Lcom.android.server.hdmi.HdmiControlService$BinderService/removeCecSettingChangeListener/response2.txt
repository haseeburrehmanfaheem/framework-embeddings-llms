To determine the access control level for the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method, we should analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of the Method**: The `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method is designed to remove a listener that has been previously registered to receive updates on HDMI CEC setting changes. The method checks if the listener (`p2`) exists in the records, and if so, it attempts to unregister it. If the unregistration results in no more registered callbacks for that listener, it removes the entry from the records and also notifies the `mHdmiCecConfig` to remove the change listener.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar APIs provided are variations of `addCecSettingChangeListener`, which have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods are responsible for adding a listener to receive updates on HDMI CEC setting changes.
   - Both `addCecSettingChangeListener` and `removeCecSettingChangeListener` deal with the management of listeners for CEC setting changes. The primary difference is that one adds a listener, while the other removes it.

3. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Given that `addCecSettingChangeListener` has an access control level of `NONE`, we can infer that managing (adding or removing) CEC setting change listeners does not require special permissions or pose significant security risks in this context.
   - The `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method, by its nature of removing a previously registered listener, doesnâ€™t inherently introduce new security risks or require elevated privileges compared to adding a listener.

**Conclusion**: Considering the functionality and comparison with similar APIs, the access control level for `removeCecSettingChangeListener` should be consistent with that of `addCecSettingChangeListener`, which is `NONE`. This conclusion is based on the method's role in managing listeners without introducing significant security risks or requiring special permissions.
