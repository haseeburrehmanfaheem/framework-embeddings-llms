To determine the access control level for the `sendStandby` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs along with their access control levels.

The `sendStandby` method's code involves:
1. Setting the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`.
2. Creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$16` with parameters `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`.
3. Running the created instance on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`.

The sink code for `sendStandby` is focused on the creation of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$16` and its execution on the service thread, which suggests interaction with system services or internal components.

Given similar APIs:
- `setSystemAudioMode` with an access control level of `NONE`. Its code involves creating a different binder service instance (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$8`) but also runs it on the service thread.
- `portSelect` with an access control level of `NONE`. Its code is similar, involving another binder service instance (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$2`) executed on the service thread.

Observations:
- All methods interact with system services or internal components by running tasks on the service thread.
- The primary difference lies in the specific binder service instances created and the parameters passed to them.
- Despite these differences, both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not pose significant risks or require special permissions beyond normal application execution.

Given the similarities in code structure and the fact that both comparable APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that `sendStandby` is likely to follow a similar security posture. The method does not appear to directly interact with sensitive data or operations that would necessitate a higher access control level like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons, the access control level for the `sendStandby` method should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
