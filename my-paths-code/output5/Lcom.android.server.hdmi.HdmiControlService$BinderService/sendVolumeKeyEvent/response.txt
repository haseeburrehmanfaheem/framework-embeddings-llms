Here's the JSON output with identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "HdmiControlService$BinderService$4 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$4(p0,p1,p2,p3);",
      "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The creation of the `HdmiControlService$BinderService$4` object (`v5`) is a potential sink because it follows one of the positive rules: its creation involves data flow from API parameters (`p1`, `p2`, and `p3`). This directly influences the input or creation of the next instruction.
- The method invocation `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)` is also part of this sink set because it processes the object created in the previous step, demonstrating a clear data flow link between these instructions. 
- Both instructions are not isolated but collectively contribute to handling sensitive API parameters (`p1`, `p2`, and `p3`), thus forming a coherent set of instructions that together represent a potential sink.
- The method `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` seems like an auxiliary operation (setting context information) and does not directly contribute to the processing or flow of sensitive data related to the API's primary function, so it is not included in this sink set.
