Based on the provided code and the rules for identifying sinks, here is the analysis:

The API `addVendorCommandListener` invokes another method with a similar name (`addVendorCommandListener`) and passes its input parameters (`p1` and `p2`) to this method. This matches one of the positive rules for identifying sinks: a method invocation that takes the input parameters as arguments.

Here is the identified sink in JSON format:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();",
        "this.this$0.addVendorCommandListener(p1, p2);"
    ]
]
}
```
