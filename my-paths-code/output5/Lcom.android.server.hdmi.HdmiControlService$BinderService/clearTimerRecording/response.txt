Based on the provided code, here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$20 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$20(p0,p1,p2,p3);",
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
    ]
]
}
```

Explanation:
- The creation of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$20` object has naming similarity to the API and is created with data flow from the API parameters (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`). 
- This new object is then passed as an argument to `runOnServiceThread` method, indicating a direct influence of one instruction on the other.
- The call to `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` seems like an auxiliary operation (obtaining or setting context information) and does not directly contribute to any data flow related to the parameters or return values, thus it is excluded as per negative rules.
