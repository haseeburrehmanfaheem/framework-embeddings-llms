To determine the access control level for the `clearTimerRecording` method, we should consider the following factors:

1. **Similarity with other APIs**: The provided similar APIs, `setSystemAudioVolume(III)V` and `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V`, both have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that methods with similar functionality and structure might not require strict access control.

2. **Code Structure and Sinks**: The code snippet for `clearTimerRecording` involves creating a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$20` and running it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`. This pattern is consistent with the provided similar APIs, which also create instances of inner classes (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$12` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10`) and run them on the service thread.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose a significant risk or do not handle sensitive data.
   - `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, and `SYS_OR_SIG` are progressively more restrictive, reflecting increasing levels of potential risk or sensitivity.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering that there is no explicit indication of handling sensitive data or posing a significant risk, it's reasonable to infer that `clearTimerRecording` should also have a similar access control level.

**Conclusion**: Based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, the access control level for `clearTimerRecording` should be `NONE`.
