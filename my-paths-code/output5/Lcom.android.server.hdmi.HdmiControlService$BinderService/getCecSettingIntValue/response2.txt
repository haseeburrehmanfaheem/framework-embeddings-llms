To determine the access control level for the `getCecSettingIntValue` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**: The similar APIs provided (`getCecSettingStringValue`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that accessing CEC setting values (whether string or integer) does not pose significant security risks as to require higher access control levels like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**: 
   - The method interacts with the `HdmiCecConfig` and uses settings stored in `this.mSettings`. It retrieves a setting based on the input string `p1`.
   - It checks if the setting exists (`boolean v9 = this.mSettings.containsKey(p1);`) and handles default values or specific storage retrieval mechanisms (shared preference or global setting) based on the setting's configuration.
   - The method does not appear to modify any settings but rather retrieves existing ones, which generally aligns with read-only operations that typically do not require stringent access control.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves checking if a key exists in `mSettings`, retrieving its value, and then possibly reading from shared preferences or global settings based on the setting's storage type.
   - These operations are focused on data retrieval without any apparent capability to alter system state significantly or access sensitive information that would necessitate higher access control levels.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the nature of the method (retrieving CEC setting integer values) and its similarity to other methods with `NONE` access control level, along with the analysis of its code snippet and sink code, it appears that this method does not pose significant security risks.
   - The operations are primarily read-oriented without indications of modifying system settings or accessing sensitive data that would require elevated permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the provided information and analysis, the `getCecSettingIntValue` method should have an access control level of `NONE`, as it aligns with the behavior of similar methods and does not appear to introduce significant security risks through its operations.
