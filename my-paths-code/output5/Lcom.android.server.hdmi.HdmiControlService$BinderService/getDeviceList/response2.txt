To determine the access control level for the `getDeviceList` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getDeviceList` method is used to retrieve a list of devices. Here's a breakdown of what the method does:

1. It sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.
2. It accesses the `HdmiCecNetwork` instance and calls the `getSafeCecDevicesLocked()` method to retrieve a list of devices.
3. The retrieved list is then returned.

Now, let's compare this with the similar API `canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z`, which has an access control level of `NONE`. This method:

1. Accesses the `HdmiCecNetwork` instance using `HdmiCecLocalDevice.mService.getHdmiCecNetwork()`.
2. Calls the `getSafeCecDeviceInfo(5)` method to retrieve device information.

Both methods interact with the `HdmiCecNetwork` instance and access device-related information. However, `canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not pose a significant risk or require special permissions.

Given the similarities between the two methods and considering that `getDeviceList` only retrieves a list of devices without modifying any system settings or sensitive data, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getDeviceList` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
