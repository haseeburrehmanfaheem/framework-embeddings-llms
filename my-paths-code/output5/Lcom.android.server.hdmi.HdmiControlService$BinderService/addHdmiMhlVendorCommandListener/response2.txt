Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` method has three paths with similar code snippets, all of which create a new `HdmiControlService$HdmiMhlVendorCommandListenerRecord` object and link it to death using the `IBinder` interface. The sink code also shows the addition of this record to a list.

The similar APIs, `setHdmiRecordListener` and `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs have similar code structures, creating a new record object and linking it to death using the `IBinder` interface.

Given the similarities in code structure and the fact that the similar APIs have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
