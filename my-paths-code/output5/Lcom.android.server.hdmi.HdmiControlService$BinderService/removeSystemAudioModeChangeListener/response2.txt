Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method.

The method has two paths with depth 2, both of which call `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`, which is a common pattern in the provided similar APIs. The similar APIs, `oneTouchPlay` and `shouldHandleTvPowerKey`, both have an access control level of `NONE` and also call `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.

The sink code for `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` involves iterating over a list of listener records and potentially removing a record, but this operation does not seem to pose a significant security risk. The method does not appear to perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions or access control.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the semantics of the method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
