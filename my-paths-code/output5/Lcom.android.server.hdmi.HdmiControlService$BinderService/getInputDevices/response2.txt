To assign an access control level to the `getInputDevices` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs. 

The provided code snippet for `getInputDevices` shows that it interacts with `HdmiControlService` and `HdmiCecNetwork` to retrieve a list of input devices. Specifically, it calls `getSafeExternalInputsLocked()` on an instance of `HdmiCecNetwork` and merges the result with another list of MHL devices using `HdmiUtils.mergeToUnmodifiableList()`. The method returns this merged list.

The similar API provided is `canChangeSystemAudioMode()`, which has an access control level of `NONE`. This method interacts with `HdmiCecLocalDevice` and `HdmiCecNetwork` to retrieve information about the HDMI CEC device. 

Comparing these two methods, we can see that both are related to HDMI functionality but operate in slightly different domains: one deals with input devices, and the other with system audio mode capabilities.

Given this context, the decision for assigning an access control level to `getInputDevices` should consider whether it poses any risk or requires special permissions to execute. 

- `NONE` typically applies to methods that do not pose a security risk or require no special access rights.
- `NORMAL` might be applicable if the method involves operations that could potentially impact user data or device settings but are generally considered safe within the context of the application's normal operation.
- `DANGEROUS` is used for methods that directly affect sensitive aspects of the user's data, privacy, or the device's security and functionality, requiring explicit user consent or special system permissions.
- `SYS_OR_SIG` is relevant for operations that require system-level permissions or are signature-protected, indicating a higher level of access control.

Considering the nature of `getInputDevices`, which involves retrieving information about input devices without any direct implications on sensitive data, privacy, or requiring explicit user consent, it aligns more closely with methods that do not pose significant security risks. 

Therefore, based on its functionality and comparison with similar APIs like `canChangeSystemAudioMode()`, the access control level for `getInputDevices` should be `NONE`.
