Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` method to determine its access control level.

The method has three paths with depth 2, but they all share a common starting point:

1. `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`
2. Retrieval of a local device from `this.mLocalDevices.get(0)` and casting it to `HdmiCecLocalDeviceTv`.

The sink code provided also matches this pattern.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`: This API has an access control level of `NONE` and a similarity score of 0.8243894577026367. Its code snippet includes `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, which is also present in the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` method.
2. `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`: This API has an access control level of `NONE` and a similarity score of 0.8175085783004761. Its code snippet only includes `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, which is also present in the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` method.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, it appears that the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` method does not require any special permissions or access controls. Therefore, I conclude that its access control level should be `NONE`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
