After analyzing the provided information, I will assign an access control level to the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` API.

The API has two paths with depth 2, and both paths involve iterating over a list of listener records (`mHdmiControlStatusChangeListenerRecords`) and potentially removing a record from the list. The sink code also involves unlinking a binder death recipient and removing a record from the list.

Comparing this API to the similar APIs provided, we can see that:

* `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` has an access control level of `NONE` and similar code for iterating over a list of listener records and potentially removing a record.
* `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` also has an access control level of `NONE` and similar code for adding a new listener record to the list.

Given the similarity in code and functionality between these APIs, it is likely that the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` API should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because the API is simply removing a listener from a list, which does not appear to pose any significant security risks.

Therefore, I assign the following access control level to the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` API:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
