Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method to determine its access control level. 

The method has a similarity score of 0.8717 with `addVendorCommandListener`, which has an access control level of NONE. It also has a similarity score of 0.8426 with `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, which also has an access control level of NONE.

Both similar APIs have the same `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` call, and their access control levels are NONE. This suggests that the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method is likely to have a similar access control level.

The method's code snippet only includes a call to `this.this$0.removeHdmiControlVolumeControlStatusChangeListener(p1)`, which does not seem to pose any significant security risks. Additionally, the presence of `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` is consistent with the similar APIs.

Considering these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method should be NONE.
