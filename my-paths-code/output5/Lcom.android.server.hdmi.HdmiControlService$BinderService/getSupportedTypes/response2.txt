To determine the access control level for the `getSupportedTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of `getSupportedTypes` Method:**
   - The method calls `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, which suggests it is interacting with system-level services.
   - It then retrieves a list of local devices (`HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$fgetmLocalDevices(this.this$0);`) and initializes an array based on the size of this list.

2. **Sink Code:**
   - The sink code snippet also involves retrieving local devices and initializing an array, similar to the method's code snippet.

3. **Similar APIs (Ground Truth):**
   - `canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z` with Access Control Level: NONE
     - This method interacts with local devices but does not seem to expose sensitive information directly.
   - `getActiveSource()Landroid/hardware/hdmi/HdmiDeviceInfo;` with Access Control Level: NONE
     - Builds and returns an `HdmiDeviceInfo` object, which could potentially contain device-specific information.

**Analysis:**
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE. This suggests that the operations they perform (interacting with local devices, checking capabilities, and returning device information) are not considered sensitive or dangerous from a security perspective.
- The `getSupportedTypes` method, by interacting with local devices and preparing to return supported types (which could be inferred as related to HDMI features or device capabilities), does not explicitly handle sensitive user data or perform operations that would typically require elevated permissions (like those classified under DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG).

**Conclusion:**
Given the similarities in functionality and access control levels of the provided APIs, and considering the nature of the `getSupportedTypes` method's interactions with system services and device information, it is reasonable to conclude that this method does not require a high level of access control. Therefore, its access control level should be consistent with the similar APIs provided.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This conclusion is based on the method's functionality appearing to be informational and related to device capabilities rather than involving sensitive data or actions that could compromise user privacy or system security.
