To determine the access control level for the `sendKeyEvent` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `sendKeyEvent` method is used to send key events. It takes three parameters: two integers (`p1`, `p2`) and a boolean (`p3`). The method sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` and then creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$3` with the provided parameters. This instance is then run on the service thread.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves creating a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$3` and running it on the service thread. This suggests that the method's primary interaction is with the HDMI control service, specifically through its binder service.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **deviceSelect**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It creates a `HdmiControlService$BinderService$1` instance and runs it on the service thread, similar to how `sendKeyEvent` operates.
   - **portSelect**: Also with an access control level of `NONE`, this method creates a `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2` instance and runs it on the service thread. The pattern here is consistent with `sendKeyEvent`.

4. **Similarity Scores**: Both similar APIs have high similarity scores (0.9916067123413086 for `deviceSelect` and 0.9913446307182312 for `portSelect`), indicating that their code structures and possibly their functionalities are very close to that of `sendKeyEvent`. This suggests that if they are considered safe enough to have an access control level of `NONE`, `sendKeyEvent` might follow the same logic due to its similar operational nature.

5. **Access Control Level Determination**: Given that both similar APIs (`deviceSelect` and `portSelect`) have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the high similarity scores along with the comparable code structure (involving running a service-specific task on a thread), it is reasonable to conclude that `sendKeyEvent` should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This determination is based on the pattern that these methods seem to follow standard, presumably safe, operational procedures within the HDMI control service context.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, along with the operational nature of `sendKeyEvent`, it's logical to assign an access control level of `NONE` to this method.
