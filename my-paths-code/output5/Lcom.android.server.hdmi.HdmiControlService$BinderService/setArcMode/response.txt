Based on the provided code, here is the analysis of potential sinks:

The API `setArcMode` takes a boolean parameter `p1`. 

Here are the identified sinks in JSON format:
```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "HdmiControlService$BinderService$14 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$14(p0);",
            "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

- `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();` is an auxiliary operation and does not directly contribute to a sink.
- The creation of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$14(p0);` has naming similarity with the API name, however it uses `p0`, which seems unrelated to the input parameter `p1`. However, since `v5` is used in `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`, we can consider this as part of a potential sink.
- The method invocation `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);` takes `v5` as an argument and has a data flow link with the creation of `v5`.
 
Note that there might be other sinks in the code not shown here (e.g., inside `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14` or `runOnServiceThread`). The provided analysis only considers the given snippet.
