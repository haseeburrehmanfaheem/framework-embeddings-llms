Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `setHdmiRecordListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setHdmiRecordListener` method has three paths with similar code snippets, all of which create a new `HdmiControlService$HdmiRecordListenerRecord` object and link it to the death of an `IBinder` object. This suggests that the method is used to register a listener for HDMI record events.

The similar APIs, `addDeviceEventListener` and `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, have similar code structures and are used to register listeners for device events and system audio mode changes, respectively. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given the similarities between the `setHdmiRecordListener` method and its similar APIs, it is likely that the `setHdmiRecordListener` method also requires no special permissions or access controls to function properly. Therefore, the access control level for the `setHdmiRecordListener` method should be `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
