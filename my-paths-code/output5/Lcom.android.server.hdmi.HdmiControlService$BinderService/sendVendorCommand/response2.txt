To determine the access control level for the `sendVendorCommand` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of sendVendorCommand**: This method involves setting a work source UID to the calling UID and then running a service thread with a newly created instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15`. The parameters include integers, a byte array, and a boolean value.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet shows the creation of an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15` and running it on the service thread. This indicates that the method is interacting with system services or internal components.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **clearTimerRecording(II[B)V**: Has a high similarity score (0.9937217831611633) with `sendVendorCommand`. Its access control level is `NONE`.
   - **setSystemAudioVolume(III)V**: Also has a high similarity score (0.9933525323867798) with `sendVendorCommand`. Its access control level is `NONE`.

Given these points, the decision for assigning an access control level to `sendVendorCommand` can be made based on the following reasoning:

- **Similarity and Access Control of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that operations related to sending vendor commands, clearing timer recordings, or setting system audio volumes do not require elevated permissions in this context.

- **Nature of the Operation**: The operation involves sending a vendor command, which might interact with hardware or system-level components. However, based on the similar APIs provided, it seems that such interactions do not necessitate higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

- **Code Semantics**: The method's implementation does not directly indicate any dangerous operations (e.g., accessing sensitive data, modifying system settings without user consent) that would typically require stricter access controls.

Based on the analysis of similar APIs and the nature of the operation performed by `sendVendorCommand`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should have an access control level consistent with the similar APIs provided, which is `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level:**
