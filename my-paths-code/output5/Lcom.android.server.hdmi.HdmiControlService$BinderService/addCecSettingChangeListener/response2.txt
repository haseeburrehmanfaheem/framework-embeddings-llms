To determine the access control level for the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `addCecSettingChangeListener` method is designed to add a listener for changes in CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) settings. This involves registering a callback with the `HdmiCecConfig` object and managing records of listeners in `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords`.

2. **Analyzing Paths**: Both paths (1 and 2) for this API involve checking if a listener already exists (`this.mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords.containsKey(p2)`). If the listener is new, path 1 creates a new `RemoteCallbackList`, adds it to the records, registers a change listener with `mHdmiCecConfig`, and then attempts to register the provided listener. Path 2, which seems to be for an existing listener, directly retrieves the list from the records and attempts to register the listener.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets show operations related to managing callback lists (`RemoteCallbackList`) and registering/unregistering change listeners with `mHdmiCecConfig`. These are critical for handling CEC setting changes but do not directly imply a need for elevated access control based on their functionality alone.

4. **Similar APIs Analysis**: The provided similar APIs, `removeCecSettingChangeListener`, have an access control level of `NONE`. This method is used to remove listeners and also interacts with the same records and config objects as `addCecSettingChangeListener`. The similarity in functionality (adding vs. removing a listener) and the fact that removal does not require elevated access suggests that addition might also not need strict access controls.

5. **Access Control Decision**: Given the above analysis, the decision for the access control level of `addCecSettingChangeListener` hinges on understanding whether adding a CEC setting change listener poses significant risks or requires special privileges. The method seems to be managing internal state and callbacks rather than accessing sensitive user data or performing actions that could compromise system security directly.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `addCecSettingChangeListener`, by analogy with its similar APIs and considering the nature of its operations, would likely be `NONE`. This conclusion is based on the method's functionality not inherently requiring elevated privileges or posing direct security risks through its operations.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision reflects an understanding that managing CEC setting change listeners does not directly involve sensitive operations or data access that would necessitate higher access control levels like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
