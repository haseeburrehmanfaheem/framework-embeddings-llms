To determine the access control level for the `stopOneTouchRecord` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `stopOneTouchRecord` method involves setting the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, and then it creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$18` with parameters `p0` and `p1`. This instance is then run on the service thread. The key operation here seems to be related to managing or controlling HDMI services, specifically stopping a one-touch record operation.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code indicates interactions with `HdmiControlService`, setting work source UID, and executing a specific service-related task (`runOnServiceThread`).

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource()V**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It also interacts with `HdmiControlService` by setting the work source UID to the calling UID and running a service thread task. The similarity score is very high (0.9951607584953308), indicating that the operational context and possibly the security implications are closely related to those of `stopOneTouchRecord`.
   - **startOneTouchRecord(I[B)V**: This API also has an access control level of `NONE`. Although its similarity score with `stopOneTouchRecord` is somewhat lower (0.8811576962471008), it still involves running a service thread task and interacts with HDMI control services.

Given these observations:
- All similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The operations involve managing HDMI services, which seem to be internal to the system's functionality rather than directly accessing sensitive user data or performing dangerous operations that could impact the system's security or privacy.
- There is no indication that these methods perform actions typically classified as `DANGEROUS` (e.g., accessing location, contacts, camera, microphone) or require special system permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG`).

Based on this analysis, it seems reasonable to conclude that the `stopOneTouchRecord` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`, as its operational context and security implications appear to align closely with those of the provided similar APIs.
