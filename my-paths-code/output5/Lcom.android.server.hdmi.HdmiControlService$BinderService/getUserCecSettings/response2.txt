To determine the access control level for the `getUserCecSettings` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of `getUserCecSettings`**:
   - This method retrieves user settings from the HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) configuration.
   - It uses `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` to set the work source UID to the calling UID, which is a way to attribute work (like network or disk I/O) to the correct UID for battery usage tracking and other purposes.
   - The method then clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`, retrieves the HDMI CEC configuration with `this.this$0.getHdmiCecConfig()`, gets user settings from this configuration, restores the calling identity, and returns these settings.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **`getActiveSource()`** has an access control level of `NONE`. This method seems to construct an `HdmiDeviceInfo` object based on the physical address of an active source without any explicit permission checks or sensitive data handling that would require a higher access control level.
   - **`accountAuthenticated(Account)`** has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permissions, likely due to its involvement in account authentication processes which are sensitive.

3. **Determining Access Control for `getUserCecSettings`**:
   - Given that `getUserCecSettings` deals with retrieving user settings related to HDMI CEC configurations, it doesn't explicitly handle sensitive information like account authentication or require system-level permissions based on the provided code snippet.
   - The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and restoring it suggests a careful handling of identities but does not inherently imply a need for elevated permissions in this context since it's about retrieving settings rather than performing actions that could compromise security or privacy.
   - Comparing with `getActiveSource()`, which has an access control level of `NONE` and also deals with HDMI-related information, suggests that `getUserCecSettings` might not require high-level permissions for its operation.

**Conclusion**: Given the nature of the `getUserCecSettings` method and comparing it with similar APIs, especially noting that it does not handle sensitive data or require system-level actions like `accountAuthenticated` does, but rather operates in a domain similar to `getActiveSource`, the access control level for `getUserCecSettings` can be considered as `NONE`. This is because it retrieves information without apparent implications on security, privacy, or system integrity that would necessitate higher access controls.
