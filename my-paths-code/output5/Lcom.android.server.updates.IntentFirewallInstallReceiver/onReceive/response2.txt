To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we should consider the provided information about similar APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and their code snippets are nearly identical to the one provided for the `onReceive` method, it suggests a pattern where this type of method does not require stringent access controls.

The code snippet for the `onReceive` method and its similar APIs involves creating an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and starting it. This action does not inherently suggest dangerous operations such as accessing sensitive user data, performing significant system changes, or requiring special permissions that would necessitate a higher access control level like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if we consider the context of these similarities.

Therefore, based on the similarity in code and function with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
