To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and their code snippets are almost identical to the one in the `onReceive` method.

Given this information:

* All similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.
* The code snippets of these similar APIs are nearly identical, involving the creation and starting of a `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` instance.
* There is no indication that the `onReceive` method interacts with sensitive data or performs actions that would require elevated permissions (such as those classified under `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if it involves less sensitive but still protected operations).

Based on this analysis, since the `onReceive` method's functionality and code structure are very similar to those of the APIs with an access control level of `NONE`, and without evidence suggesting it handles sensitive information or requires specific permissions beyond what is typical for such receiver methods, we can infer that its access control level should also be `NONE`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
