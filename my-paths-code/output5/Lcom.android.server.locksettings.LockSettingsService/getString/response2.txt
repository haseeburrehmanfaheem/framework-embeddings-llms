Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getString` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getString` method interacts with the `LockSettingsStorage` cache and the `SQLiteDatabase` to retrieve a string value. The sink code snippet shows that it accesses sensitive data, such as the lock screen password type, and stores it in the cache.

The similar APIs, `getCredentialType(I)I` and `getBoolean(Ljava/lang/String;ZI)Z`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with sensitive data, such as the synthetic password manager and lock pattern utilities.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `getString` method, it appears that they all handle sensitive data related to device security and authentication. The access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` is likely assigned to these methods because they require system or signature-level permissions to access and manipulate this sensitive data.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and the semantics of the `getString` method, I conclude that the appropriate access control level for the `original_method` API is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
