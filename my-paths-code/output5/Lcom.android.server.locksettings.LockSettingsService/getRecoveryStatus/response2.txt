To determine the access control level for the `getRecoveryStatus` method, let's analyze its code and the provided similar APIs along with their access control levels.

The `getRecoveryStatus` method performs the following operations:
1. It retrieves the calling user's ID using `Binder.getCallingUid()`.
2. It queries a database (`this.mKeyStoreDbHelper.getReadableDatabase()`) for keys based on the user's ID.
3. It iterates through the query results (if any) and constructs a map, which it then returns.

The sink code provided highlights interactions with the database, including querying it and potentially returning data from it.

Now, let's consider the similar APIs:
- `setRecoveryStatus(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method updates the recovery status in the database based on a provided user ID and alias. Despite interacting with sensitive data (recovery status), its access control level is `NONE`, suggesting that the system trusts the caller or that this operation does not pose significant security risks.
- `removeKey(Ljava/lang/String;)V` also has an access control level of `NONE`. This method removes a key from the database based on the user ID and alias, which involves modifying sensitive data. Again, its access control level is `NONE`, indicating similar trust or low-risk assumptions as with `setRecoveryStatus`.

Given that both similar APIs (`setRecoveryStatus` and `removeKey`) have an access control level of `NONE` despite their operations on potentially sensitive data, we can infer a few key points:
- The system seems to trust the callers of these methods or considers the risks associated with them as low.
- The operations (reading from and writing to the database) are common among these APIs, suggesting that the access control level might not be strictly based on the type of database operation but rather on the context and potential impact of the data being accessed.

However, `getRecoveryStatus` is a method that reads data from the database without modifying it. In general, read operations are considered less risky than write operations because they do not alter the system's state or user data directly.

Considering these points:
- The method does not modify any sensitive information; it only retrieves it.
- Similar methods that interact with the same database but perform modifications have an access control level of `NONE`.

Based on this analysis, assigning an access control level to `getRecoveryStatus` that is consistent with the provided similar APIs and considering the nature of its operations would lead us to conclude that it should also have a relatively low-risk access control level.

Therefore, given the information and the context provided by the similar APIs, the final access control level for the `getRecoveryStatus` API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This conclusion is drawn from the method's read-only nature and the precedent set by similar methods that have an access control level of `NONE`, despite their write operations on potentially sensitive data.
