Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `registerStrongAuthTracker` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `registerStrongAuthTracker` method sends a message to a handler with an `IStrongAuthTracker` object as an argument. The sink code is responsible for sending this message to the target handler.

Looking at the similar APIs, we can see that they also send messages to handlers with different arguments and message codes. The `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` method has a similarity score of 0.9897 and an access control level of NONE, while the `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` method has a similarity score of 0.9882 and an access control level of NONE.

Given that these similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, it is likely that the `registerStrongAuthTracker` method also requires minimal or no access control. The method does not seem to perform any sensitive operations or interact with sensitive data, and its primary purpose is to register a strong auth tracker.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the method's code and its similar APIs, I assign an access control level of NONE to the `registerStrongAuthTracker` API.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
