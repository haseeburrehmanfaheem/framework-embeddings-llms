After reviewing the provided information, I will assign an access control level to the `removeKey` API.

The `removeKey` API is interacting with the same sink as the similar APIs (`SQLiteDatabase` and `ApplicationKeyStorage`). The API is deleting a key from the database based on the user ID and alias. 

Upon examining the code snippets of the `removeKey` API, it appears that the API is not performing any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions. However, it does interact with the `SQLiteDatabase`, which could potentially be used to access or modify sensitive data.

Comparing this API to the similar APIs (`setRecoveryStatus` and `getRecoveryStatus`), we see that they also interact with the `SQLiteDatabase` but have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that interacting with the database in this context does not necessarily require elevated permissions.

Given the information provided, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `removeKey` API. This is because the API is performing a relatively standard operation (deleting a key) and does not appear to be accessing or modifying sensitive data in a way that would require elevated permissions.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
