To determine the access control level for the `setBoolean` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The `setBoolean` method writes a boolean value to the lock settings storage using `LockSettingsStorage.writeKeyValue(p1, , p3);`. This operation is related to storing or modifying system settings that could potentially be security-sensitive, such as lock screen settings.

However, when comparing this with the provided similar APIs:

1. **setLong(Ljava/lang/String;JI)V**: This method also writes a value (a long integer) to `LockSettingsStorage` using `LockSettingsStorage.writeKeyValue(p1, v3, p3);`. It has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that writing such settings is not considered dangerous or requiring special permissions in the context provided.

2. **setString(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)V**: This method writes a string value to the lock settings storage using a slightly different approach (`SQLiteDatabase v5 = this.mOpenHelper.getWritableDatabase();` followed by `LockSettingsStorage.writeKeyValue(v5, p1, p2, p3);`). It also has an access control level of `NONE`.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that the operations performed by these methods (including writing to lock settings storage) are not deemed to require elevated permissions or pose significant security risks in their respective contexts.

The sink code `['LockSettingsStorage.writeKeyValue(p1, , p3);']` indicates a write operation to system settings, but without additional context suggesting this is particularly sensitive (e.g., requiring special system or signature-level permissions), we lean on the similarity with other methods that perform comparable operations without elevated access control.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the behavior of similar APIs, the `setBoolean` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`, as it does not appear to pose a significant risk or require special system permissions beyond what is typical for such setting modifications.
