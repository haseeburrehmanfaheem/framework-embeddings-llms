Based on the provided information, we need to determine the access control level for the `getBoolean` method. 

The method interacts with sensitive data such as lock settings and synthetic password states. The sink code also involves reading persistent data blocks and loading state from the SyntheticPasswordManager.

Looking at the similar APIs:

1. `getCredentialType(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.8876374959945679 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with lock settings and synthetic password states, suggesting that it requires a high level of access control.

2. `getLong(Ljava/lang/String;JI)J` has a similarity score of 0.817334771156311 and an access control level of `NONE`. However, this API seems to be reading legacy lock pattern settings, which might not be as sensitive as the data accessed by the `getBoolean` method.

Considering the similarities with `getCredentialType(I)I` and the sensitive nature of the data accessed, it is likely that the `getBoolean` method requires a similar level of access control.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
