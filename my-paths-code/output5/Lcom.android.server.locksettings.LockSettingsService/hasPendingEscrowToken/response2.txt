To determine the access control level for the `hasPendingEscrowToken` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method checks if a pending escrow token exists for a given integer parameter `p1`. It uses an internal `tokenMap` to store and retrieve tokens based on the input parameter. The logic involves checking if the key (derived from `p1`) is present in the map and then verifying if there are any elements associated with this key.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided shows operations related to converting the input integer to an `Integer` object, checking for the presence of a key in `tokenMap`, creating an `ArraySet`, and retrieving values from `tokenMap`. These operations do not directly indicate any sensitive or dangerous actions that would typically require higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **removeWeakEscrowToken(JI)Z**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to the removal operation on potentially sensitive data stored in `tokenMap`.
   - **addWeakEscrowToken([BILcom/android/internal/widget/IWeakEscrowTokenActivatedListener;)J**: Also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method involves adding a new token, which could be related to security or system-level functionality.

Given these points, the `hasPendingEscrowToken` method seems less intrusive compared to `removeWeakEscrowToken` and `addWeakEscrowToken`. It does not modify any data but rather checks for the existence of a pending escrow token. This kind of read-only operation typically requires less stringent access control.

However, considering it interacts with the same `tokenMap` as the other two methods, which have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their potential implications on system security or functionality, one might argue that `hasPendingEscrowToken` could also require a certain level of protection. Yet, since it's merely a check and does not modify any data, it seems less critical than the operations performed by its similar APIs.

Given these considerations, but also acknowledging the importance of securing interactions with potentially sensitive system components (like `tokenMap`), the access control level might lean towards requiring some form of protection. However, without explicit indications of danger or modifications to sensitive data, the most fitting choice seems to be `NORMAL`, as it reflects a need for basic security precautions without elevating to system or signature level requirements.

Therefore, based on the analysis and considering the balance between security needs and the nature of the operation performed by `hasPendingEscrowToken`, the access control level should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice aims to protect against unauthorized access while recognizing that this method does not perform dangerous operations or directly modify sensitive system data.
