To determine the access control level for the `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` method sends a message to a handler with a specific code (in this case, `3`) and an object (`p1`) of type `IStrongAuthTracker`. This action seems to be related to managing or tracking strong authentication mechanisms.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **registerStrongAuthTracker**: This API has a high similarity score with `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Its functionality involves registering a strong auth tracker, which is essentially the opposite action of unregistering but within the same domain of managing strong authentication trackers.
   - **scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout**: Although its similarity score is slightly lower than that of `registerStrongAuthTracker`, it still shares a significant resemblance in terms of sending messages via a handler. This method's access control level is also `NONE`, and it deals with scheduling timeouts for non-strong biometric authentication, which can be seen as part of the broader authentication management system.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering their functional proximity to the `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` method (all deal with aspects of authentication management), it suggests that `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` does not require elevated permissions or special access rights.
   - The operations involved do not seem to directly interact with sensitive user data, critical system resources, or functions that would typically require higher levels of access control like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if we consider the context of these specific APIs.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` method should have an access control level similar to its counterparts, which do not pose significant risks or require special permissions beyond what is considered standard or basic.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
