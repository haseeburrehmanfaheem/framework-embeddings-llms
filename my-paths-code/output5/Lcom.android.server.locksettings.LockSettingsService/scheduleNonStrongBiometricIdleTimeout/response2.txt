To determine the access control level for the `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs provided.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` takes an integer parameter `p1` and uses it to obtain a message from `this.mHandler` with the identifier `9`, and then sends this message to its target. This operation involves internal handling of messages within the system, which typically does not directly access sensitive user data or perform actions that require high-level permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code is essentially part of the method's implementation where it obtains a message and sends it to its target. This action is similar to what is seen in the provided similar APIs and does not inherently suggest a need for elevated access control, as it's more about internal communication rather than direct interaction with sensitive resources.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The API `registerStrongAuthTracker` has an access control level of `NONE`. Its operation involves sending a message to a handler upon registering a strong authentication tracker, which is similar in nature (message passing) but different in purpose.
   - The API `reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock` also has an access control level of `NONE`. It reports the success of a biometric unlock, again involving internal message handling.

Given these points:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that their operations are considered to not require significant protection or elevation of privileges.
- The nature of the operation in `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` (sending a message internally) is comparable and does not suggest interaction with sensitive data or actions that would necessitate higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if we consider the pattern from similar APIs.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the method's code, its sink, and the comparison with provided similar APIs (all having an access control level of `NONE`), it is reasonable to conclude that the `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.
