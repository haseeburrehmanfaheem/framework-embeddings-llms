Based on the provided code for the `requireStrongAuth` API with depth 1, let's analyze it according to the given rules:

- The method `obtainMessage` is invoked within the API. It has no naming similarity with `requireStrongAuth`, but it processes the input parameters `p1` and `p2`. This meets one of the positive rules for identifying potential sinks.
- A new `Message` object (`v3`) is created using the outputs of `obtainMessage`, which involves the API's input parameters. However, `obtainMessage` itself doesn't directly create a new object with data flow from the API parameters; instead, it returns an existing message that is then sent.
- The method `sendToTarget()` is invoked on the `v3` object, which is a continuation of the processing initiated by `requireStrongAuth`. This also follows one of the positive rules because it involves further action based on the created or obtained `Message` object.

Given these points, we can identify a potential sink set within this API. Here's how we could represent it in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Message v3 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1, p1, p2);",
      "v3.sendToTarget();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This representation captures the sequence of instructions that contribute to a potential sink within the `requireStrongAuth` API. The creation and sending of the message (`v3`) are directly linked through their use of input parameters (`p1`, `p2`) and their contribution to the method's overall functionality, thus forming a coherent set of instructions for a potential sink.
