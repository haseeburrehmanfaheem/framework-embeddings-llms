To assign an access control level to the `getMaximumDataBlockSize` method, we must analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of `getMaximumDataBlockSize`:**
   - The method checks if the calling UID (`v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();`) matches `this.mAllowedUid`. If they don't match, it proceeds to calculate a value based on the block device size obtained from `PersistentDataBlockService.getBlockDeviceSize()`.
   - The calculation involves subtracting several constants from the block device size and checking if the result is less than 102400. If true, it returns a calculated value (`v4`).
   - This method interacts with system-level data (block device size) but does not seem to modify any sensitive data directly.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`getOemUnlockEnabled()Z`** has an access control level of `NONE`. It reads from a file related to the OEM unlock state and checks a byte value. The similarity in accessing system-level information (file input stream) is noted, but the nature of data accessed differs.
   - **`getDataBlockSize()I`** has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires signature or system-level permission. This method directly returns the total data size locked, which involves system-level data handling similar to `getMaximumDataBlockSize`.

3. **Access Control Decision:**
   - Given that `getMaximumDataBlockSize` handles system-level data (block device size) and performs calculations based on this sensitive information without modifying it, we need to consider if it requires protection.
   - The method's interaction with system-level data suggests a need for some level of access control. However, the exact nature of the calculation and return value doesn't directly indicate a modification or exposure of highly sensitive data that would necessitate `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` levels strictly based on provided information.
   - The similarity score with `getOemUnlockEnabled()` (NONE) might suggest a less restrictive approach, but considering the system-level data handling and for caution, we lean towards ensuring some protection is in place.

**Conclusion:**
Given the method's behavior and comparison with similar APIs, especially noting its interaction with system-level data without clear indication of modifying sensitive information or requiring explicit signature/system permissions like `getDataBlockSize()I`, a moderate approach seems appropriate. However, considering the potential for this method to be used in contexts that could impact system functionality or security indirectly (e.g., through denial-of-service by exhausting resources or informing about system capacity), assigning it an access control level of `NORMAL` seems prudent. This reflects a balance between allowing legitimate use while encouraging developers to consider the implications of their code on system resources and security.
