To determine the access control level for the `getFontConfig` method, we should consider the following factors based on the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**: Both similar APIs (`updateFontFamily`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to font configuration and management are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.

2. **Code Semantics and Sinks**:
   - The `getFontConfig` method interacts with system font configurations, reads from specific XML files (`/system/etc/fonts.xml`, `/product/etc/fonts_customization.xml`), and directories (`/system/fonts/`, `/product/fonts/`). This indicates that it deals with system-level resources.
   - The method also involves the application of a config supplier and the reading of persistent system font configurations, which implies handling of potentially sensitive or system-critical data.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Implies no specific permissions are required, which seems inappropriate given the method's interaction with system resources.
   - `NORMAL`: Suggests that the method can be accessed with normal permissions but doesn't imply the level of sensitivity or system-level interaction observed in the provided code snippets.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Indicates a higher level of risk or sensitivity, which might not fully align with the method's purpose of retrieving font configurations without explicit modification of sensitive data.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Requires system or signature-level permissions, aligning with the observed interactions with system resources and configurations.

Considering these factors, especially the similar APIs' access control levels (`SYS_OR_SIG`) and the nature of the code (interacting with system fonts and configurations), it's reasonable to conclude that the `getFontConfig` method should have an access control level that reflects its need for system-level permissions due to its interaction with sensitive system resources.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination is based on the method's involvement in system font configurations and the precedent set by similar APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.
