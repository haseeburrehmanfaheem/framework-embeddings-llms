Since both paths have the same code and there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules, there are no potential sinks in this API. 

The if statement and return instruction do not contribute to a sink as they are part of control flow and do not directly interact with sensitive data.

Here is the JSON output:
```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
