Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getUserData` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getUserData` method interacts with sensitive data, such as user accounts and their associated keys. It also performs database queries using `SQLiteDatabase`. The method's logic involves checking the account type, verifying the caller's user ID, and retrieving data from the cache or database.

The similar APIs provided, `getPassword` and `addAccountExplicitlyWithVisibility`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with sensitive data and perform database operations. The similarity scores between these APIs and `getUserData` are relatively high (0.9161712527275085 and 0.8880590200424194, respectively), indicating that they share similar functionality and characteristics.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the sensitive nature of the data being handled, I conclude that the `getUserData` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This level is typically assigned to methods that require system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive data or perform critical operations.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
