Based on the provided information and code snippets, I will analyze the `getAccountsByFeatures` method to determine its access control level.

The `getAccountsByFeatures` method interacts with sensitive data, such as account information and features, which suggests that it requires a certain level of access control. The method's code snippets show that it uses various classes and methods related to account management, authentication, and caching.

Upon examining the similar APIs provided, I notice that both `startUpdateCredentialsSession` and `hasFeatures` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with account-related data and use similar classes and methods, such as `IAccountAuthenticatorCache` and `AuthenticatorDescription`.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getAccountsByFeatures` method, I conclude that the access control level for `getAccountsByFeatures` should be consistent with the others.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getAccountsByFeatures` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is based on the similarities in code structure and functionality between `getAccountsByFeatures` and the provided similar APIs, which suggests that they require comparable levels of access control to protect sensitive account-related data.
