Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeAccountExplicitly` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeAccountExplicitly` method appears to be related to account management, specifically removing an account explicitly. The method calls `removeAccountInternal`, which suggests that it has some internal logic for removing accounts.

The similar API, `someUserHasAccount`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission. This API seems to be checking if a user has a specific account.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and their purposes, I would argue that the `removeAccountExplicitly` method also requires a similar level of access control. The method is modifying account information, which is a sensitive operation that should be restricted to system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `removeAccountExplicitly` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "DANGEROUS"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method poses a potential risk to the user's data or system security and should be restricted accordingly. The `DANGEROUS` level is more suitable than `SYS_OR_SIG` since it's not exclusively limited to system or signature-level permissions but still acknowledges the potential risks associated with this operation.
