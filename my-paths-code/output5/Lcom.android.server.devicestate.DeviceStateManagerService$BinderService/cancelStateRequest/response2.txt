To determine the access control level for the `cancelStateRequest` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `cancelStateRequest` method has two paths with depth 2, but both paths have similar logic. The method checks if a process record exists for a given key (`p2`). If no record is found, it performs an action on the `mActiveOverride` object using a lambda function.

The sink code provided shows that the method interacts with `this.mProcessRecords` and `this.mOverrideRequestController`, which are also present in the similar APIs.

Now, let's compare the `cancelStateRequest` method with the similar APIs:

1. `requestState(Landroid/os/IBinder;II)V`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It checks if a process record exists and then adds a new request to the `mOverrideRequestController`.
2. `requestBaseStateOverride(Landroid/os/IBinder;II)V`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It checks if a process record exists and then adds a new base state request to the `mOverrideRequestController`.

Both similar APIs have a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`) because they modify the state of the device by adding new requests. In contrast, the `cancelStateRequest` method seems to be canceling an existing request, which might not require the same level of access control.

However, considering that the `cancelStateRequest` method still interacts with sensitive objects like `mProcessRecords` and `mOverrideRequestController`, it's likely that some level of access control is required.

Given the similarities with the other APIs and the potential impact on device state, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `cancelStateRequest` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that only system or signature-privileged applications can call this method, preventing unauthorized modifications to the device's state.
