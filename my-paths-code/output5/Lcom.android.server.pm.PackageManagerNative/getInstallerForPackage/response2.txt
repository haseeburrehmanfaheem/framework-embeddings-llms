To assign an access control level to the `getInstallerForPackage` method, we need to consider its functionality and how it interacts with system resources. The method retrieves the installer package name for a given package, which involves accessing package information managed by the PackageManagerService.

Given the provided code snippets and sink information, here are key points to analyze:

1. **Access to Package Information**: The method accesses package information through `PackageManagerService$Snapshot` and `ComputerEngine`. This access is similar to what is seen in the provided similar APIs (`getAllPackages()`), which have an access control level of `NONE`.

2. **Interaction with Sensitive Data**: While the method does interact with system-level data (package installers), it does so in a manner that is consistent with retrieving publicly accessible package information, similar to how `getAllPackages()` operates.

3. **Security Implications**: The security implications of accessing the installer package name for an application are relatively low compared to operations like installing or deleting packages, which would require higher access control levels (e.g., `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`). The method does not modify system state in a significant way; it merely retrieves existing information.

4. **Comparison with Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs provided (`getAllPackages()`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that retrieving package-related information, even if it involves accessing system-managed data structures, does not inherently require elevated permissions in this context.

5. **Lack of Elevated Permission Requirements**: There's no indication from the code snippets or the description that the `getInstallerForPackage` method requires special or elevated permissions beyond what is typical for accessing basic package information.

Based on these considerations and the fact that similar APIs (`getAllPackages()`) are assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getInstallerForPackage` method does not necessitate a higher access control level than `NONE`.

**Access Control Level Decision:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision reflects the understanding that accessing package installer information, as performed by `getInstallerForPackage`, aligns with the access patterns and security implications of similar APIs in the system, which do not require elevated permissions.
