To determine the access control level for the `getVersionCodeForPackage` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs provided are both named `getAllPackages()` and have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods interact with package management functionality but do not directly deal with version code retrieval or sensitive operations that would require higher access control levels.
   - Despite the difference in their primary function (retrieving all packages vs. getting a specific package's version code), they share similarities in how they access and manipulate package-related data through `PackageManagerService$Snapshot` and `ComputerEngine`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves getting the calling UID, user ID, accessing snapshots, creating new instances of `PackageManagerService$Snapshot`, and using `ComputerEngine`. These operations are related to managing packages and do not inherently suggest a need for elevated permissions.
   - However, the presence of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `UserHandle.getUserId(v1)` suggests that the method is aware of and interacts with user-level data, which might imply some level of access control.

3. **Method Code Analysis**:
   - The `getVersionCodeForPackage` method involves complex logic for managing snapshots, rebuilding statistics, and ensuring thread safety through locks.
   - It retrieves package information based on the provided package name (`p1`) and returns the version code. This operation seems to be focused on retrieving specific package metadata rather than performing actions that would directly impact system security or user data privacy.

Given these points:

- The method is primarily concerned with retrieving a package's version code, which does not inherently require sensitive permissions.
- Similar APIs (`getAllPackages()`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to package management do not necessarily require elevated access control levels.
- The presence of user ID and UID retrieval suggests awareness of the caller but does not directly imply a need for a high access control level in this context, as the operation is more about information retrieval than modification or sensitive data exposure.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's functionality, similar APIs, and the nature of operations performed, it appears that `getVersionCodeForPackage` should have an access control level that reflects its relatively benign and informative purpose. Thus, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NONE`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar package management APIs and does not involve sensitive or dangerous operations.
