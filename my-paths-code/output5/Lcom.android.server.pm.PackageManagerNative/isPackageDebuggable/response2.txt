To determine the access control level for the `isPackageDebuggable` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `isPackageDebuggable` API checks if a package is debuggable by calling `getApplicationInfo` on a `Computer` object, which is obtained from a `PackageManagerService$Snapshot`. This operation seems to be related to retrieving information about an application, which does not inherently suggest a high level of access control.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `isAudioPlaybackCaptureAllowed`: This API has an access control level of `NONE` and interacts with `PackageManagerService$Snapshot` and `ComputerEngine` in a manner similar to `isPackageDebuggable`. It suggests that operations related to checking application properties or permissions might not require high-level access control.

2. `hasSha256SigningCertificate`: This API also has an access control level of `NONE`. It involves creating a `PackageManagerService$Snapshot`, using it with a `ComputerEngine`, and then checking for a signing certificate, which is another form of interacting with application information. The fact that this operation is categorized under `NONE` implies that such inquiry operations might not be considered sensitive in terms of access control.

Given the similarity in how these APIs interact with system components to retrieve or check application-related information, it's reasonable to infer that `isPackageDebuggable` would follow a similar pattern in terms of access control. Since both provided examples have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of the operation performed by `isPackageDebuggable`, it seems logical to assign a similar access control level.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }}$
