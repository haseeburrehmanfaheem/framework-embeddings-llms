Based on the provided code for the API `notifyResourceGranted`, I have identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. Here are the results in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "Object v17 = v16.getSystemService(UserManage.class);",
            "List v18 = v17.getEnabledProfiles();"
        ],
        [
            "Intent v20 = new Intent(\"android.intent.action.MEDIA_RESOURCE_GRANTED\");",
            "Intent v22 = v20.putExtra(\"android.intent.extra.PACKAGES\", v12);",
            "Intent v23 = v20.putExtra(\"android.intent.extra.MEDIA_RESOURCE_TYPE\", p2);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink array includes instructions that access a field (`getSystemService`) with naming similarity to the API name, and its return value is used in subsequent instructions. Although `UserManage.class` does not directly follow the naming convention of `notifyResourceGranted`, it is still relevant due to the method invocation rule.
2. The second sink array involves creating a new object (`Intent`) that propagates data from the API parameters (`p2`). Additionally, `v12` (not defined in this snippet but presumably related to the input or internal state) is used as an extra in the intent. This satisfies multiple positive rules: object creation with naming similarity and data flow from API parameters.

These sinks are ranked based on their sensitivity, with the first sink being more sensitive due to its direct interaction with system services and potential access to user profiles, which can be considered more critical than intent creation and modification.
