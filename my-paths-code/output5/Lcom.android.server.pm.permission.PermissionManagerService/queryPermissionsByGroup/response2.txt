To assign an access control level to the `queryPermissionsByGroup` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method has two paths with depth 0, both of which return a `ParceledListSlice`. 
   - In path 1, it returns 0 if a certain condition (`v1 != 0`) is not met.
   - In path 2, under the same condition, it creates a new `ParceledListSlice` object with `v1` and returns this object.
   - The sink code involves creating a `ParceledListSlice` object and returning it.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getAllPermissionGroups` and `getAllPendingJobs`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - These APIs also return `ParceledListSlice` objects, created in a manner similar to the sink code of `queryPermissionsByGroup`.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - The method `queryPermissionsByGroup` seems to be querying and returning information related to permissions by group, which is a sensitive operation but based on the provided similar APIs and their access control levels, it does not seem to pose an immediate danger or require special system or signal privileges.
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of `queryPermissionsByGroup` (which involves querying permission groups), it suggests that this operation might not be classified under `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, but rather something more benign.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, since both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the nature of the operation performed by `queryPermissionsByGroup`, it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level to this method.
   - The operation does not seem to directly pose significant risks or require system-level privileges that would classify it as `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these considerations, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
