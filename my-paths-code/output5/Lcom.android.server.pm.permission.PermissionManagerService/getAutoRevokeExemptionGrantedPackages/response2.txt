To determine the access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet shows that this method iterates over all installed packages using `forEachInstalledPackage` and filters them based on a certain condition (related to auto-revoke exemption) via a lambda expression (`PermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`). It collects the packages that meet the condition in an `ArrayList` and returns this list.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code essentially performs the same operations as described in the code snippet, focusing on creating a list of packages that are granted auto-revoke exemptions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - A highly similar API (`getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages`) with a similarity score of 0.9997791051864624 is provided. This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code for this similar API is almost identical to the one in question, differing only by the integer parameter passed to the lambda expression (1 vs. 2), which likely corresponds to different filtering conditions based on the auto-revoke exemption status.

Given these points:

- **Access Control Decision**: Since the provided API (`getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages`) and its highly similar counterpart (`getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages`) perform closely related operations (both dealing with auto-revoke exemptions but presumably for different statuses), and considering that the latter has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to infer that `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` should have a similar access control requirement. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically implies that the method can be invoked by system processes or applications signed with the platform key, reflecting its potential sensitivity and need for restriction.

- **Conclusion**: Given the similarity in functionality, code structure, and the sensitive nature of package management and permission handling, it's logical to assign `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` an access control level that matches its similar counterpart.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
