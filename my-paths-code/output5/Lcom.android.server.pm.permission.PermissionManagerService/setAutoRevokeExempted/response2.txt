To determine the access control level for the `setAutoRevokeExempted` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `setAutoRevokeExempted` method involves several key operations:
   - It checks if the caller is the installer of record for the given package.
   - It performs an AppOps check using `checkOpNoThrow(98, v9, v10)`, which suggests it's interacting with app operations that could be sensitive.
   - Based on the result, it sets a mode using `mAppOpsManager.setMode(97, v9, v13, ...)`, indicating a potential change in app operation settings.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **isAutoRevokeExempted**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also involves checking the caller's relationship to the package (`isCallerInstallerOfRecord`) and performs AppOps checks. The similarity in functionality (dealing with auto-revoke exemptions) and the involvement of sensitive operations suggest a potentially similar access control requirement.
   - **getVersionCodeForPackage**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. However, its functionality is quite different as it primarily deals with retrieving package information without modifying any settings or performing sensitive operations. This makes it less relevant for determining the access control level of `setAutoRevokeExempted`.

Given these observations:
- The method interacts with sensitive app operations (e.g., checking and setting modes via AppOpsManager).
- It requires the caller to be the installer of record for the package or passes through a check that suggests elevated privileges might be necessary (`isCallerInstallerOfRecord` and AppOps checks).
- The similar API `isAutoRevokeExempted` with a high similarity score has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that operations related to auto-revoke exemptions may require system or signature-level permissions.

**Conclusion**: Considering the sensitive nature of the operations performed by `setAutoRevokeExempted`, its similarity to `isAutoRevokeExempted`, and the need for elevated privileges (as suggested by checks like `isCallerInstallerOfRecord`), it's reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects the potential risks associated with modifying app operation settings.

**Access Control Level**: Given the analysis, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`, reflecting the need for system or signature-level permissions to perform such operations securely.
