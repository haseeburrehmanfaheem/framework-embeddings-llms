To determine the access control level for the `getSplitPermissions` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `getPermissionGroupInfo(Ljava/lang/String;I)Landroid/content/pm/PermissionGroupInfo;` with an Access Control Level of `NONE`.
2. `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions(Ljava/lang/String;II)Ljava/util/List;` with an Access Control Level of `NONE`.

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not pose a significant risk in terms of sensitive data exposure or system integrity compromise. The code snippets for these APIs and the `getSplitPermissions` method are also simple, returning a value directly without any complex operations or interactions with potentially sensitive resources.

Given this information:

- The `getSplitPermissions` method returns a list (`v1`) directly without any additional processing that could introduce security risks.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that the operation of returning permissions or permission-related information does not inherently require higher access control levels unless it involves sensitive data handling or system modifications.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its operation (returning a list directly), the `getSplitPermissions` method should have an access control level that reflects minimal risk, similar to its counterparts.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
