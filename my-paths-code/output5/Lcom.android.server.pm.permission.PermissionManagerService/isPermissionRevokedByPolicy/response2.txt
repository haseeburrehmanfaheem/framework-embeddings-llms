To determine the access control level for the `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics and functionality implied by the name and parameters of `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy`.

1. **Similarity with `clearNotificationEffects()`**: This API has a high similarity score but is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. The `SYS_OR_SIG` level typically implies that the method can only be called by system processes or applications signed with the platform key, suggesting it involves sensitive operations or affects system-wide settings.

2. **Similarity with `addOnPermissionsChangeListener`**: This API also has a high similarity score but is assigned `NONE` access control level. The `NONE` level indicates that no specific permissions are required to call this method, suggesting it does not directly manipulate sensitive data or perform critical operations.

Given these similarities and access control levels:
- **Semantic Analysis of `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy`**: This method checks if a permission has been revoked by policy. It involves querying the state of a permission, which is a sensitive operation as it deals with security settings. However, checking the status does not inherently modify system settings or user data; it's more about retrieving information regarding the current state of permissions.

Considering these points:
- The method does not seem to directly manipulate sensitive data but rather retrieves information.
- It's related to permission management, which is a critical aspect of Android security.
- The similar APIs suggest both low-risk (`addOnPermissionsChangeListener`) and high-risk (`clearNotificationEffects`) operations are possible with high similarity scores.

Given the nature of `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy`, it seems more aligned with operations that require some level of access control due to its relation to permission management, but it does not necessarily imply a modification of system settings or sensitive data. Thus, it doesn't clearly fit into the `SYS_OR_SIG` category based solely on the information given.

However, considering standard practices in Android for methods that deal with permissions and their states, such operations are typically protected to ensure that only authorized components can query or modify permission statuses. Since `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` is about querying a status rather than modifying it, and without explicit evidence that it directly impacts system integrity or sensitive data, the most appropriate access control level might lean towards requiring some form of authorization but not necessarily at the system or signature level.

Given these considerations and aiming for a cautious approach to security:
- The method involves checking permission states, which is crucial for security.
- It does not clearly indicate it modifies system settings or directly accesses sensitive data.

Thus, assigning an access control level based on the provided information and similarities might suggest `NORMAL` as a reasonable choice. This is because `NORMAL` implies some form of protection (e.g., permissions) is required to call the method, acknowledging its involvement in security-related queries without necessitating system or signature-level access.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision balances the need for access control with the nature of the operation (querying permission status), which is important but may not require the highest level of protection (SYS_OR_SIG) or no protection at all (NONE).
