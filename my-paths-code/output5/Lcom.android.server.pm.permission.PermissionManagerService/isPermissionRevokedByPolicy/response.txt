Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that follow any of the positive rules, and given that `v1` is not defined within this snippet, it's challenging to directly apply the rules without more context. However, based on the information provided:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    []
  ]
}
```

This response reflects that there are no identifiable sinks within the provided code snippet according to the specified positive and negative rules, primarily due to a lack of detail about `v1` and its relation to any potential sink criteria.
