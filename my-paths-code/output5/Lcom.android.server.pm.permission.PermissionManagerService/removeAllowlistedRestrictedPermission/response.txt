Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public boolean removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission(String p1, String p2, int p3, int p4){
    return v1;
}
```

There are no explicit method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that directly relate to the input parameters `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`. The variable `v1` is returned but its origin and relation to the input parameters are unknown from this snippet alone.

However, since there's no clear indication of how `v1` is determined or if it directly relates to any sensitive operation involving the input parameters, we cannot confidently identify a sink based on the positive rules provided. The return statement itself does not follow any of the positive rules without additional context about `v1`.

Given this, and adhering strictly to the format requested for identifying sinks:

```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```

This response reflects that there are no identifiable sinks in the given code snippet based on the information provided.
