Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules in this API, and given the lack of context about what `v1` represents (it could be a variable set elsewhere in the class), we can't definitively identify any sinks based on the information provided. However, considering the return statement and assuming `v1` is related to the permission info being requested (thus having naming similarity with the API's purpose or processing input parameters indirectly through its initialization), it might still be considered under certain interpretations.

Given this limited context, a cautious approach would be to consider the return statement as potentially relevant, but without clear evidence of data flow from the parameters `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` directly influencing the creation or modification of `v1` within this snippet, we cannot confidently assert it follows the positive rules.

If we were to speculate on the basis that `v1`'s value is influenced by the API's parameters (not shown in this snippet), then:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "return v1;"
    ]
]
}
```

However, please note this interpretation assumes a connection between `v1` and the input parameters not explicitly shown in the provided code. Without additional context or evidence of such a connection, it's challenging to assert this as a definitive sink based on the rules provided.
