To determine the access control level for the `getPermissionInfo` method, we should consider its similarity to other APIs that interact with permission information and their assigned access control levels.

Given that the two similar APIs, `getPermissionGroupInfo` and `getSplitPermissions`, both have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that accessing or retrieving information about permissions does not inherently require a higher level of access control in this context. These methods are primarily focused on retrieving information rather than performing actions that could potentially harm the system or violate user privacy.

The `getPermissionInfo` method, by its name and the provided code snippet, appears to be designed to retrieve specific details about a permission based on input parameters (e.g., permission name, package name, and possibly flags indicated by an integer). Since it's similar in nature to the other two methods that have been assigned `NONE` as their access control level, and considering there's no indication of dangerous operations being performed (such as modifying system settings, accessing sensitive user data without consent, or performing actions that require special permissions), it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getPermissionInfo` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
