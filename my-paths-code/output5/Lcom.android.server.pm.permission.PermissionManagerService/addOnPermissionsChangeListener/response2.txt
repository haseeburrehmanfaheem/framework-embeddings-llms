To determine the access control level for the `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet of `addOnPermissionsChangeListener`:** The method is defined as `public void addOnPermissionsChangeListener(IOnPermissionsChangeListener p1){ return; }`. This indicates that it takes an interface listener as a parameter and does not seem to perform any significant operations itself, as it simply returns without executing any other statements.

2. **Sink Code:** There's no specific sink code provided for this method, which might imply that the method doesn't directly interact with sensitive data or operations typically associated with higher levels of access control (like file I/O, network communications, etc.).

3. **Similar APIs:**
   - **`clearNotificationEffects()V`:** This API has a similarity score of 1.0000001192092896 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The high similarity suggests that both methods might be related in terms of functionality or usage context, potentially implying system-level operations or significant permission requirements.
   - **`isPermissionRevokedByPolicy(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)Z`:** With the same high similarity score but an access control level of `NONE`, this method seems to query a state without directly altering it, suggesting it might not require elevated permissions.

Given these points:

- The lack of substantial operation within `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` itself (it simply returns without executing further code) suggests that its direct impact is minimal.
- The high similarity with `clearNotificationEffects()V`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, could imply a need for system-level access or significant permissions, especially if these methods are used in contexts requiring such privileges.
- However, the absence of specific sink code and the method's seemingly passive nature (adding a listener) might not align with operations that directly manipulate sensitive data or require dangerous permissions.

Considering these factors, it seems there might be an inclination towards `SYS_OR_SIG` due to the similarity with `clearNotificationEffects()V`, but without explicit evidence of direct interaction with sensitive operations or data within the provided code snippet and sink information, this could be a less clear-cut decision. The actual choice depends on understanding the context in which these methods are used, especially considering Android's permission model.

Given the information and focusing strictly on the method's apparent functionality (adding a listener) without direct manipulation of sensitive resources or explicit dangerous operations indicated:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This choice leans towards caution given the provided details but acknowledges that in real-world scenarios, context plays a crucial role. The decision could be influenced by how these methods are actually utilized within the broader application framework and Android's security model.
