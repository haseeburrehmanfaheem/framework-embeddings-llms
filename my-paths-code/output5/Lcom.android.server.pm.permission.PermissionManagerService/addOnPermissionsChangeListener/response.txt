Here's the analysis of the provided code snippet:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    []
]
}
```
The reason there are no sinks identified in this case is that the method `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` does not perform any operations that would qualify as a sink according to the given rules. It simply returns without executing any meaningful instructions, and thus, there's no data flow or method invocation that could be considered sensitive. The input parameter `p1` of type `IOnPermissionsChangeListener` is not used within the method, which means it does not contribute to any potential sinks.
