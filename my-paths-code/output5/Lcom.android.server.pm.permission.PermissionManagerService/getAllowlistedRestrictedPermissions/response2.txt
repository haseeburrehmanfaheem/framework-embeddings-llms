To determine the access control level for the `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method, we should consider its similarity to other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `getPermissionGroupInfo` and `getSplitPermissions`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given that:
- The `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method returns a list (`List`) based on input parameters, which is a common operation for retrieving information.
- Both similar APIs (`getPermissionGroupInfo` and `getSplitPermissions`) return specific types of information (`PermissionGroupInfo` and `List`, respectively) without any indication of performing sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions (like those classified as `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if it involves user-private data).
- The method's operation is to retrieve allowlisted restricted permissions, which implies accessing a list of permissions but does not inherently suggest modifying system settings, accessing sensitive user data, or performing actions that would typically be classified as dangerous or requiring special system or signature-level access.

Based on these considerations and the provided similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method also does not require any specific permissions beyond what is normally available to apps, thus not posing a risk that would necessitate higher access control levels.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
