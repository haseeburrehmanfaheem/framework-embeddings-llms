To determine the access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet for `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` involves creating an `ArrayList`, defining a lambda function (`PermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`) that interacts with the package manager to filter packages based on certain conditions (in this case, related to auto-revoke exemption requests), and then iterating over installed packages using `forEachInstalledPackage`. This process returns a list of packages that match the specified condition.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided essentially performs the same operations as described in the code snippet analysis, focusing on package iteration and filtering based on the lambda function's logic.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - A highly similar API, `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages`, with a similarity score of 0.9997791051864624, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also deals with auto-revoke exemptions but for granted packages instead of requested ones. The logic and structure are almost identical to the method in question, differing mainly in the lambda function's parameter (1 vs. 2), which likely influences the filtering condition.

Given these points, especially considering the high similarity score between `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` and `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages`, it is reasonable to infer that both methods operate within similar security contexts. The access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` for `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` suggests that these operations are either system-internal or require a specific signature-level permission, which aligns with the sensitive nature of managing package permissions and exemptions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity in functionality and implementation between the two methods, it is logical to conclude that `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
