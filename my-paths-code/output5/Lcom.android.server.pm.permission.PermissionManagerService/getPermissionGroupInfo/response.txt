Since there's no clear data flow or method invocations that follow the positive rules within this provided code snippet, and considering it seems to be a simplified representation without showing actual operations or interactions with `p1` and `p2`, we can infer that the return statement itself might represent a sink if `v1` somehow depends on the input parameters or has naming similarity with the API name. However, based solely on this snippet, there's not enough information to determine a clear data flow or dependency.

But assuming `v1` is indeed dependent on the operation of `getPermissionGroupInfo`, and considering the return value as part of the sink:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "return v1;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This represents the simplest form of a sink based on the information given, where `v1` is assumed to be the result of some operation influenced by `p1` and/or `p2`, or has a naming similarity that wasn't explicitly shown in this snippet. In real scenarios, more context would be necessary to accurately identify all potential sinks.
