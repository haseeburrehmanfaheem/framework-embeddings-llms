To determine the access control level for the `getPermissionGroupInfo` method, we should consider its functionality, the similarity with other provided APIs, and their assigned access control levels.

The `getPermissionGroupInfo` method takes a string and an integer as parameters and returns a `PermissionGroupInfo` object. This suggests it is involved in retrieving information about permission groups, which are related to how permissions are organized and managed within the Android system.

Given the similarity with `getSplitPermissions()` and `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions()`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`, we can infer several points:

1. **Similarity in Functionality**: All these methods seem to be involved in retrieving information related to permissions or permission management within the Android system.
2. **Return Type and Parameters**: While the return types and parameters might differ, their core functionality appears to be centered around querying or retrieving specific types of information without directly modifying system states that could pose significant risks.
3. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. This implies that they are not considered to pose a significant risk in terms of privacy, security, or system integrity.

Given these considerations, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getPermissionGroupInfo` method, similar to its counterparts, does not require elevated permissions or pose significant risks. Therefore, assigning an access control level of `NONE` seems appropriate, as it aligns with the treatment of similar methods within the Android framework.

{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
