Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method sends a message to a handler using `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget`, which is similar to the behavior of the two provided similar APIs: `requireStrongAuth` and `registerStrongAuthTracker`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

The similarity in code snippets between `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` and the two similar APIs suggests that they may be interacting with similar sinks, which in this case appears to be related to messaging and handling. The fact that all three methods use `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget` to send messages to a handler implies that they are likely performing internal communication or event handling within the system.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their assigned access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because there is no apparent indication of sensitive data being accessed or modified, nor is there any evidence of interactions with external entities that would require elevated permissions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
