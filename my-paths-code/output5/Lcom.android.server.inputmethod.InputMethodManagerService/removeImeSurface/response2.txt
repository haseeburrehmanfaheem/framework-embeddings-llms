To determine the access control level for the `removeImeSurface` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `removeImeSurface` method sends a message to a handler with the identifier `1060`. This operation does not directly interact with sensitive user data or perform actions that could potentially harm the system or violate privacy.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()V**: This API has an access control level of `NORMAL` and sends a message to a handler with the identifier `20`. The similarity in sending messages to handlers suggests that both methods are involved in internal communication or event handling within the application, which typically does not require high-level permissions.
   - **removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync(Landroid/os/IBinder;)V**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it likely does not handle sensitive information directly and is safe to use without specific permissions. It sends a message with an identifier `1061` and includes an `IBinder` object, which might imply interaction with another process or component, but still, its access control level is `NONE`.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - **NONE**: Typically for methods that do not pose a risk to the user's data or the system's integrity.
   - **NORMAL**: For methods that may have some implications on privacy or system behavior but are generally safe and do not require special permissions.
   - **DANGEROUS**: Methods that directly affect sensitive data, could cause financial loss, or compromise the user's privacy significantly.
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: Reserved for operations requiring system or signature-level permissions, indicating high risk or critical system operations.

Given these considerations:
- The `removeImeSurface` method does not seem to handle sensitive information directly nor perform actions that would be classified as dangerous or requiring special system permissions.
- Its closest similar APIs (`notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()` and `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync`) have access control levels of `NORMAL` and `NONE`, respectively. The operation of sending a message to a handler is common among these methods, suggesting internal communication rather than external, sensitive data handling.

Based on the analysis, since the method does not directly interact with sensitive user data or perform potentially harmful actions, but considering its similarity to other APIs that have been assigned `NORMAL` access control for slightly different but related operations, it's reasonable to conclude that `removeImeSurface` should be categorized as requiring `NONE` to `NORMAL` level of access control. However, given the specific nature of the provided information and focusing on the principle of least privilege (assigning the lowest level of access necessary), `NONE` seems more appropriate for `removeImeSurface` because it doesn't handle sensitive data or operations that would necessitate higher levels of access control.
