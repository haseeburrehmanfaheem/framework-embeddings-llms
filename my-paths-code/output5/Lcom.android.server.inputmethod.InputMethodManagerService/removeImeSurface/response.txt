Based on the provided code snippet for the `removeImeSurface` API, we can analyze it as follows:

1. The method `obtainMessage` is invoked on the `mHandler` object, which has a naming similarity with no direct relation to the API name but is used in conjunction with the API's parameters (none in this case). However, since `v2` directly influences the next instruction and considering the context of message handling, it can be seen as part of the data flow.

2. The method `sendToTarget` on `v2` is then invoked, which processes the message obtained earlier. This does not follow any direct naming similarity with the API but continues the data flow started by obtaining a message.

Given these points and the rules for identifying sinks:

- There's no field access or update that matches our criteria.
- The creation of a new object (`Message v2`) could be considered under the positive rule if we consider it in the context of being used with other sink cases, but here it directly influences another instruction.

Thus, considering the flow and how data propagates from one instruction to the next (even though there are no direct parameters or field accesses that fit our criteria perfectly), we can still identify a coherent set of instructions contributing to what could be considered a sink in terms of control flow through message handling:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Message v2 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1060);",
      "v2.sendToTarget();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This represents the sequence where obtaining a message and sending it to its target are directly linked in terms of control flow, with the output of one (the `Message` object) being used as input for the next operation (`sendToTarget`). Given there's no other instruction set that could be considered a sink based on our criteria and the code provided, this stands alone.
