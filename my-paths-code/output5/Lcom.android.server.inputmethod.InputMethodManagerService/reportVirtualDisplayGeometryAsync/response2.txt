To determine the access control level for the `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths, all of which involve checking for null pointers and handling exceptions. The critical part that interacts with external components is the call to `getDisplayInfo(p2)` on `mDisplayManagerInternal`. This suggests interaction with display settings or information, which could be sensitive in terms of system configuration but doesn't directly imply a security risk like accessing user data.

2. **Sink Code**: The identified sink code involves retrieving `DisplayInfo` using `this.mDisplayManagerInternal.getDisplayInfo(p2);`. This operation is about fetching information related to displays and does not inherently suggest a dangerous or privacy-violating action by itself.

3. **Similar APIs**: The provided similar API, `releaseVirtualDisplay`, has an access control level of `NONE`. This method seems to be involved in managing virtual displays, which aligns with the functionality of reporting geometry. Both methods appear to deal with display management aspects rather than sensitive user data or dangerous operations that could compromise system security.

Given these observations:

- The method does not seem to handle sensitive user data directly.
- It interacts with system components related to display information.
- The similar API `releaseVirtualDisplay` has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to virtual display management might not be considered dangerous or requiring special permissions in this context.

Based on the provided ground truth and the nature of the method, it seems reasonable to assign a moderate access control level. However, without explicit handling of sensitive data or indications of dangerous operations (like those affecting system security directly), the most fitting choice from the given options appears to be `NORMAL`, as it reflects an operation that is neither completely unrestricted (`NONE`) nor poses significant risks (`DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`).

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision leans on the understanding that while `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` deals with system-related information (display geometry), it doesn't explicitly engage with user-sensitive data, dangerous operations, or require elevated system privileges based on the provided context.
