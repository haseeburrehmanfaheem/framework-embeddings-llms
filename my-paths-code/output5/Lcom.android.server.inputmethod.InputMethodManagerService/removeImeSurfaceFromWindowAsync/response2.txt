To determine the access control level for the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method sends a message to a handler with an identifier (`1061`) and an `IBinder` object (`p1`). This action does not directly interact with sensitive user data or perform operations that could compromise system security or user privacy.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves obtaining a message from a handler and sending it to its target. This operation is related to inter-process communication (IPC) or internal messaging within the application, which by itself does not imply a direct risk to user data or system integrity unless the message content is sensitive or leads to an action that impacts security.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout(I)V**: This API has a high similarity score and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It involves scheduling a timeout related to biometric authentication, which does not directly imply a risk to system security or user privacy.
   - **reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock(ZI)V**: Also with a high similarity score and assigned an access control level of `NONE`, this API reports the success of a biometric unlock attempt. The action itself is informative and does not pose a direct threat to system security or user data.

Given these observations:
- The method's operation (sending a message) is similar in nature to the compared APIs, which are both classified as `NONE` in terms of access control.
- There's no indication that `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` directly accesses sensitive information or performs an action that could compromise system security.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its operation, the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method should be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
