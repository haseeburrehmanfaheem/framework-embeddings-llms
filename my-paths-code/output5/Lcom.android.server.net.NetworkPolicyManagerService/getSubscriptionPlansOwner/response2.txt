To determine the access control level for the `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet**: The method retrieves a value from `mSubscriptionPlansOwner` based on an integer parameter `p1` and returns it as a string.

2. **Sink Code**: It involves getting a value from `mSubscriptionPlansOwner` and returning it, which suggests interaction with potentially sensitive data related to subscription plans.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **setSubscriptionPlans**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission due to its ability to modify subscription plans.
   - **setSubscriptionOverride**: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although the code snippet provided does not directly show setting values into `mSubscriptionPlansOwner`, it interacts with related data structures (`mSubscriptionPlans`), suggesting that modifications or accesses to these areas are restricted.

Given this context, we can infer the following:
- The method `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` is involved in retrieving sensitive information about subscription plans.
- Similar methods that modify or interact closely with subscription plan data have a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`).
- However, `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` only retrieves information without modifying it.

Considering these points, while the `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method does handle potentially sensitive data (subscription plans owner), its read-only nature might suggest a lower risk compared to methods that can modify such data. Nonetheless, because it deals with specific user or system data that could be considered private or sensitive, assigning an access control level of `NORMAL` seems appropriate. This is because `NONE` would imply no restrictions at all, which does not fit with handling potentially sensitive information, and `DANGEROUS` typically applies to operations that can cause direct harm (e.g., financial transactions, sending SMS). `SYS_OR_SIG` might be too restrictive for a read operation unless the data returned is extremely sensitive or protected by system-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the nature of similar APIs:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This conclusion balances the need to protect potentially sensitive information with the method's read-only functionality.
