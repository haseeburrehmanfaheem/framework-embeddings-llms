Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `addUidPolicy` method.

The `addUidPolicy` method interacts with the following sinks:

* `this.mUidPolicy.get(p1, 0)`
* `this.mUidPolicy.delete(p1)`
* `this.mHandler.obtainMessage(13, p1, (p2 | v3), v12)`
* `v13.sendToTarget()`
* `this.mUidPolicy.put(p1, p3)`

The similar APIs provided are:

* `getUidPolicy(I)I` with access control level `SYS_OR_SIG`
* `setUidPolicy(II)V` with access control level `SYS_OR_SIG`

Both of these similar APIs have a high similarity score and interact with the same sinks as the `addUidPolicy` method. The `getUidPolicy` method only reads from the `mUidPolicy` map, while the `setUidPolicy` method writes to the `mUidPolicy` map and sends a message to the handler.

The `addUidPolicy` method also writes to the `mUidPolicy` map (in path 2) and sends a message to the handler. Therefore, based on the similarity with these APIs and the interactions with the same sinks, we can conclude that the access control level of the `addUidPolicy` method is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
