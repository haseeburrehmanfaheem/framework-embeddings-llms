For the given API `getRestrictBackground()`, let's analyze its code to identify potential sinks according to the provided rules.

The method directly returns a field named `mRestrictBackground`. This operation involves accessing a field, which is one of the cases we need to consider for potential sinks. 

Given that:
- The accessed field (`mRestrictBackground`) has naming similarity with the API name (`getRestrictBackground`), 
- And it's returned by the API,

This matches at least one of the positive rules regarding field get cases.

Therefore, the instruction contributing to a sink in this case is:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "return this.mRestrictBackground;"
    ]
]
}
```

Note that there are no other operations (like method invocations, object creations) within this API that contribute to additional sinks. The direct field access and return constitute the entirety of the sink in this simple case.
