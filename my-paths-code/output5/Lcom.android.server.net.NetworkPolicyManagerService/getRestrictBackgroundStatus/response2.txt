To determine the access control level for the `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` simply returns a constant integer value (`3`) regardless of the input parameter `p1`. This implies that the method does not perform any operations that could potentially pose a risk or require special permissions to execute.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isUidPresentOnDisplay(II)Z**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it doesn't require any specific permission or access control to be executed. Its similarity score with `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` is relatively high (`0.7805536985397339`), suggesting some operational similarities, possibly in terms of simplicity and lack of critical operations.
   - **getHibernationStatsForUser(Ljava/util/List;I)Ljava/util/Map;**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, implying it requires system or signature-level permissions to be accessed. The similarity score with `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` is somewhat lower (`0.713753879070282`) compared to the first similar API, but still significant.

3. **Access Control Decision**: Given that `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` returns a constant value without any apparent dependency on sensitive data or operations that would require elevated permissions, it aligns more closely with the behavior and access control level of `isUidPresentOnDisplay(II)Z`. Both methods seem to lack critical operations that would necessitate higher access controls.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` appears to be `NONE`, as it does not engage in activities requiring special permissions or posing risks similar to those that would warrant `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` access controls based on the provided similarities and code behavior.
