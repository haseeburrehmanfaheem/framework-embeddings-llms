To determine the access control level for the `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method checks if a UID is restricted on metered networks by retrieving its blocked state from `mUidBlockedState`.
   - The condition `if (( & -65536) == 0)` seems to be a bitwise operation, but without more context, it's unclear what this condition specifically checks. However, the presence of such operations typically doesn't directly influence access control decisions.
   - The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the UID is restricted.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code `Object v2 = this.mUidBlockedState.get(p1);` shows that the method interacts with `mUidBlockedState`, which stores blocked states for UIDs. This interaction suggests that the method accesses sensitive information related to network restrictions on a per-UID basis.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API, `isUidNetworkingBlocked(IZ)Z`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with blocked states and logs networking blockage reasons, which implies it deals with sensitive network management information.
   - The similarity score between the two methods is 0.7377870082855225, indicating a significant resemblance in their functionalities or code structures.

Given these points:

- **Access Control Decision**:
  - Since `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` deals with network restrictions on a per-UID basis and interacts with sensitive state information (`mUidBlockedState`), it's reasonable to infer that this method accesses or modifies sensitive data.
  - The similarity with `isUidNetworkingBlocked`, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggests that `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` might also require a similar level of access control due to its interaction with network policy states.

Considering the sensitivity of network management and user data, assigning an access control level that reflects the need for system or signature-level permissions is prudent. Thus, based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege and acknowledges the method's potential to interact with sensitive network management data, similar to its counterpart `isUidNetworkingBlocked`.
