To determine the access control level for the `getStartedJobs` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getStartedJobs` method retrieves a list of started jobs from `this.mRunningJobs`, which is an `ArraySet`. It then creates an `ArrayList` based on the size of `mRunningJobs` and returns this list.
   - The sink code snippet shows interaction with `mRunningJobs` to get its size and create an `ArrayList` based on that size.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **getAllPendingJobs()**:
     - Similarity Score: 0.7921075820922852
     - Access Control Level: NONE
     - This method interacts with `mJobSet` to get jobs by UID, suggesting it deals with job scheduling based on user IDs.
     - The access control level is NONE, indicating that this operation does not require special permissions or access rights.
   - **getAllJobSnapshots()**:
     - Similarity Score: 0.7261872291564941
     - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
     - This method involves creating a list of job snapshots and iterating over all jobs using `JobSchedulerService.mJobs.forEachJob`. It returns a `ParceledListSlice` of these snapshots.
     - The access control level is SYS_OR_SIG, suggesting that this operation requires system or signature-level permissions, possibly due to its interaction with sensitive system services or data.

3. **Comparison and Decision**:
   - Both similar APIs deal with job scheduling and retrieval but differ in their access control levels.
   - `getStartedJobs` method seems to be more aligned with `getAllPendingJobs()` in terms of simplicity and lack of direct interaction with sensitive system data or requiring elevated permissions. It merely retrieves a list of started jobs without modifying system state or accessing sensitive information that would require higher permission levels.
   - Given the similarity scores and the nature of operations, it's reasonable to infer that `getStartedJobs` does not require special system-level permissions or signature-level access.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and comparison with similar APIs, the `getStartedJobs` method appears to be a straightforward retrieval operation without the need for elevated permissions. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of **NONE** to this API, as it does not involve sensitive operations or data that would necessitate stricter access controls.
