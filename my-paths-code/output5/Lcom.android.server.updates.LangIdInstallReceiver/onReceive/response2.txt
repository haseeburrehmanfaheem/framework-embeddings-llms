To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and starts it. This action does not directly interact with sensitive user data or perform actions that require special permissions (like accessing location, contacts, etc.).

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code is essentially the same as the code snippet provided for the `onReceive` method. It creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and calls its `start` method. This doesn't seem to involve any operations that would require elevated permissions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs have a similarity score of 1.0, indicating they are nearly identical in terms of parameters and possibly functionality.
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that the operations performed by these methods do not require any special permissions or pose significant risks.

Given this analysis, since the method's actions (starting a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`) and those of its similar APIs do not seem to involve sensitive data or dangerous operations, the access control level for the `onReceive` method should be consistent with that of its similar APIs.

**Final Access Control Level**:

{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
