To determine the access control level for the `requestUninstall` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `requestUninstall` method enforces a permission check at the beginning using `this.mPermissionHelper.enforceCallerHasPermission("android.permission.UPDATE_TIME_ZONE_RULES");`. This indicates that the method is protected by a specific permission, which suggests a certain level of access control.

However, when looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `requestInstall` has an access control level of `NONE`, despite having very similar code to the sink code snippet in `requestUninstall`.
2. `requestNothing` also has an access control level of `NONE`, with similar code patterns involving `ByteArrayInputStream`, `DataInputStream`, and operations on tokens and package versions.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it might initially suggest that `requestUninstall` could also be `NONE`. However, the key difference lies in the explicit permission check at the beginning of the `requestUninstall` method, which is not mentioned in the provided code snippets for the similar APIs.

Considering the presence of a permission check (`android.permission.UPDATE_TIME_ZONE_RULES`) in `requestUninstall`, this method seems to require more access control than what `NONE` would imply. Among the given options (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), `NORMAL` appears to be the most fitting because it suggests a level of protection (through the permission check) that is not as severe as `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` but more controlled than `NONE`.

Therefore, based on the analysis and considering the explicit permission enforcement in the method, the access control level for `requestUninstall` would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
