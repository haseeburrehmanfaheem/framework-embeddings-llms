To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we should consider the similarity in code and functionality with other provided APIs that have known access control levels. 

Given that:
- The provided `onReceive` method has a similarity score of 1.0 with two other APIs.
- Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The code snippets for these similar APIs are essentially identical to the code snippet in the `onReceive` method we're evaluating, involving the creation and starting of a `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` instance.

The high similarity score (1.0) indicates that the functionality and possibly the context in which these methods are used are very similar or even identical. The fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` suggests that the operations performed by these methods do not pose significant security risks or require special permissions to execute.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity with other APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
