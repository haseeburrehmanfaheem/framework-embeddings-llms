To identify potential sinks in the provided code snippet, let's analyze it step by step according to the given rules.

The API is `onReceive`, and it has two parameters: `Context p1` and `Intent p2`. 

1. **Method Invocation**: The method invocation of interest here is `v1.start();`. However, to determine if this constitutes a sink, we need to examine how `v1` is created and what its relationship is with the API's parameters.

2. **Object Creation**: An object `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1` is created. This object takes `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` as arguments in its constructor. Since `p0` isn't a parameter of `onReceive`, it likely refers to the context or another field of the class. The creation of this object directly involves data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and possibly indirectly through `p1`).

3. **Field Access/Updates**: There's no direct field access or update in the given snippet that follows the positive rules for being a sink.

Considering the positive rules:
- The method invocation `v1.start()` doesn't directly follow any of the rules since we don't have its implementation details, but it does involve an object created with API parameters.
- The creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1` follows the rule because it involves data flow from the API parameters.

Given these observations, there is one potential sink set that can be identified:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
        "v1.start();"
    ]
]
}
```

This sink involves the creation of an object with data flow from API parameters and the invocation of a method on that object. Without more context about what `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` does or how `p0` relates to the API's purpose, it's challenging to rank its sensitivity accurately. However, given the direct involvement of API parameters in creating this object and subsequently calling a method on it, it is considered a potential sink based on the provided rules.
