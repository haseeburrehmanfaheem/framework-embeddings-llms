Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public PermissionGroupInfo getPermissionGroupInfo(String p1, int p2){
    return v1;
}
```

Since there is no explicit data flow from the input parameters `p1` and `p2` to the returned value `v1`, we cannot directly apply the positive rules. However, considering that for small APIs or when the rules do not directly apply, we may consider all instructions as part of a sink if they contribute to the API's functionality.

Given this context:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "public PermissionGroupInfo getPermissionGroupInfo(String p1, int p2){",
            "return v1;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This represents the entire code path as a single sink due to its simplicity and the lack of direct data flow that matches the positive rules. The returned value `v1` is considered sensitive since it's directly related to the API's purpose, even though we don't see its initialization or how it's influenced by `p1` and `p2`.
