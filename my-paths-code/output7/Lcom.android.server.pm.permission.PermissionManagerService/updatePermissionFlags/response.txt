Since the provided method `updatePermissionFlags` does not contain any instructions that contribute to a sink, according to the positive rules, there are no sinks in this API.

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

This is because the method simply returns without executing any operations or accessing/modifying any fields, and therefore does not follow any of the positive rules.
