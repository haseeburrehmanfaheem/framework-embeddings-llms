To determine the access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet for `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` involves iterating over installed packages using `forEachInstalledPackage` and filtering them based on a certain condition (in this case, auto-revoke exemption requested packages). It returns a list of packages that match the specified criteria.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided shows two paths:
   - The first path involves creating an `ArrayList`, initializing a lambda function (`PermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`), and then using `forEachInstalledPackage` to populate the list based on the lambda condition.
   - The second path directly retrieves packages with an auto-revoke policy from `p0.getPackagesWithAutoRevokePolicy(1, p1)`.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided: `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages(I)Ljava/util/List;`. Both have a high similarity score (0.9997791051864624 and 0.9977872371673584) with the method in question.
   - These similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permission to access.

Given these points, we can infer that:
- The functionality of `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` is closely related to package management and auto-revoke policies, which are sensitive operations.
- The similar APIs, which also deal with auto-revoke exemption (granted packages in their case), require a high level of access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`).
- The code snippet for `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` interacts with system-level components (like `mPackageManagerInt`) and performs operations that could potentially reveal sensitive information about installed packages or affect system security.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that accessing the list of auto-revoke exemption requested packages should also require a significant level of permission to protect user privacy and system integrity. Therefore, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` aligns with the access control levels of its similar APIs and reflects the sensitive nature of the operation it performs.
