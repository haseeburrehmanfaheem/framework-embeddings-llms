To assign an access control level to the `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs that have known access control levels.

Given that the similar APIs (`getSplitPermissions()` and `getPermissionInfo()`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that methods related to permission management or retrieval are considered sensitive and require a higher level of access control. The similarity in code structure (returning a value directly) and the context of permission management also imply that `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` should be treated with a similar level of sensitivity.

The method's purpose is to retrieve allowlisted restricted permissions, which involves accessing potentially sensitive information regarding the app's or system's security configurations. This kind of operation typically requires careful access control to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of such critical data.

Therefore, considering the similarities in functionality and code structure with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` should also be assigned a similar level of access control.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
