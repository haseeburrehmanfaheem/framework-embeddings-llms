To determine the access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - The method has two similar APIs with high similarity scores (0.9997791051864624 and 0.9977872371673584), both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to auto-revoke exemption policies are considered sensitive and thus require a higher level of access control.

2. **Code Semantics**:
   - The code snippet for `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` involves iterating over installed packages using `forEachInstalledPackage` with a specific lambda function, and it returns a list of packages that have been granted auto-revoke exemptions.
   - The sink code further reinforces the idea that this method interacts with package management at a level that requires careful access control, as it deals with policies affecting how packages are managed.

3. **Comparison with Provided APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages`) have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating they are system- or signature-protected due to their sensitive nature.
   - The minor differences in the lambda function parameters (e.g., `1` vs. `2`) do not seem to alter the fundamental sensitivity of the operation, which is determining packages under specific auto-revoke policies.

Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method should have a similar access control level as its highly similar counterparts, due to its involvement in managing and querying package permissions at a system level.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This choice reflects the sensitive nature of the operation, aligning with how similar methods are protected within the system.
