To determine the access control level for the `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` method has high similarity scores with two other methods: `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` and `addPermission`. Both of these similar methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Semantics of Similar APIs**: 
   - `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` is used to remove a permission from the allowlist for restricted permissions, which implies it deals with system-level or signature-level permissions.
   - `addPermission` adds a new permission, potentially to a package or at a system level, indicating it also involves sensitive operations that require either system or signature-level access.

3. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The provided code snippet for `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` doesn't give explicit details about its implementation but considering its similarity with other methods that deal with permissions and have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it suggests that this method also operates on sensitive permission settings.

4. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose any security risks.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that require standard permissions but are not dangerous or system-level.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can cause harm if misused, such as accessing user data without consent.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-level operations or those requiring signature-level permissions, which includes managing permissions.

Given the high similarity with methods classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the operation of adding a permission to an allowlist (which involves managing system-level settings), it's reasonable to conclude that the `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` method should also be classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`.
