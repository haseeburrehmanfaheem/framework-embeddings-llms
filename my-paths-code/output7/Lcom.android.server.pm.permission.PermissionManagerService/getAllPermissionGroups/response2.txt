To determine the access control level for the `getAllPermissionGroups` method, we should consider the similarities with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `queryPermissionsByGroup` and `getGrantedUriPermissions`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The `getAllPermissionGroups` method returns a `ParceledListSlice` object, which contains permission groups. This operation seems to be related to managing or querying permissions, which is a sensitive task that typically requires careful access control.

Given the high similarity scores with `queryPermissionsByGroup` (0.9941756725311279) and `getGrantedUriPermissions` (0.8921518921852112), and considering that both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that accessing or manipulating permission groups should also be restricted to system or signature-level access.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity with other APIs that deal with sensitive permission data, the most appropriate access control level for the `getAllPermissionGroups` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
