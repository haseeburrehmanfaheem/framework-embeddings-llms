To determine the access control level for the `grantRuntimePermission` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` and `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The similarity scores between `grantRuntimePermission` and these two APIs are 0.7828670740127563 and 0.7690694332122803, respectively. These high similarity scores suggest that the functionality and potential risk of `grantRuntimePermission` are closely related to those of `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` and `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission`.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically indicates that the API can only be invoked by system or signature applications due to its sensitive nature (e.g., managing permissions), it's reasonable to infer that `grantRuntimePermission` might also require a similar level of restriction. This is because granting runtime permissions could potentially introduce security risks if not properly controlled, such as allowing malicious apps to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or features.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the potential security implications, the access control level for `grantRuntimePermission` should be aligned with that of its similar APIs.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
