Since the provided code does not contain any method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that follow at least one of the positive rules, and given the constraints of the problem, we consider all instructions as part of a sink for small APIs. However, in this case, there's only one instruction which is `return;`, but since it doesn't follow any of the positive rules directly and doesn't involve data flow or sensitive operations, the API does not contain significant sinks based on the provided positive and negative rules.

But to adhere strictly to your request for a JSON format output even in cases where no significant sinks are identified under normal conditions:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public void grantRuntimePermission(String p1, String p2, int p3){",
        "return;",
        "}"
    ]
]
}
```

This API is very simple and doesn't seem to perform any meaningful operations related to granting runtime permissions as the method name suggests. It simply returns without doing anything with the parameters `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. Thus, in a real-world analysis, this would likely be flagged for further review due to its lack of functionality despite its name implying significant permission management capabilities.
