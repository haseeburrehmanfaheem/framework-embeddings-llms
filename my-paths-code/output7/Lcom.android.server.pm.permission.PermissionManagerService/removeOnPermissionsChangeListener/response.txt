Based on the provided code:

```java
public void removeOnPermissionsChangeListener(IOnPermissionsChangeListener p1){
    return;
}
```

Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that contribute to a sink according to the positive rules, and considering this is a small API with limited instructions, we can analyze it as follows:

The `return` statement does not follow any of the positive rules for identifying sinks. However, since there's only one instruction in this method and no other operations are performed, the entire method could be considered under relaxed rules for small APIs.

But, strictly following the guidelines provided:

```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```

There are no identified sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. The `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` method does not perform any operations that would qualify it as a sink based on the given criteria.
