To determine the access control level for the `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**:
   - The method has a high similarity score (0.9400827884674072) with `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that both methods might require similar levels of access control due to their similar functionality and parameters.
   - It also shows a significant similarity (0.8352510333061218) with `removePermission`, which is also classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that operations related to permission management are treated with a higher level of security or restriction.

2. **Functionality**:
   - The name `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` implies it deals with permissions, specifically removing permissions from an allowlist for restricted permissions. This kind of operation typically requires careful control and is usually not exposed to regular applications due to its potential impact on system security and functionality.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Implies no specific access control restrictions.
   - `NORMAL`: Typical level for most APIs that don't deal with sensitive information or critical system changes.
   - `DANGEROUS`: For operations that can affect the user's privacy or the device's security but are still accessible by third-party apps with proper permissions.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for operations that require system-level privileges or signature-level access, indicating they are either restricted to system apps or require a specific signature to use.

Given these considerations:

- The high similarity scores and the nature of the operation (`removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission`) suggest it involves critical permission management.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, implying that such operations are sensitive and should be restricted.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's functionality, its similarity to other system-sensitive permission management methods, and their respective access control levels, the most appropriate access control level for `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` would also be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized or system-level components can perform such sensitive operations.
