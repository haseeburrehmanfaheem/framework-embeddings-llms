To determine the access control level for the `updatePermissionFlagsForAllApps` method, we must analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs, considering their access control levels and code semantics.

1. **Understanding `updatePermissionFlagsForAllApps`:**
   - This method takes three integer parameters (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) and returns without any explicit actions or interactions with other components that could indicate a need for specific permissions or access controls.
   - The lack of interaction with sensitive data or external components suggests it might not require stringent access control.

2. **Analyzing Similar APIs:**
   - **`showInputMethodPickerFromClient`:** This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions, likely due to its involvement in displaying input method pickers, which could interact with sensitive user data or system settings.
   - **`isCallerActiveScorer`:** With an access control level of `NONE`, this API suggests that checking if the caller is an active scorer does not require specific permissions, possibly because it's more about internal state or less sensitive information.

3. **Comparison and Decision:**
   - Given that `updatePermissionFlagsForAllApps` seems to be a placeholder or an empty method without actual functionality (as indicated by its simple return statement), it doesn't directly interact with sensitive data or require specific permissions based on the provided code snippet.
   - However, its name implies potential involvement in permission management, which could suggest a need for careful access control. Yet, without explicit actions or interactions that would typically necessitate higher access controls (like those seen in `showInputMethodPickerFromClient`), and considering the method does not perform any operations, we can infer its required access level based on similarity scores and the nature of the methods it's compared against.

Given these considerations and the fact that the method is currently non-operational (as it simply returns without performing any actions), the most fitting access control level, by analogy with `isCallerActiveScorer` which also doesn't seem to interact with sensitive data directly in its provided snippet, would be `NONE`. This choice reflects the method's current lack of functionality and potential future need for reevaluation if its implementation changes.
