Since the provided method `updatePermissionFlagsForAllApps` does not contain any instructions that contribute to a sink according to the positive rules (method invocation, field access or updates, object creation, and data flows), we cannot identify any potential sinks.

However, considering the relaxed rule for small APIs where all instructions can be considered part of a sink if no other sinks are found, in this case, there's only one instruction which is `return;`. This does not process any input parameters or create new objects but given the lack of any operations and its simplicity, it still doesn't clearly fit into being a significant data flow or operation that we typically consider as part of a sink.

Given the API simply returns without performing any substantial operations, there are no meaningful instructions to report as sinks. Thus, according to the provided format for reporting sinks:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    []
]
}
```
