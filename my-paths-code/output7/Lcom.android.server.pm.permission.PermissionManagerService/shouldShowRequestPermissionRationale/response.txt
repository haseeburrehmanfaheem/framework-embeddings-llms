Here's the analysis of the provided code:

The given code snippet does not contain any method invocations (native or inner methods) that follow the positive rules. It also doesn't have field get/set cases or creation of new objects that match the rules.

However, since this is a small API and no sinks are found under the standard rules, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink. 

Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public boolean shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(String p1, String p2, int p3){",
        "return v1;"
    ]
]
}
```

Note that this API seems to be incomplete as `v1` is not defined anywhere in the given code snippet. In a real-world scenario, `v1` would likely depend on the input parameters or other operations within the class. If more context were provided about how `v1` is determined, further analysis could identify potential sinks based on its dependency chain.
