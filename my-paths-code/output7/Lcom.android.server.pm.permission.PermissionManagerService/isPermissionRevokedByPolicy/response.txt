Based on the provided code snippet, it does not contain any explicit method invocations, field access or updates, object creation, or data flows that directly contribute to a sink. However, considering the API name and its return value, we can identify potential sinks.


Since there are no complex operations in this API and following the relaxed rules for small APIs, we consider all instructions as part of a sink:


{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public boolean isPermissionRevokedByPolicy(String p1, String p2, int p3){",
        "return v1;"
    ]
]
}
Note: The variable `v1` seems to be undefined in the provided code snippet. It should either be defined within the method or be a class field for this code to compile successfully. For the purpose of this analysis, it's assumed that `v1` is defined elsewhere and holds some value related to permission revocation status.
