To determine the access control level for the `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` method shows high similarity scores with two other methods: `getPermissionFlags` and `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission`. Both of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - `getPermissionFlags` retrieves flags associated with a particular permission, which can be sensitive information but is generally used in the context of managing or querying permissions rather than performing actions that directly impact system security or user data.
   - `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` removes a permission from an allowlist for restricted permissions, which implies a level of system or signature-level access because modifying permission states, especially for restricted permissions, requires elevated privileges to prevent unauthorized changes.

3. **Code Structure**: The code structure of `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` is straightforward and similar to the other two methods in terms of parameter types (strings and integers) and return type (boolean), suggesting it operates within a similar domain of permission management.

4. **Access Control Implications**:
   - Given that both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, this suggests they are either system-level APIs or require signature-level permissions to execute, which is typical for operations that can affect the security posture of the device or manage sensitive user data.
   - The `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` method likely operates within a similar context, as it checks whether a permission has been revoked by policy. This operation could be crucial in determining the current state of permissions on the device and thus might require system or signature-level access to ensure that only authorized components can query this information.

Based on these considerations, the `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` method is likely to require an access control level similar to its counterparts due to the nature of its operation and the potential implications for system security and permission management.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination aligns with the access control levels assigned to similar methods that interact with sensitive permission information, reflecting the need for elevated privileges to securely manage or query such data.
