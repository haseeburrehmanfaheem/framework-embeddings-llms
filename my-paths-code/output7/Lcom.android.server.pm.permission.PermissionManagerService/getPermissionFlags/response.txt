Since the provided code does not contain any method invocations, field access or updates, object creation, or data flows that follow the positive rules, and considering it's a very simple API with minimal operations, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink for small APIs.

Here is the JSON representation of the identified sinks:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public int getPermissionFlags(String p1, String p2, int p3){",
        "return v1;"
    ]
]
}
```
