To determine the access control level for the `getPermissionFlags` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet**: The method takes three parameters (`String p1`, `String p2`, and `int p3`) and returns an integer value (`v1`). This suggests it is querying or retrieving some form of permission-related data.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getPermissionGroupInfo**: This API has a high similarity score (0.8457692265510559) with `getPermissionFlags`. It is used to retrieve information about a permission group and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This level indicates that the API can only be called by system or signature applications, suggesting it deals with sensitive information.
   - **isPermissionRevokedByPolicy**: With a similarity score of 0.8077871799468994, this method checks if a permission is revoked by policy. It also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, implying that it handles sensitive or protected data.

Given the similarities in purpose and the access control levels of these related APIs, we can infer that `getPermissionFlags` likely deals with sensitive permission-related data as well. The high similarity scores suggest that `getPermissionFlags` operates within a similar context or domain as `getPermissionGroupInfo` and `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy`, which are both restricted to system or signature applications due to their handling of sensitive information.

Therefore, considering the method's purpose and its similarities with other APIs that have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is reasonable to conclude that `getPermissionFlags` should also be assigned the same level of access control to maintain consistency and protect sensitive permission data.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
