To determine the access control level for the `isAutoRevokeExempted` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `isAutoRevokeExempted` method has two paths:

1.  The first path checks if the caller has the necessary permissions to access the package information. It calls `filterAppAccess` to check if the app has access to the package, and then checks if the caller is the installer of record for the package using `isCallerInstallerOfRecord`. If these conditions are met, it proceeds to check the AppOps manager for the `OP_AUTO_REVOKE_PERMISSIONS` operation.
2.  The second path also checks the `filterAppAccess` and `isCallerInstallerOfRecord`, but it returns immediately without performing any further checks.

The sink code provided includes calls to `getPackage`, `Binder.getCallingUid`, `filterAppAccess`, `isCallerInstallerOfRecord`, and `getUid`.

Now, let's compare this with the similar APIs:

*   The `setAutoRevokeExempted` API has a similarity score of 0.8867 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also interacts with package information and checks the caller's permissions using `isCallerInstallerOfRecord` and AppOps manager operations.
*   The `getVersionCodeForPackage` API has a similarity score of 0.8247 and an access control level of `NONE`. This method retrieves version code information for a package without performing any permission checks.

Considering these comparisons, the `isAutoRevokeExempted` method appears to be more similar to `setAutoRevokeExempted` in terms of its functionality and permission checks. Both methods interact with sensitive package information and perform checks using the AppOps manager.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `isAutoRevokeExempted` method should be similar to that of `setAutoRevokeExempted`, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive package information and perform AppOps manager operations.
