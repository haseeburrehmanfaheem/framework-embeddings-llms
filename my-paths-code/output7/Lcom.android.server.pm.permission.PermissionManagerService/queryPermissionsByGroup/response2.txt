To determine the access control level for the `queryPermissionsByGroup` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method returns a `ParceledListSlice`, which is a type of object that can contain a list of items. This suggests it's involved in retrieving or manipulating data related to permissions.
   - The decision to return an empty result (`return 0;`) or a populated `ParceledListSlice` depends on the value of `v1`. This conditional behavior indicates some form of internal state or parameter validation affects the output.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves creating a new `ParceledListSlice` with `v1` and returning it. This operation is similar to what's seen in the provided APIs (`getAllPermissionGroups` and `getGrantedUriPermissions`), where a `ParceledListSlice` is created and returned.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both `getAllPermissionGroups` and `getGrantedUriPermissions` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to permission groups or uri permissions are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level access.
   - The high similarity scores (0.9941756725311279 for `getAllPermissionGroups` and 0.8929283618927002 for `getGrantedUriPermissions`) indicate that `queryPermissionsByGroup` likely performs a similar function or operates within the same domain of permission management.

Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the `queryPermissionsByGroup` method is involved in managing or querying sensitive information related to permissions. Since both highly similar APIs are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the nature of the operation (returning a list of permissions by group), it suggests that this method should also be restricted to system or signature-level access to prevent unauthorized exposure or manipulation of permission data.

**Access Control Level Decision**:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision aligns with the access control levels assigned to similar APIs and reflects the sensitive nature of permission management operations.
