To determine the access control level for the `getPermissionInfo` method, we'll analyze its similarity to other APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `getSplitPermissions()` with an Access Control Level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions(Ljava/lang/String;II)` also with an Access Control Level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these methods have a high similarity score (1.0) with the `getPermissionInfo` method, indicating their code structures or functionalities are closely related.

Given that both similar APIs have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that operations related to permission information typically require system-level permissions or signature-level access due to the sensitive nature of permission data. This is a common practice in Android development to protect user privacy and prevent unauthorized access to app permissions.

The `getPermissionInfo` method, by returning `PermissionInfo`, also deals with sensitive permission data. Thus, following the pattern set by its highly similar counterparts, it's reasonable to conclude that `getPermissionInfo` should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to maintain consistency in protecting system resources and user privacy.

Therefore, based on the similarities and the nature of the method's functionality:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
