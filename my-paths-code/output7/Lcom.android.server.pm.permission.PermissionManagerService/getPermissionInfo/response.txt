Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules, and considering the provided code does not contain any operations other than a return statement, we can analyze it directly. 

In this case, there is only one relevant instruction which contributes to the sink: 
"return v1;". However, since "v1" is not defined in the given snippet and no direct data flow from parameters p1, p2, or p3 to the return statement is shown, we cannot directly link it to a specific set of instructions that follow the positive rules based on the information provided.

Given the constraints and focusing on the requirement for a coherent set of instructions with a clear dataflow link between them, the JSON representation would ideally highlight any potential sink related to the API's parameters or return value. Since "v1" is not defined within this snippet and does not directly relate to p1, p2, or p3 through the provided code, we cannot accurately identify a data flow that involves these parameters.

However, for the sake of providing an answer based on the instructions given:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "return v1;"
    ]
]
}
```

This response acknowledges the limitation in identifying a comprehensive set of sink-related instructions due to the incomplete information provided about how `v1` is defined or related to the parameters `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. In a real-world scenario, further code analysis would be necessary to accurately determine data flows and potential sinks.
