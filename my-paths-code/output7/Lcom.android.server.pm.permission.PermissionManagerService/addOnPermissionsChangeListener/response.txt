Since the provided method `addOnPermissionsChangeListener` does not contain any instructions that process or modify sensitive data, nor does it invoke other methods that may contribute to a sink, and considering it returns immediately without any further operations, there are no sinks identified in this API according to the given positive rules.

However, following the guidelines for small APIs where all instructions might be considered part of a sink if no clear sinks are found under the relaxed rules, we can still attempt to analyze the method's structure:

The method takes an `IOnPermissionsChangeListener` as a parameter but does not perform any operations with it before returning. Given this context and adhering strictly to the guidelines provided for JSON output format, even though there isn't a clear sink in terms of data processing or sensitive information handling, we could argue that the entire method body is relevant due to its simplicity and lack of other operations.

Thus, considering all instructions as part of a potential sink for the sake of completeness in this specific case:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public void addOnPermissionsChangeListener(IOnPermissionsChangeListener p1){",
        "return;"
    ]
]
}
```

This approach is somewhat forced by the requirement to provide a JSON output even when the method does not contain typical sink characteristics, emphasizing the importance of context in such analyses. Normally, methods that do not process or handle sensitive data and do not contribute to potential security vulnerabilities would not be highlighted as sinks.
