To assign an access control level to the `getSplitPermissions` method, we need to consider its similarity to other APIs that interact with similar sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The `getSplitPermissions` method returns a list of split permissions directly without any additional checks or modifications. This behavior is similar to the provided ground truth APIs:

1. `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions(Ljava/lang/String;II)Ljava/util/List;` - This API also returns a list (of allowlisted restricted permissions) and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `getPermissionInfo(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)Landroid/content/pm/PermissionInfo;` - Although it returns a `PermissionInfo` object instead of a list, the core idea is that it provides information about permissions, which can be sensitive. It also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these similarities and considering the semantic context:

- **SYS_OR_SIG** access control level typically applies to APIs that are either system-level (requiring system or signature-level permission) or handle sensitive information that could potentially impact the security or integrity of the system if mishandled.
- The fact that `getSplitPermissions` deals with permissions, which are a critical aspect of Android's security model, suggests it should be treated with care similar to how `SYS_OR_SIG` level APIs are handled.

Therefore, considering the direct return of permission-related data without explicit checks or transformations, and aligning with the access control levels of the provided similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `getSplitPermissions` method would be **SYS_OR_SIG**.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
