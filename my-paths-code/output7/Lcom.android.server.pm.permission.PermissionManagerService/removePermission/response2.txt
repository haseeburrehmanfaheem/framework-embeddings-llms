To determine the access control level for the `removePermission` method, we should consider its similarity to other APIs that interact with permissions, such as `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` and `addPermission`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to modifying permissions (either adding or removing) are considered sensitive and thus require a higher level of access control.

Given the `removePermission` method's purpose is to remove a permission, it implies a modification to the system's security settings. Although its implementation seems trivial (`return;`), the method's declaration and naming convention imply an intention to affect the system's permission state, which is a critical aspect of Android's security model.

Considering the similarities in functionality with `removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` and `addPermission`, both of which are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it's reasonable to infer that `removePermission` should also be treated as requiring a significant level of authorization. This is because altering permissions can have profound implications for system security and user data protection.

Therefore, despite the simplistic implementation provided, based on the method's name, its interaction with sensitive system settings (permissions), and the precedent set by similar APIs (`removeAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` and `addPermission`), it's logical to conclude that `removePermission` should also have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
