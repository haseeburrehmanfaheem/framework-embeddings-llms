To assign an access control level to the `setAutoRevokeExempted` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `setAutoRevokeExempted` method has two paths:

1. In the first path, it checks if the caller is the installer of record for the given package (`v6 = this.mPackageManagerInt.isCallerInstallerOfRecord(v2, v3)`). If true, it proceeds to check the AppOps mode (`this.mAppOpsManager.checkOpNoThrow(98, v9, v10)`). If the mode is allowed (0), it sets the AppOps mode for the given package and UID (`this.mAppOpsManager.setMode(97, v9, v13)`).
2. In the second path, it returns false if the AppOps mode check fails.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `isAutoRevokeExempted(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also checks the caller's installer of record status and filters app access based on the UID.
2. `queryStatsForUid(Ljava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/String;)Landroid/app/usage/StorageStats;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method retrieves application information and storage stats, but it does not perform any explicit permission or AppOps checks.

Comparing the code snippets, we can see that `setAutoRevokeExempted` performs AppOps mode checks and sets the mode for a given package and UID. This operation requires elevated privileges, as it affects the app's behavior and potentially impacts system security.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the `setAutoRevokeExempted` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, similar to the provided similar APIs. This is because the method:

* Performs AppOps mode checks, which are typically restricted to system or signature-level processes.
* Sets the AppOps mode for a given package and UID, which requires elevated privileges.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `setAutoRevokeExempted` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
