To assign an access control level to the `notifyResourceGranted` API, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs.

The `notifyResourceGranted` API has three paths:

1. The first path simply calls `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v11)` without performing any notable actions.
2. The second path checks if there are enabled profiles for the current user and, if not, also calls `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v11)`.
3. The third path is more complex: it sends a broadcast intent with the action "android.intent.action.MEDIA_RESOURCE_GRANTED" after checking for enabled profiles.

The sink code snippet shows that the API is sending a broadcast intent with a specific permission ("android.permission.RECEIVE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_USAGE").

Comparing this behavior to the similar APIs:

- `setApplicationRestrictions` has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It sends a broadcast intent with a system-level action ("android.intent.action.APPLICATION_RESTRICTIONS_CHANGED") and requires a package name, indicating that it operates at a system or signature level.
- `requestChannelBrowsable` has an access control level of NONE. It also sends a broadcast intent but does not seem to require any specific permissions or operate at a sensitive level.

Given the behavior of `notifyResourceGranted`, particularly its third path where it sends a broadcast intent with a specific permission, and comparing this with the similar APIs:

- The operation does involve sending an intent that could potentially affect multiple applications (given the nature of broadcasting), but it's specifically targeted towards media resource usage.
- It doesn't directly manipulate system settings or sensitive data like `setApplicationRestrictions` does.

However, considering the specific permission required for receiving the broadcast ("android.permission.RECEIVE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_USAGE") and the intent action being related to media resources, this operation might be considered somewhat sensitive but not necessarily at the system or signature level as in `setApplicationRestrictions`.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for the `notifyResourceGranted` API seems to be "NORMAL". This is because it involves a broadcast that could have implications across applications (though specific to media resource usage), and while it's not completely benign (hence not "NONE"), it also doesn't rise to the level of requiring system or signature permissions as seen in more sensitive operations.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `notifyResourceGranted` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
