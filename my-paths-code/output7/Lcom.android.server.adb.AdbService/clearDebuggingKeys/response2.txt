To assign an access control level to the `clearDebuggingKeys` method, we need to consider its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `enablePairingByPairingCode()` and `denyWirelessDebugging()`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The similarity between `clearDebuggingKeys` and these APIs is quite high, with scores of 0.9948785901069641 and 0.9909899830818176, respectively. This suggests that the functionality and possibly the security implications of `clearDebuggingKeys` are closely related to those of `enablePairingByPairingCode()` and `denyWirelessDebugging()`.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it implies that they require a certain level of system or signature protection to be accessed, possibly due to their involvement in debugging or pairing processes which could pose security risks if not properly restricted.

The code snippets provided for `clearDebuggingKeys` and its similar APIs show a pattern where the method checks the state of `mDebuggingManager` and then sends an empty message via `mHandler` if the condition is met. This pattern does not explicitly reveal sensitive data or perform dangerous operations without mediation, but the context suggests that these operations are related to system-level debugging functionalities.

Considering the high similarity scores with APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level and the nature of the operation (clearing debugging keys), which could potentially impact system security or privacy if not properly controlled, it is reasonable to conclude that `clearDebuggingKeys` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `clearDebuggingKeys` API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
