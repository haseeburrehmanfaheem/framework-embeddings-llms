To determine the access control level for the `enablePairingByPairingCode` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The given code snippet for `enablePairingByPairingCode` shows a conditional check for `this.mDebuggingManager == 0`, followed by sending an empty message using `this.mHandler.sendEmptyMessage(15)` if the condition is true. This pattern is similar to the ones observed in the provided APIs, `clearDebuggingKeys()` and `denyWirelessDebugging()`, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The similarity in code structure and the presence of a conditional check related to `this.mDebuggingManager` suggest that `enablePairingByPairingCode` is also involved in managing debugging-related features, potentially requiring system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Given this information and considering the high similarity scores with `clearDebuggingKeys()` (0.9948785901069641) and `denyWirelessDebugging()` (0.9898189306259155), both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that `enablePairingByPairingCode` should also be assigned the same access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `enablePairingByPairingCode` API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
