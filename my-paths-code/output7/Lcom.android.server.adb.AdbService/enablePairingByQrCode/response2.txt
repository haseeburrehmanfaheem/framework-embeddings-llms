To determine the access control level for the `enablePairingByQrCode` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method takes two parameters (`p1` and `p2`) which are checked to be non-empty strings using `Preconditions.checkStringNotEmpty`.
   - It then checks if `this.mDebuggingManager` is equal to 0. If true, it creates a new `Bundle`, puts the input strings into it with keys "serviceName" and "password", and sends this bundle as a message.
   - If `this.mDebuggingManager` is not 0, it directly calls `enablePairingByQrCode` on `this.mDebuggingManager` with the provided parameters.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves creating a `Bundle`, putting sensitive information (service name and password) into it, and then sending this bundle as a message.
   - Directly calling `enablePairingByQrCode` on `this.mDebuggingManager` with potentially sensitive parameters.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `enablePairingByPairingCode()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission to execute.
   - Another similar API, `disablePairing()`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Both of these APIs interact with `this.mDebuggingManager` in a manner similar to `enablePairingByQrCode`, suggesting that operations related to pairing/debugging management are considered sensitive.

Given the above analysis:
- The method handles potentially sensitive information (passwords) and interacts with debugging/pairing management, which is typically restricted.
- Similar APIs (`enablePairingByPairingCode` and `disablePairing`) have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their interaction with sensitive operations.

**Conclusion**: Considering the handling of sensitive data (password) and its similarity in functionality to other APIs that require system or signature-level permissions, the appropriate access control level for `enablePairingByQrCode` should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
