To determine the access control level for the `denyDebugging` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `denyDebugging` method checks if `this.mDebuggingManager` is 0 (or null, depending on the context which isn't fully clear from the snippet), and if so, it sends an empty message with code 4 via `this.mHandler`. If `this.mDebuggingManager` is not 0, it directly calls `denyDebugging` on `this.mDebuggingManager`.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **clearDebuggingKeys()V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.8128337860107422) with `denyDebugging`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, which suggests that operations related to debugging management are considered sensitive.
   - **disablePairing()V**: Although the similarity score (0.729659378528595) is slightly lower than `clearDebuggingKeys()V`, it's still significant and shares the same access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`). This reinforces the notion that methods affecting device or application pairing/debugging state are restricted.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code `this.mDebuggingManager.denyDebugging();` directly interacts with debugging management, suggesting an operation that could potentially impact the security or privacy of the application or device.

Considering these points:
- The operations involved in `denyDebugging`, as well as its similar APIs (`clearDebuggingKeys()V` and `disablePairing()V`), are related to managing debugging states or pairing, which can be considered sensitive from a security perspective.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that such operations require either system-level permissions or signature-level verification to ensure they're executed by trusted parties.

Therefore, given the context and comparisons with similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `denyDebugging` should also be assigned a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
