Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `onReceive` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onReceive` method has a similarity score of 1.0 with two other APIs, which suggests that they are identical or very similar in terms of their code and functionality. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not pose any significant security risks.

Upon examining the code snippet of the `onReceive` method, we can see that it creates a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and starts it. The sink code also shows the same operation. This suggests that the method is primarily responsible for receiving an intent and triggering a specific action in response.

Given the similarity with other APIs having an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the relatively benign nature of the `onReceive` method's functionality, it is reasonable to conclude that this method does not pose significant security risks. Therefore, the appropriate access control level for the `onReceive` method would be `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
