To identify potential sinks in the provided code snippet of the `onReceive` method, we'll follow the guidelines provided. The focus will be on instructions that contribute to a sink based on positive rules such as method invocations, field access and updates, object creation, and data flows.

Given the code:

```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```

Analyzing the instructions:
1. `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);` - This line creates a new object of an anonymous inner class type (`ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`). The creation of this object is directly linked to the input parameters (`p0`, `p2`, `p1`) of the `onReceive` method, suggesting a data flow from these parameters into the newly created object. This action follows one of the positive rules (creation of new objects with dataflow from API parameters).

2. `v1.start();` - This line invokes a method (`start()`) on the object created in the previous step. The invocation is directly related to the object creation and thus continues the data flow initiated by the input parameters.

Both instructions are interconnected through the object `v1`, indicating a coherent set of actions that together form a potential sink, with a clear link between them due to the direct influence of one instruction's output on the next (object creation followed by method invocation on that object).

Therefore, considering these instructions as part of a single sink set due to their data flow connection and adherence to at least one positive rule:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
            "v1.start();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This JSON represents the identified potential sink in the provided code snippet, following the specified format and ensuring that each instruction is directly related to the others through data flow or object interaction.
