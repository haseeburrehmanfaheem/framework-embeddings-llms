To determine the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The given code snippet for `resetTemporaryService` simply calls another instance of itself on `this$0`, passing the parameter `p1`. This suggests a straightforward method call without any explicit security checks or sensitive operations.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code is essentially the same as the method's body, which reinforces that this method directly invokes another method with the same name and parameters. There are no apparent security risks or privacy concerns in this invocation alone.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **resetTemporaryService(I)V**: This API has a similarity score of 1.0 with the given `resetTemporaryService` method, indicating they are essentially identical in terms of functionality. It has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that it does not pose significant security risks.
   - **setTemporaryService(ILjava/lang/String;I)V**: Although this API has a lower similarity score (0.8328460454940796), its access control level is also `NONE`. This method seems to be related in the context of temporary services but involves additional parameters, including a string.

**Conclusion**: Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the straightforward nature of the `resetTemporaryService` method which does not seem to interact with sensitive data or perform critical security operations, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to this API. The method appears to be a simple delegate call without inherent risks.
