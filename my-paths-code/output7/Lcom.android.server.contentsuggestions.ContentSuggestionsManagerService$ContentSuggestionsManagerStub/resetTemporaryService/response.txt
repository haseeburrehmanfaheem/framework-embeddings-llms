Based on the provided code snippet, here's the analysis:

The given method `resetTemporaryService` invokes another method of the same name (`this$0.resetTemporaryService`) with the input parameter `p1`. This invocation follows one of the positive rules: it has naming similarity with the API name and takes the input parameter as an argument.

Since there are no other instructions in this code snippet that contribute to a sink, we consider the entire method invocation as part of a single sink. Here's the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Note that `return;` is not considered a contributing instruction to the sink, as it merely indicates the end of the method. The actual sink is the invocation of `resetTemporaryService` on `this$0`, which processes the input parameter `p1`.
