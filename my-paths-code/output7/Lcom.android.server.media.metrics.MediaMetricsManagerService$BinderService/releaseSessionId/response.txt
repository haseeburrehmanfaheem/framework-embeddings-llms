Since the provided code does not contain any method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that follow at least one of the positive rules, and it only contains a return statement which is essentially an auxiliary operation (doing nothing in this case), there are no sinks to report.

Here's the JSON output reflecting this:

```json
{

}
```

This indicates that there are no identified potential sinks within the provided code snippet.
