Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getRecordingSessionId` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getRecordingSessionId` method generates a random session ID using `SecureRandom` and returns it as a base64-encoded string. The method has two paths with depth 2, but both paths perform similar operations.

The similar APIs, `getTranscodingSessionId` and `getEditingSessionId`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also generate and return session IDs, either by calling `getSessionIdInternal` or using a similar approach to `getRecordingSessionId`.

Considering the similarities between these methods and their access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getRecordingSessionId` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because all these methods are generating and returning session IDs, which do not seem to pose a significant security risk.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getRecordingSessionId` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
