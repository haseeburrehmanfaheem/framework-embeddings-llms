To determine the access control level for the `reportPlaybackMetrics` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `reportPlaybackMetrics` API has three paths, but all of them involve the following steps:

1. Checking the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()`.
2. Getting the media metrics mode from `DeviceConfig.getProperty("media", "media_metrics_mode")`.
3. Setting the atom ID to 320 and building a `StatsEvent` using `StatsEvent$Builder`.
4. Writing the `StatsEvent` to the log using `StatsLog.write(v71)`.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `reportNetworkEvent`: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It also uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and builds a `StatsEvent` with atom ID 321.
2. `notifySignalStrength`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`, but it does not build a `StatsEvent`.

Comparing the code of `reportPlaybackMetrics` with the similar APIs, we can see that it is more similar to `reportNetworkEvent` in terms of its functionality and access control. Both APIs use `Binder.getCallingUid()` and build a `StatsEvent` with a specific atom ID.

However, `reportPlaybackMetrics` also involves checking the media metrics mode and setting the atom ID to 320, which suggests that it may require some level of access control. Nevertheless, the fact that it is similar to `reportNetworkEvent`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, suggests that `reportPlaybackMetrics` may not require a high level of access control.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `reportPlaybackMetrics` API. This is because it involves some checks and builds a `StatsEvent`, but its functionality is similar to `reportNetworkEvent`, which has an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
