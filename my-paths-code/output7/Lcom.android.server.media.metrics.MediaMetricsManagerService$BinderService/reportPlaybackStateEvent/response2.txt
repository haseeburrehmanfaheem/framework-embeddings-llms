To determine the access control level for the `reportPlaybackStateEvent` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `reportPlaybackStateEvent` method writes a `StatsEvent` to the `StatsLog`, which is a sensitive operation. The method checks the calling UID and package name, and only allows the operation if the package is not blocked. This suggests that the method has some level of access control.

Comparing this with the similar APIs, we can see that they also write `StatsEvent` objects to the `StatsLog`, but their access control levels are marked as `NONE`. However, these APIs seem to be reporting different types of events (track change events), and their code is slightly different from the `reportPlaybackStateEvent` method.

Despite these differences, the fact that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` suggests that the `reportPlaybackStateEvent` method may not require a high level of access control. The method's checks on the calling UID and package name may be sufficient to prevent unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the comparison with similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `reportPlaybackStateEvent` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
