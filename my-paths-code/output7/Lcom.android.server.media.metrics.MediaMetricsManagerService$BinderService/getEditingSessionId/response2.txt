To determine the access control level for the `getEditingSessionId` API, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API has two similar APIs: `getTranscodingSessionId(I)Ljava/lang/String;` and `getPlaybackSessionId(I)Ljava/lang/String;`. Both of these have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - The code for `getTranscodingSessionId` directly calls `getSessionIdInternal(p1)` and returns the result, which suggests a straightforward operation without any sensitive or dangerous functionality.
   - The code for `getPlaybackSessionId` generates a random session ID using `SecureRandom`, encodes it as a Base64 string, and then returns this ID. This process involves generating a random identifier but does not directly imply access to sensitive data or performing actions that would require higher access control levels.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The provided sink code snippets show the generation of a random byte array (`[B v2 = new [B(12);`), filling it with random data using `SecureRandom`, and then encoding this data as a Base64 string.
   - These operations are related to generating session IDs, which seems to be the primary purpose of the `getEditingSessionId` method.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically assigned when the API does not access sensitive information or perform critical actions that could impact the system's security or integrity.
   - `NORMAL`: For APIs that require some level of access control but do not deal with highly sensitive data or operations.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Assigned to APIs that can significantly impact the system, such as those accessing sensitive user data, performing financial transactions, etc.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Typically for system-level or signature-protected permissions that are critical and require high privilege levels.

Given the information:
- The similar APIs (`getTranscodingSessionId` and `getPlaybackSessionId`) have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating their operations do not require significant security restrictions.
- The code snippets provided for `getEditingSessionId` involve generating a random session ID, which is similar in nature to the operations performed by its similar APIs. There's no indication that this method accesses sensitive user data or performs actions that would be classified as dangerous.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the similar APIs and the code snippets provided for `getEditingSessionId`, it appears that this method does not perform any operations that would require elevated access control levels such as `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`. The generation and return of a session ID, even with the involvement of `SecureRandom` for randomness, align more closely with the characteristics of APIs labeled as `NONE`, indicating no significant security restrictions are necessary.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getEditingSessionId` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
