Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getUserDataId` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getUserDataId` method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them involve the following key elements:

1. `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`: This suggests that the method is user-specific and may require some form of access control.
2. `AutofillManagerServiceImpl.isCalledByServiceLocked("getUserData", v5)`: This check implies that the method is intended to be called by a specific service, and unauthorized calls may be blocked.
3. `AbstractPerUserSystemService v4 = this.this$0.peekServiceForUserLocked(v1)`: This line indicates that the method interacts with a per-user service, which may have its own access control mechanisms.

The similar APIs provided also offer insights into the expected access control level:

* `getUserData(Lcom/android/internal/os/IResultReceiver;)V` has an access control level of `NONE`, but its code is very similar to the `getUserDataId` method. This suggests that the `getUserDataId` method may not require strict access control.
* `getDefaultFieldClassificationAlgorithm(Lcom/android/internal(os/IResultReceiver;)V` also has an access control level of `NONE`, and its code involves a similar user-specific check using `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`.

Considering these factors, I conclude that the `getUserDataId` method does not require strict access control, as it is primarily focused on retrieving user data and interacting with per-user services. The presence of checks like `AutofillManagerServiceImpl.isCalledByServiceLocked` suggests that some form of access control is already implemented within the method.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getUserDataId` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
