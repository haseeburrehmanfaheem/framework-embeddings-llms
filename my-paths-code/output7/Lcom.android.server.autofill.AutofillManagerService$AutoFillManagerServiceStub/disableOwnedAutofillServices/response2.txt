Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method has three paths with depth 2, and it interacts with the following sinks:

1. `AbstractPerUserSystemService v3 = this.this$0.peekServiceForUserLocked(p1);`
2. `boolean v26 = Settings$Secure.putStringForUser(v25, "autofill_service", 0, AbstractPerUserSystemService.mUserId);`

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `setAutofillFailure(ILjava/util/List;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.8829965591430664 and an access control level of NONE.
2. `cancelSession(II)V` with a similarity score of 0.8444675207138062 and an access control level of NONE.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or access controls to function. However, the `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method interacts with the `Settings$Secure` class, which is a secure settings provider that requires appropriate permissions to modify settings.

Considering the interactions with the sinks and the similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of NORMAL to the `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method. This is because the method modifies secure settings, but it does not require any sensitive or dangerous permissions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
