To determine the access control level for the `removePrimaryClipChangedListener` API, let's analyze its code paths and compare them with the similar APIs provided.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Both path 1 and path 2 of `removePrimaryClipChangedListener` involve retrieving or manipulating the clipboard data specific to a user (identified by `p2`) and removing a listener (`p1`). 
   - The method uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `UserHandle.getUserId(v3)` to identify the calling user, which is crucial for determining the access control level.
   - The presence of `ClipboardService$PerUserClipboard` and its methods suggests that this API interacts with sensitive data (clipboard contents) on a per-user basis.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **addPrimaryClipChangedListener**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It adds a listener for primary clip changes, which implies it needs to ensure only authorized or system processes can monitor clipboard changes.
   - **getPrimaryClip**: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method retrieves the current primary clip data, which is sensitive and should be protected from unauthorized access.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both similar APIs (`addPrimaryClipChangedListener` and `getPrimaryClip`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their interaction with sensitive user data (clipboard contents).
   - The `removePrimaryClipChangedListener` method, while not directly accessing clipboard data like `getPrimaryClip`, does interact with the management of listeners for clipboard changes. This suggests it needs to be secured against unauthorized removal of listeners, which could potentially be used to bypass security measures or disrupt service functionality.

Given these points, the most appropriate access control level for `removePrimaryClipChangedListener` is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because:
- The method interacts with sensitive data management (clipboard listeners) on a per-user basis.
- Similar APIs that interact with clipboard data or its listeners have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating the need to restrict access to system or signature-protected processes.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
