To determine the access control level for the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method, we should analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs provided, specifically focusing on how they interact with sensitive operations or data.

The `stopPrinterDiscovery` method has two paths, but both are conditioned by `if (1 == 0)`, which means in practice, this method does not execute any of the code within these conditions. However, for the purpose of analysis and considering the structure of the provided paths:

1. **Analysis of Code Paths**: Both paths involve checking if the user is unlocking or unlocked (`this.mUserManager.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p1)`), retrieving or creating a `UserState` object, and then performing operations related to printer discovery sessions (stopping or managing these sessions). These operations are somewhat sensitive as they relate to device settings and interactions with external devices (printers).

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar APIs (`destroyPrinterDiscoverySession` and `createPrinterDiscoverySession`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the system considers these operations to be relatively safe or not sensitive enough to require higher levels of access control.
   - These APIs also interact with user states and printer discovery sessions, which is similar to what `stopPrinterDiscovery` does in its paths.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Implies that the operation does not pose significant risks or handle sensitive data directly.
   - `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, and `SYS_OR_SIG` imply increasing levels of sensitivity, with `DANGEROUS` typically involving direct access to sensitive user data or system settings and `SYS_OR_SIG` being restricted to system or signature applications.

Given that the similar APIs (`destroyPrinterDiscoverySession` and `createPrinterDiscoverySession`) have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of operations within `stopPrinterDiscovery` (which, despite its conditional execution, deals with managing printer discovery sessions and user states), it's reasonable to conclude that this method also does not require a high level of access control.

However, since both paths in `stopPrinterDiscovery` are under the condition `if (1 == 0)`, which means they do not actually execute, we must consider what this implies for access control. In practice, because the method does not perform any actual operations due to its conditional structure, it could be argued that it poses no risk. Yet, for consistency with how similar APIs are treated and considering the method's intended functionality (were it to be executed), aligning with those APIs seems logical.

**Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the analysis of both code paths and similar APIs, the access control level for `stopPrinterDiscovery` should be consistent with its peers in terms of functionality and risk profile.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the method's operational similarity to other `NONE` access control level methods and considering that, despite its conditional execution, it does not execute sensitive operations outside the scope of those similar methods.
