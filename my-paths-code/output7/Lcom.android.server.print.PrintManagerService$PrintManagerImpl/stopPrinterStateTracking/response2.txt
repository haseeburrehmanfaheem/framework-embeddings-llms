After analyzing the provided information, we can see that the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method has two paths with similar code snippets. The method interacts with the same sinks as the similar APIs, specifically `UserState v9 = new UserState(this.mContext,p1,this.mLock,p2);` and `this.mUserStates.put(p1, v9);`.

The similar API `validatePrinters(Ljava/util/List;I)V` has an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that it does not require any special permissions to access the sinks. On the other hand, the similar API `getPrintJobInfos(II)Ljava/util/List;` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permissions to access the sinks.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method does not actually perform any sensitive operations that would require system or signature-level permissions. The method only stops printer state tracking and removes the printer from the tracked printers list.

Considering the similarities with the `validatePrinters(Ljava/util/List;I)V` API, which has an access control level of `NONE`, and the fact that the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method does not perform any sensitive operations, we can conclude that the access control level for the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method should be `NORMAL`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
