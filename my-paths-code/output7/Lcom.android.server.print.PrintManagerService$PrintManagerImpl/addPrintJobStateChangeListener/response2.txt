To determine the access control level for the `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The given API interacts with user states and listener records, which are also present in the similar APIs. The similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions.

Looking at the code snippets of the similar APIs, we can see that they all involve creating a new `UserState` object and adding a listener record to a list (`mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords`). The `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` method also performs similar operations:

1. Creating a new `UserState` object: `UserState v10 = new UserState(this.mContext, p1, this.mLock, p2);`
2. Putting the `UserState` object into a map: `this.mUserStates.put(p1, v10);`
3. Adding a listener record to a list: `boolean v21 = this.mPrintJobStateChangeListenerRecords.add(v19);`

Given these similarities and the fact that the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to the `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` method.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
