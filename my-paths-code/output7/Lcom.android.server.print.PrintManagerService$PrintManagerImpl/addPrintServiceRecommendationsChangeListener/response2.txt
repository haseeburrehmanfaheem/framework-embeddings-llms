To determine the access control level for the `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method modifies user states by adding a new listener (`IRecommendationsChangeListener`) and interacts with user management and locking mechanisms. It also involves creating or getting an existing `UserState` object and putting it into `mUserStates`. This suggests that the method deals with sensitive operations related to user data and system services.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with `UserState` objects, including retrieval and creation, which are crucial for managing user-specific data and behaviors within the print service recommendations. These operations could potentially affect system behavior or user data confidentiality/integrity.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **startPrinterStateTracking**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9940107464790344) with `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` but is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Its code snippet shows similar operations related to user states, suggesting that these operations might not be considered dangerous or requiring special permissions in this context.
   - **removePrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener**: With a similarity score of 0.9471195340156555, this API is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission. Its code involves similar user state management operations.

Given these points:

- The method's interactions with sensitive data (user states and listener additions) suggest a potential need for elevated permissions.
- However, the highly similar API (`startPrinterStateTracking`) has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that perhaps these operations are not as critical or dangerous as they initially seem.
- The presence of system service interactions (e.g., `RemotePrintServiceRecommendationService`) and user state management could imply a need for careful access control.

Considering the balance between the potential sensitivity of the operations performed by `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` and the comparisons with similar APIs, it seems that while the method does interact with system services and user data, its similarity to an API with `NONE` access control level suggests it might not require the highest level of access control (`DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`) unless specific contextual factors (not detailed in the provided information) elevate its risk profile.

However, without explicit indication that this method poses a significant risk to user data or system integrity that would warrant `NONE` or necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering it involves adding a listener which might not be as risky as removing one (which has `SYS_OR_SIG`), a cautious approach might lean towards `NORMAL` access control, acknowledging the method's interactions with system components and user data without clear evidence of high-risk operations.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision reflects a balance between the potential risks associated with managing user states and interacting with system services, and the observed access control levels of similar APIs.
