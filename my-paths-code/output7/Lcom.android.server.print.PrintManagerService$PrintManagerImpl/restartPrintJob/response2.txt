To determine the access control level for the `restartPrintJob` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the sinks it interacts with, and compare these aspects with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

### Analysis of restartPrintJob Method

1. **Interaction with Sinks**: The method interacts with several sinks:
   - `UserState v10 = new UserState(this.mContext,p1,this.mLock,p2);`
   - `this.mPrintJobForAppCache.getPrintJob(p1, p2);`
   - `this.mSpooler.getPrintJobInfo(p1, p2);`

   These interactions suggest that the method is involved in managing print jobs and user states, which could potentially impact system resources or user data.

2. **Conditional Logic**: The method's logic is wrapped in a condition `if (1 == 0)`, which means it will never execute as written. However, for the purpose of analysis, we consider what would happen if this condition were true. It checks user unlock status, updates user states, and attempts to restart print jobs under certain conditions.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **cancelPrintJob**: This method has a similarity score of 0.9529328942298889 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with the spooler to cancel print jobs, which suggests that modifying or controlling print jobs requires system or signature-level permissions.
   - **removePrintJobStateChangeListener**: With a similarity score of 0.8934059143066406, this method has an access control level of `NONE`. It removes a listener for print job state changes, which doesn't seem to directly impact system resources or sensitive data in the same way as controlling print jobs.

### Determining Access Control Level

Given that `restartPrintJob` is closely related to managing and controlling print jobs (similar to `cancelPrintJob`), and considering it interacts with system components like the spooler, we can infer that it likely requires a level of access control similar to `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because both methods deal with operations that could potentially impact system resources or are sensitive in nature (e.g., restarting print jobs could interfere with other system processes or user activities).

However, since the method as provided does not actually execute due to its conditional logic (`if (1 == 0)`), one might argue about its practical implications. Still, based on the structure and intended interactions, it's logical to align its access control level with that of similar operational methods like `cancelPrintJob`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the method's interactions, comparison with similar APIs, and considering the typical requirements for system-level operations:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This conclusion assumes that the conditional logic preventing execution is either a placeholder or an error in the provided code snippet, and the method is intended to perform actions similar to those of `cancelPrintJob`.
