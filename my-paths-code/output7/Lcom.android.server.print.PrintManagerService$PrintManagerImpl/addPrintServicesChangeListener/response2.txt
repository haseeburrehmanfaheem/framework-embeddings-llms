To determine the access control level for the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided `addPrintServicesChangeListener` method involves several operations:
1. It checks if a user is unlocking or unlocked.
2. It creates a new `UserState` object and puts it into `mUserStates`.
3. It initializes an `ArrayList` for `mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords` and adds a listener to it.

The sink code indicates interactions with `UserState` objects, modification of `mUserStates`, and manipulation of `mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords`.

Given the similar APIs:
- `removePrintServicesChangeListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its operations include destroying a `UserState` object and removing from `mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords`.
- `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves getting or creating a `UserState`, adding a listener to `mPrintJobStateChangeListenerRecords`.

Both similar APIs interact with sensitive system resources (like user states and listener records) and have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to execute. The operations in `addPrintServicesChangeListener`, such as adding listeners and manipulating user states, are comparable in terms of potential impact on system security and privacy.

Given this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that `addPrintServicesChangeListener` should have a similar access control level due to its interactions with system resources and the need to protect these operations from unauthorized access.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the method's potential to affect system security and user privacy, aligning with the access control levels of similar APIs that interact with analogous system resources.
