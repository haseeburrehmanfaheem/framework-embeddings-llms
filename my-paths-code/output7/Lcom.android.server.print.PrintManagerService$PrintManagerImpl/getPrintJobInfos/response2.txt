To determine the access control level for the `getPrintJobInfos` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths (path 1 and path 2) with depth 2, indicating complex logic involving user states, print jobs, and potential interactions with remote print spoolers. Both paths involve checking user unlock status, manipulating user states, and interacting with print job information.

2. **Sink Code**: The provided sink code snippets indicate operations related to retrieving print jobs for an app and caching them, as well as creating and storing `UserState` objects. These operations seem to be internal to the printing service and do not directly imply dangerous operations like accessing sensitive user data or performing actions that could harm the system.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **validatePrinters**: This API has a similarity score of 1.0 with `getPrintJobInfos` and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Its code snippet shows creation and storage of a `UserState` object, similar to parts of the `getPrintJobInfos` method.
   - **stopPrinterStateTracking**: Also with a similarity score of 1.0 and an access control level of `NONE`, this API's code involves creating and storing a `UserState` object, akin to the operations in `getPrintJobInfos`.

Given these points:

- The `getPrintJobInfos` method does not appear to perform any inherently dangerous operations (like directly accessing sensitive data or executing commands that could compromise system security) based on the provided paths and sink code.
- The similar APIs (`validatePrinters` and `stopPrinterStateTracking`) are assigned an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that their operations, which involve user state management similar to parts of `getPrintJobInfos`, do not require elevated permissions or strict access controls.

Therefore, considering the internal nature of the operations performed by `getPrintJobInfos` and the similarity with other APIs that have been assigned a `NONE` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that `getPrintJobInfos` should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level:**
