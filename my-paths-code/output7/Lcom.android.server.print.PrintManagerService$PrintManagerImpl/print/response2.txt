Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `print` method.

The `print` method interacts with the `PrintJobInfo` object, which is a sensitive resource. The method also uses the `Binder.getCallingUid()` function to get the UID of the calling process and checks if the package name matches the one in the `PackageManager`. This suggests that the method is performing some kind of authentication or authorization.

The similar APIs provided, `isPrintServiceEnabled` and `destroyPrinterDiscoverySession`, both have an access control level of `NONE`. However, these methods do not interact with sensitive resources like `PrintJobInfo`.

Upon closer inspection of the sink code, we can see that it creates a new `PrintJobInfo` object and sets its properties. This suggests that the `print` method is creating a new print job, which could potentially be a sensitive operation.

Considering the sensitivity of the operation and the fact that the method interacts with sensitive resources, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `print` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

Note: The choice of `NORMAL` over `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` is based on the fact that while the method does interact with sensitive resources, it does not appear to be performing any extremely sensitive operations that would require a higher level of access control. Additionally, the similar APIs provided do not have a higher access control level, which suggests that this level of sensitivity is typical for this type of operation.
