To determine the access control level for the `removePrintServicesChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with depth 2, but both are essentially controlled by the condition `if (1 == 0)`, which means neither path is actually executed because this condition is always false. However, we can infer the intended behavior from the structure and the presence of similar APIs.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate operations such as creating a new `UserState` object, putting it into `mUserStates`, destroying an object (`v16.destroy()`), removing an item from `mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords`, and calling `removePrintServicesChangeListener` on another object (`v6.removePrintServicesChangeListener(p1)`). These operations suggest interactions with user states and listener records, which are typical in managing print services.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **addPrintServicesChangeListener**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9328) with `removePrintServicesChangeListener`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission. The code involves creating a new `UserState` and adding a listener record.
   - **addPrintJobStateChangeListener**: Although its similarity score (0.8996) is slightly lower, it also operates at the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, involving similar operations like creating a `UserState` and adding a listener.

Given these points:

- The method's execution paths are currently non-operational due to the `if (1 == 0)` condition, but its structure and naming suggest it should manage print service change listeners.
- Similar APIs (`addPrintServicesChangeListener` and `addPrintJobStateChangeListener`) that also deal with managing listener records have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The sink code suggests operations that would typically require permission to manage system resources or user data.

Therefore, considering the method's purpose is likely to remove a print service change listener (a operation complementary to adding one), and given the context provided by similar APIs, it's reasonable to infer that managing such listeners requires system-level permissions to ensure proper access control over user and system resources.

The final access control level for the `removePrintServicesChangeListener` API would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the need to protect system resources and user data from unauthorized access, consistent with the permissions required by similar APIs involved in adding listeners.
