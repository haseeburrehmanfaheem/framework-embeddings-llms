After analyzing the provided Java code for the Android API `onApplicationActive`, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean v3 = this.mUnlockedUsers.get(p2);",
      "boolean v4 = this.mUserManagerInternal.isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(p2);",
      "ShortcutPackage v16 = ShortcutUser.getPackageShortcutsIfExists(p1);",
      "ShortcutPackage v17 = new ShortcutPackage(ShortcutUser, this.mUserId, p1);",
      "Object v19 = this.mPackages.put(p1, v17);",
      "v5.resetRateLimitingForCommandLineNoSaving();",
      "FileOutputStream v30 = v28.startWrite();",
      "TypedXmlSerializer v32 = Xml.newFastSerializer();",
      "v36.saveToXml(, 0);"
    ],
    [
      "ShortcutUser v6 = ShortcutService.getUserShortcutsLocked(p2);",
      "ShortcutPackage v7 = v6.getPackageShortcuts(p1);",
      "this.mApiCallCount = 0;",
      "this.mLastResetTime = 0;",
      "FileOutputStream v15 = v13.startWrite();",
      "ShortcutService.saveUserInternalLocked(p2, v15, 0);"
    ],
    [
      "ShortcutPackage v3 = p0.getPackageShortcutsLocked(p1, p2);",
      "v3.resetRateLimitingForCommandLineNoSaving();",
      "p0.saveUserLocked(p2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on the complexity and potential impact of the operations performed. The first sink is the most sensitive as it involves creating a new `ShortcutPackage` object, writing to a file, and saving user data. The second sink is less sensitive but still involves accessing and modifying user data. The third sink is the least sensitive as it only resets rate limiting for command-line usage and saves user-locked data.

Each instruction in the identified sinks follows at least one of the positive rules:

1. Method invocations with naming similarity to the API name or taking input parameters as arguments.
2. Field access and updates with naming similarity to the API name.
3. Creation of new objects with naming similarity to the API or using data flow from API parameters.

Note that some instructions, such as logging statements and auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining an instance of a class), are not included in the identified sinks as they do not follow the positive rules or are considered less sensitive.
