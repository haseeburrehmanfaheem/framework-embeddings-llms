To assign an access control level to the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code for `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` shows that it interacts with package managers, checks user unlock status, and handles shortcut packages. It also calls methods like `injectClearCallingIdentity`, which suggests a level of system interaction typically reserved for more privileged operations.

Comparing this to the similar APIs:

1. **removeLongLivedShortcuts**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and includes interactions with package managers and shortcut users, similar to `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`. The similarity score is high (0.9975000619888306), indicating a strong resemblance in functionality.

2. **pushDynamicShortcut**: Also having an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this API involves getting package UIDs and interacting with shortcut packages, which are operations that require significant system privileges to execute securely and correctly.

Given these similarities and the nature of the operations performed by `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` (e.g., clearing calling identity, checking user status, managing shortcuts), it's reasonable to infer that this method also requires a high level of access control. The fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` further supports this conclusion.

**Access Control Decision:**
Considering the code's functionality and its similarity to other APIs with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is logical to assign the same level to `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`. This ensures consistency in security policies across similar system interactions and maintains the integrity of shortcut management functions within the Android framework.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege, ensuring that `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` can perform its necessary operations securely while adhering to established access control standards for similar methods within the system.
