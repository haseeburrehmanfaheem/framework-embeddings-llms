To assign an access control level to the `disableShortcuts` API, let's analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `disableShortcuts` API has three paths, but they all seem to follow a similar pattern. It checks for ephemeral apps, ensures that shortcut IDs are provided, and then proceeds to disable shortcuts based on certain conditions.

Comparing this API with the similar ones:

1. `enableShortcuts`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code is similar to `disableShortcuts` in terms of verifying the caller and ensuring immutable shortcuts are not included with IDs.
2. `pushDynamicShortcut`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code verifies the caller and ensures that a shortcut is not immutable before pushing it.

Both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, which suggests that they require either system-level or signature-level permissions to execute. The `disableShortcuts` API seems to follow a similar pattern in terms of its functionality and code structure.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `disableShortcuts` API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity in code patterns and functionality between `disableShortcuts` and the other two APIs, which both require system-level or signature-level permissions.
