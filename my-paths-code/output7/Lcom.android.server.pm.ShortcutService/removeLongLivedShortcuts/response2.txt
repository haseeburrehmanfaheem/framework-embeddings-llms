Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method has a similarity score of 0.9975 with the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method may also require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method has a similarity score of 0.9326 with the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method may require a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

The sink code provided also suggests that the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method is interacting with sensitive data, such as package UIDs and shortcut information, which may require elevated access control.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
