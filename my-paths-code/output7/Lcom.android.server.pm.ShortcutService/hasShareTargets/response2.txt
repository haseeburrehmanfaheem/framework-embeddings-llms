Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `hasShareTargets` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `hasShareTargets` method appears to be related to shortcut management and user unlocking. It checks if a package has share targets for a specific user and returns a boolean value indicating whether share targets are available.

The similar APIs provided, `getShareTargets` and `onApplicationActive`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs seem to be related to shortcut management, user unlocking, and package interactions, which is similar to the functionality of the `hasShareTargets` method.

The code snippets for these similar APIs show that they also interact with unlocked users, shortcut packages, and user managers, which suggests that they require a similar level of access control.

Considering the similarities between the `hasShareTargets` method and the provided APIs, I conclude that the `hasShareTargets` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the `hasShareTargets` method requires system or signature-level permissions to access and manage shortcut-related data, ensuring that only authorized components can interact with this functionality.
