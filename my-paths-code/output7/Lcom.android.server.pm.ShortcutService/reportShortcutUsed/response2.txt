To determine the access control level for the `reportShortcutUsed` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `reportShortcutUsed` API interacts with various system components, such as the package manager, user manager, and usage stats manager. It also performs checks on the app's ephemeral status and user unlocking state.

Comparing this API with the similar ones:

1. `enableShortcuts`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9683862328529358 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also interacts with the package manager, shortcut service, and performs checks on ephemeral apps.
2. `pushDynamicShortcut`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9449498653411865 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with the package manager, shortcut service, and gets shortcuts for a specific package.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive data and perform operations.

The `reportShortcutUsed` API also performs sensitive operations, such as reporting shortcut usage and interacting with the usage stats manager. Given its similarities with the other two APIs and its interactions with system components, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this API.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `reportShortcutUsed` API is protected by system or signature-level permission, preventing unauthorized access and misuse.
