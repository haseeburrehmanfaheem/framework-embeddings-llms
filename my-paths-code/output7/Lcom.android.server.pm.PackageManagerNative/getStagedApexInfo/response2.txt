To determine the access control level for the `getStagedApexInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getStagedApexModuleNames()`: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It retrieves a list of staged APEX module names, which seems to be a relatively safe operation that doesn't directly manipulate sensitive data or system settings.
   - `unregisterStagedApexObserver(IStagedApexObserver)`: Also has an access control level of `NONE`. This method is used to unregister an observer for staged APEX events, which, like the first API, does not appear to pose a significant risk in terms of data privacy or system integrity.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The provided sink code snippets involve the creation of `ApexSessionParams`, interaction with `StagingManager` to get staged APEX infos, and the retrieval of specific staged APEX info based on input parameters. These operations seem to be focused on managing or querying staged APEX sessions without directly accessing sensitive user data or performing actions that could compromise system security.

3. **Method Code Analysis**:
   - The `getStagedApexInfo` method involves checking the readiness and destruction status of sessions, handling parent session IDs, and retrieving specific APEX info based on the input parameter `p1`. It interacts with `StagingManager` and `ApexSessionParams` but does not seem to perform any operations that would be classified as dangerous (e.g., executing commands, accessing sensitive data without permission).

Given these observations:

- The method and its similar APIs do not seem to perform actions that could directly compromise user privacy or system security.
- The interactions are primarily with system services and parameters related to APEX sessions, which are managed within the context of the `StagingManager`.
- There is no indication of direct access to sensitive data (like location, contacts, etc.) or performing operations that require higher privilege levels (e.g., sending SMS, making calls).

Therefore, considering the provided information and the nature of the similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `getStagedApexInfo` method would be `NONE`, as it aligns with the access control levels of the similar APIs and does not appear to engage in activities that necessitate higher security clearance.
