Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `onReceive` method. 

The `onReceive` method appears to be handling intents related to master clear and factory reset operations. It checks for specific actions and extras in the intent, such as "android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR" and "android.intent.extra.WIPE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE". If certain conditions are met, it performs actions like wiping external storage and resetting the device.

The sink code provided shows that the method is accessing sensitive data, such as the wipe external storage flag and the reason for the master clear operation. It also creates new objects, like `MasterClearReceiver$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`, which suggests that it may be performing privileged operations.

However, when comparing this to the similar APIs provided, we see that they have an access control level of "NONE". These similar APIs seem to be related to config update install receivers and do not appear to handle sensitive data or perform privileged operations.

Given this information, it seems that the `onReceive` method is handling more sensitive data and performing more privileged operations than the similar APIs. However, since the similar APIs have an access control level of "NONE", it's likely that the `onReceive` method should also have a relatively low access control level.

Considering the options provided (NONE, NORMAL, DANGEROUS, SYS_OR_SIG), I would assign an access control level of "NORMAL" to the `onReceive` method. This is because while it does handle sensitive data and perform privileged operations, it does not appear to require the highest level of access control (SYS_OR_SIG) or pose a significant risk to the system (DANGEROUS).

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
