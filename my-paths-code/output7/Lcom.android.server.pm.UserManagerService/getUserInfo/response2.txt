To determine the access control level for the `getUserInfo` method, we'll analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `getUserInfo` method has three code paths (path 1, path 2, and path 3) with a depth of 2. All paths involve retrieving user information based on the input parameter `p1`. The key operations in these paths include:

1. Retrieving a user object from `this.mUsers.get(p1)`.
2. Checking if the user ID is being removed (`this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1)`).
3. Creating a new `UserInfo` object under certain conditions.

The sink code provided highlights interactions with user data, including getting a user by ID, checking guest status, and creating new user info objects.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- The `canHaveRestrictedProfile(I)Z` API has a high similarity score (above 0.9), indicating its operations are closely related to those of `getUserInfo`. This API checks for restricted profiles and involves similar operations like retrieving users by ID and checking their status (guest, profile, restricted).

Given that the similar APIs (`canHaveRestrictedProfile(I)Z`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we should consider why this level was assigned to them. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that the API is either system-internal or signature-protected, suggesting it's not directly accessible to all applications but rather restricted to system-level components or those with a specific signature.

Considering the operations of `getUserInfo` and its similarity to `canHaveRestrictedProfile(I)Z`, which involves sensitive user information handling (retrieving user data, checking statuses), it's reasonable to conclude that `getUserInfo` should also have a restrictive access control level. This is because accessing or manipulating user information can have significant implications for privacy and security.

Given the options:

- `NONE`: Implies no restrictions, which seems inappropriate given the sensitivity of user data.
- `NORMAL`: Suggests a standard level of access control, which might not be sufficient for operations involving sensitive user information.
- `DANGEROUS`: Indicates a level of risk but doesn't necessarily imply system-level or signature protection.
- `SYS_OR_SIG`: Implies system-internal or signature-protected access, aligning with the need to restrict access to sensitive user data handling.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
