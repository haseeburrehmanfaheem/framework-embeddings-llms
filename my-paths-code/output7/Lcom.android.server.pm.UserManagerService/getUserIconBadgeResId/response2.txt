To assign an access control level to the `getUserIconBadgeResId` API, we must carefully review its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs with their assigned access control levels.

The provided `getUserIconBadgeResId` method appears to interact with user information and badge details. It retrieves a user's info using `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)`, attempts to get the user type details, and checks if the user type has a badge before returning the icon badge resource ID.

Looking at the similar APIs:

1. **`getUserBadgeResId(I)I`** with an access control level of **`SYS_OR_SIG`**: This API is very similar in terms of functionality, as it also deals with retrieving a badge-related resource ID. The key similarity lies in how both methods interact with user types and badges.

2. **`hasBadge(I)Z`** with an access control level of **`SYS_OR_SIG`**: Although this method only checks if a badge exists without returning its resource ID, the underlying interactions with `UserManagerService` and user type details are analogous to those in `getUserIconBadgeResId`.

Given these similarities and considering that all these methods seem to require some level of system or signature protection to access and manipulate user information securely, it's reasonable to conclude that `getUserIconBadgeResId` should also be assigned a similar level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getUserIconBadgeResId` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects the method's need for protected access to user data and badge information, aligning with the security considerations evident in the similar APIs provided.
