To determine the access control level for the `isUserNameSet` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `isUserNameSet` method interacts with user data through the `mUsers` and `mRemovingUserIds` objects, which are also accessed by the similar APIs (`isUserOfType` and `getProfileParent`). These similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to access the user data.

Given the similarity in code structure and the interaction with the same sinks (e.g., `this.mUsers.get(p1)` and `this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1)`), it's reasonable to infer that the `isUserNameSet` method should have a similar access control level. The method is checking if a user name is set, which involves accessing user information, a sensitive operation that typically requires some level of permission.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of the operation (accessing user data), the `isUserNameSet` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
