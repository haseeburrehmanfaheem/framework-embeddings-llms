To determine the access control level for the `getUserStartRealtime` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with similar logic, both involving getting the calling user ID and checking if the user data is available or being removed. If specific conditions are met, it returns a value related to the user's start time in real-time.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets all involve getting the calling user ID, retrieving user data based on this ID, and under certain conditions (like the user data not being found or the user being partially removed), returning a specific real-time value associated with the user.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two instances of `getUserUnlockRealtime()` are provided, both with high similarity scores to `getUserStartRealtime`. Their access control levels are both `NONE`.
   - These similar APIs follow a logic pattern that is very close to `getUserStartRealtime`, involving checks for user data and returning real-time values under specific conditions.

Given these points:

- The logic of `getUserStartRealtime` closely resembles that of the provided similar APIs (`getUserUnlockRealtime()`), which both have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The method does not seem to perform any operations that would typically require elevated permissions (like modifying system settings, accessing sensitive data without permission, etc.). It primarily involves retrieving and returning information based on the calling user's ID.
- The presence of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `UserHandle.getUserId(v1)` suggests it is designed to work within the context of user management and access control, but these are used for identification purposes rather than to perform dangerous operations.

Based on this analysis and considering the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `getUserStartRealtime` does not pose significant risks or require special permissions beyond what is normally granted.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
