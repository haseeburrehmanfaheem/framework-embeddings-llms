To determine the access control level for the `removeUserWhenPossible` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `removeUserWhenPossible` method has three paths, but all of them involve removing a user from the system. The key actions include:

1. Retrieving a user object from `this.mUsers.get(p1)`.
2. Adding the user ID to `this.mRemovingUserIds`.
3. Writing user data to a file using `UserManagerService.writeUserLP(v13, v37)`.
4. Removing the user from `this.mAppOpsService`.

The similar APIs provided, `removeUserEvenWhenDisallowed(I)Z`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also involve removing users and share similarities in their operations, such as:

1. Retrieving a user object.
2. Adding the user ID to a list of removing user IDs.
3. Writing user data.
4. Removing the user from app ops service.

Given these similarities and considering that all paths of `removeUserWhenPossible` involve critical operations related to user management (which typically require significant permissions or system-level access), it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a high level of access control.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the sensitive nature of user removal operations, the access control level for `removeUserWhenPossible` should be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs and reflects the need for system or signature-level permissions to perform such actions.
