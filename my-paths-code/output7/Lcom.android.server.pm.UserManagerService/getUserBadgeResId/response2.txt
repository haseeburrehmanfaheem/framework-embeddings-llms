To determine the access control level for the `getUserBadgeResId` API, let's analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getUserBadgeResId` API interacts with the following sinks:
1. `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)`: This is a call to retrieve user information.
2. `this.mUserTypes.get(v3)`: This retrieves a user type based on a specific key.
3. `v2.hasBadge()`: Checks if a badge exists for the user type.
4. `v2.getBadgePlain()`: Retrieves the plain badge resource ID.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:
- `getUserIconBadgeResId(I)I` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code is very similar, interacting with the same sinks (`UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)`, `this.mUserTypes.get(v3)`, and checking for a badge but retrieving the icon badge instead).
- `hasBadge(I)Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It checks if a badge exists, interacting with similar sinks (`UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` and `this.mUserTypes.get(v3)`).

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the semantics of these APIs which involve retrieving user-specific information (badges or icons) that could potentially be sensitive, it suggests that accessing such detailed user information might require system or signature-level permissions to ensure privacy and security.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the access control levels of the provided similar APIs, the `getUserBadgeResId` API should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
