To determine the access control level for the `hasBadge` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `hasBadge` method interacts with the `UserManagerService` and `UserTypeDetails` classes, which are also present in the similar APIs. The method checks if a user has a badge by calling `getUserInfoLU` and then retrieving the user type details using `getUserTypeDetailsNoChecks`. Finally, it calls the `hasBadge` method on the `UserTypeDetails` object.

The two similar APIs, `getUserBadgeResId` and `getUserIconBadgeResId`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the same classes and perform similar operations, such as retrieving user information and checking for badges. The main difference is that they return a resource ID instead of a boolean value.

Given the similarities between the `hasBadge` method and the two provided APIs, it can be inferred that the access control level for `hasBadge` should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because all three methods are interacting with sensitive user information and require a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.

The final access control level for the `hasBadge` API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
