To determine the access control level for the `getUserRestrictionSources` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - Two similar APIs are mentioned with a high similarity score (above 0.85), both having an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that these APIs, which seem to interact with user restriction sources in a manner similar to the API in question, require either system or signature-level permissions to be accessed.

2. **Code Snippets and Sinks:**
   - The provided code snippets for `getUserRestrictionSources` show interactions with `UserManager$EnforcingUser`, `RestrictionsSet`, and accessing user restrictions based on various conditions. These operations imply a level of sensitivity regarding user data and device policy.
   - The sink codes provided further emphasize the interaction with sensitive data, such as getting device policy local restrictions for target users and checking boolean values from restriction bundles.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Given that similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it suggests that operations related to user restriction sources are considered sensitive.
   - The code snippets of `getUserRestrictionSources` and the sink codes demonstrate handling of potentially sensitive information (user restrictions, device policy details), which would typically require protection against unauthorized access.

4. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   - Considering the sensitivity of the operations performed by `getUserRestrictionSources` and the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that this API should also have a restrictive access control level.
   - The involvement of system-level information (like user restrictions and device policy) points towards the need for either system or signature-level permissions to ensure that only authorized components can access these sensitive operations.

Based on this analysis, the `getUserRestrictionSources` API should be assigned an access control level that reflects its sensitivity and the need for protection against unauthorized access. Given the context provided by similar APIs and the nature of the operations involved, `SYS_OR_SIG` appears to be the most appropriate access control level.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment aligns with the protection of sensitive user and device policy data, ensuring that only system-level or signature-verified components can interact with these APIs.
