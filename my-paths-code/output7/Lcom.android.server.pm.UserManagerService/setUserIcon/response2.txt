To determine the access control level for the `setUserIcon` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves setting a user icon for a specific user ID (`p1`) with a given bitmap (`p2`). It checks if the user data exists and handles cases where the user info might be partial or not found.

2. **Sink Code**: The sinks indicate interactions with `UserManagerService` methods, specifically `setUserIcon` and `getUserDataNoChecks`, which suggest operations related to user management and data retrieval.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `findCurrentGuestUser()`: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It is used to find the current guest user, indicating a need for system or signature-level permission due to its interaction with sensitive user information.
   - `getPrimaryUser()`: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that operations related to identifying primary users require elevated permissions.

Given these points:

- The `setUserIcon` method involves modifying user data, which is a sensitive operation. Modifying user icons could potentially be used in phishing attacks or to mislead users about the identity of accounts on their device.
- The similar APIs (`findCurrentGuestUser` and `getPrimaryUser`) deal with retrieving specific types of user information and are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, indicating that operations related to user management are considered sensitive.

Considering these factors, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setUserIcon` method seems appropriate. This is because it involves modifying user data, which requires a level of trust and permission typically reserved for system or signature-level accesses to prevent misuse.
