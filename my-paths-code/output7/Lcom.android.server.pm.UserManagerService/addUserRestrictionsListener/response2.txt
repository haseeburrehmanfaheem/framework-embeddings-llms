To determine the access control level for the `addUserRestrictionsListener` method, we must analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs along with their assigned access control levels.

The `addUserRestrictionsListener` method involves adding a listener to the `mUserRestrictionsListeners` list. This operation does not directly interact with sensitive user data or perform actions that could potentially harm the system or user privacy. However, the addition of a listener could imply the ability to monitor or react to changes in user restrictions, which might be considered sensitive in certain contexts.

The similar APIs provided are `grantDefaultPermissionsToCarrierServiceApp` and `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods deal with granting or revoking permissions, which directly impacts the security and privacy of the system and its users. Their operations are more sensitive than simply adding a listener.

Given that `addUserRestrictionsListener` does not directly manipulate permissions or sensitive data but rather adds a mechanism to observe changes, it seems less critical in terms of access control compared to the similar APIs provided. However, because it still interacts with system-level services and could potentially influence or monitor system behavior related to user restrictions, assigning it a level of `NONE` might be too permissive.

Between `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, and `SYS_OR_SIG`, considering that this method does not directly handle sensitive data or dangerous operations like the similar APIs (which deal with permission management), but still is involved in system-level service interactions, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects a balance between allowing the operation for legitimate uses while still acknowledging its potential implications on system behavior and user privacy.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality and comparing it with the provided similar APIs, the final access control level for the `addUserRestrictionsListener` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
