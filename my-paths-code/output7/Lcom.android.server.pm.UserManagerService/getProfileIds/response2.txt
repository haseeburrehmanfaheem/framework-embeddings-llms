To determine the access control level for the `getProfileIds` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `getProfileIds` method appears to be retrieving a list of profile IDs related to a given user ID (`p1`) and a boolean flag (`p2`). The method interacts with the `UserManagerService` class and checks various conditions, such as whether the user is enabled, not being removed, and matches certain criteria.

The sink code provided suggests that the method returns an array of integers representing the profile IDs.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. `getProfiles(IZ)Ljava/util/List;` with a similarity score of 0.8760411739349365:
	* This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
	* The code snippet shows that it calls `UserManagerService.getProfileIdsLU(p1, 0, p2)`, which is similar to the `getProfileIds` method.
2. `getRemainingCreatableProfileCount(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with a similarity score of 0.8153582811355591:
	* This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
	* The code snippet shows that it calls `UserManagerService.getProfileIdsLU(p2, p1, 0)`, which is similar to the `getProfileIds` method.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions. Given the similarities in code and functionality between these APIs and the `getProfileIds` method, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getProfileIds` method also requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getProfileIds` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
