To determine the access control level for the `removeUser` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeUser` method interacts with sensitive data and operations, such as:

* Accessing user information (`this.mUsers.get(p1)`)
* Updating user restrictions (`this.mCachedEffectiveUserRestrictions.updateRestrictions(p1, v25)`)
* Removing a user from the system (`this.mAppOpsService.removeUser(p1)`)

The similar APIs provided also interact with sensitive data and operations:

* `setUserRestriction` updates user restrictions and requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
* `removeUserWhenPossible` removes a user from the system and also requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Given the similarities in functionality and sensitivity, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeUser` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the comparison with similar APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `removeUser` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the `removeUser` method requires a system or signature-level permission to execute, ensuring that only authorized components can remove users from the system.
