To determine the access control level for the `getUserName` API, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**: The provided code paths for `getUserName` involve checking user IDs, retrieving user information, and handling guest user types. These operations are sensitive as they deal with user data and system-level information.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets provided indicate interactions with user management services, such as getting the user ID, checking if a user is a guest, and creating new `UserInfo` objects. These actions suggest that the API interacts with potentially sensitive user data and system settings.

3. **Similar APIs Comparison**:
   - The similar APIs (`getUserInfo(I)Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo;`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these APIs, which are similar in functionality to `getUserName`, require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. This is because they deal with user information and system settings, which are sensitive and should be protected against unauthorized access.

Given the analysis above, we can infer that the `getUserName` API likely deals with sensitive user data and interacts with system-level services in a manner similar to the provided similar APIs. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getUserName` API should have an access control level that protects against unauthorized access to user data and ensures system integrity.

Considering the options:
- **NONE**: This level suggests no protection is needed, which seems inappropriate given the sensitive nature of user data.
- **NORMAL**: While this could be a consideration for less sensitive operations, the interaction with user IDs and potential system settings suggests a need for higher protection.
- **DANGEROUS**: This level indicates significant risk if misused, aligning with the sensitivity of accessing and manipulating user information.
- **SYS_OR_SIG**: This level is typically required for operations that involve system-level functionality or sensitive data, similar to what `getUserName` seems to interact with.

Given the similarities in code paths, sink interactions, and the access control levels of similar APIs (`SYS_OR_SIG`), it's logical to conclude that `getUserName` should also be classified under a similar level of access control to protect user data and system integrity.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
