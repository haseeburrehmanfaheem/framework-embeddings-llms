To assign an access control level to the `getSeedAccountType` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with similar logic, checking if a user exists and handling removals.
2. **Sink Code**: Interactions are primarily with `this.mUsers.get(p1)` and `this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1)`, which suggest access to user data and removal status.
3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getSeedAccountName(I)Ljava/lang/String;**: Has a high similarity score (1.0000001192092896) with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It involves getting user data, similar to the sink code in `getSeedAccountType`.
   - **isUserOfType(ILjava/lang/String;)Z**: Also has a high similarity score (0.993161141872406) and is classified as SYS_OR_SIG. This method checks user types, which might involve accessing sensitive user information.

Given these points:

- The method interacts with user data through `this.mUsers.get(p1)` and checks removal status via `this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1)`.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG due to their interaction with potentially sensitive user information.
- The logic in `getSeedAccountType` suggests it handles or provides access to specific types of user data, which could be considered sensitive.

Based on these considerations and the fact that both highly similar methods are classified as SYS_OR_SIG, it is reasonable to conclude that `getSeedAccountType` should also have a similar access control level due to its interaction with potentially sensitive user information.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
