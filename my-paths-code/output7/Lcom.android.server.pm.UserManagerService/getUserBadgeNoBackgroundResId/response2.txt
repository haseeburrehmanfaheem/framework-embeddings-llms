To determine the access control level for the `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method involves fetching user information and checking if a badge exists for the specified user type. It then returns the resource ID of the badge without a background. This operation seems to involve internal logic related to user management and badges, which might require some level of access control.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `UserTypeDetails` and `UserInfo`, focusing on retrieving badge information. These operations suggest that the method is dealing with sensitive or specific data that could be subject to restrictions based on the user's identity or the application's permissions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getUserIconBadgeResId(I)I`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to fetching badge resource IDs, whether for icons or other types of badges, are considered sensitive enough to require either system-level permissions or signature-level permissions. The high similarity scores (0.9550002813339233 and 0.9542304873466492) indicate that these APIs perform closely related functions to `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId`, likely dealing with similar security considerations.

Given the above analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` should have a similar access control level as the provided similar APIs, considering its functionality and the nature of data it handles. Thus, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems appropriate due to the method's involvement with potentially sensitive user information and badge details.

**Final Access Control Level:**
