To determine the access control level for the `isUserRunning` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `isUserRunning` method checks if a user with a given ID (`p1`) is running. It interacts with `UserManagerService$WatchedUserStates` and uses methods like `indexOfKey` and `get` to retrieve information about the user state.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets involve checking the user's running state directly through `this.mLocalService.isUserRunning(p1)` and accessing user states via `v4.get(p1, -1)` and `this.states.indexOfKey(p1)`. These operations are related to user management and state retrieval.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(I)Z**: This API has a similarity score of 1.000000238418579 with `isUserRunning`, indicating they are very similar in functionality or implementation. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically applies to methods that require system or signature-level permissions, often because they deal with sensitive operations or data.
   - **finishSession(I)V**: With a lower similarity score of 0.8387488126754761, this API still shares some characteristics with `isUserRunning` but is less similar. Its access control level is `NONE`, indicating it does not require special permissions to execute.

Given the above analysis:

- The high similarity between `isUserRunning` and `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(I)Z` suggests that `isUserRunning` might also deal with sensitive user state information, potentially requiring restricted access.
- The operations within `isUserRunning`, such as checking user states, are more aligned with system-level functionalities rather than public or normal functionalities.

Therefore, considering the similarity in functionality and the nature of the operation (dealing with user states), it's reasonable to conclude that `isUserRunning` should have an access control level similar to `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(I)Z`, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
