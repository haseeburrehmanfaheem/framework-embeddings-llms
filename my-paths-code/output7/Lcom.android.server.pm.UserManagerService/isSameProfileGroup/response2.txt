To assign an access control level to the `isSameProfileGroup` method, we should consider its similarity to other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are:

1. `isUserOfType(ILjava/lang/String;)Z` with a similarity score of 0.930557370185852 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API uses `UserInfo v3 = UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1);`, which suggests it deals with user information and requires a significant level of access control.

2. `getProfileParent(I)Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo;` with a similarity score of 0.9211804866790771 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also uses `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` and `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(UserInfo.profileGroupId)`, indicating it handles sensitive user profile information.

The `isSameProfileGroup` method itself interacts with sinks related to user management, as indicated by the use of `UserInfo` objects and checks against `UserInfo.profileGroupId`. This suggests that it deals with sensitive user profile information, similar to the provided APIs.

Given the high similarity scores with APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the method's interaction with user profile information (a sensitive aspect of user management), it is reasonable to conclude that the `isSameProfileGroup` method should also have a strict access control level.

Therefore, based on the similarities in functionality and the need to protect user profile information, the final access control level for the `isSameProfileGroup` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This level ensures that the method is treated with the same level of security as other sensitive user management APIs, requiring either system or signature-level permissions to access, thus protecting user data effectively.
