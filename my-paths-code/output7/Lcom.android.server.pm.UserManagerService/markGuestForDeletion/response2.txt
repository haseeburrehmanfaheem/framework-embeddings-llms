To determine the access control level for the `markGuestForDeletion` API, we need to analyze its behavior, the sinks it interacts with, and compare these aspects with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Behavior Analysis**: The `markGuestForDeletion` method is designed to mark a guest user for deletion under certain conditions. It checks various restrictions and flags related to user management before proceeding with the deletion process. This includes checking if the "no_remove_user" restriction is in place, verifying the guest status of the user, and ensuring that the user ID is valid for removal.

2. **Sink Interaction**: The method interacts with sinks related to modifying user information, specifically setting `UserInfo.guestToRemove` to 1, updating `UserInfo.flags`, and writing user data using `writeUserLP`. These operations are critical as they alter system settings and user data.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar APIs provided (`removeUserWhenPossible(IZ)I`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods, which also deal with removing or modifying users, require either system-level permissions or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - The code snippets for these similar APIs show operations like removing a user unchecked and updating user flags, followed by writing the changes. These actions are comparable in sensitivity to those performed by `markGuestForDeletion`.

Given the above analysis:

- **Sensitivity of Operations**: Modifying user flags and marking users for deletion are sensitive operations that could potentially impact system security or user data privacy if not properly controlled.
- **Comparison with Known APIs**: The similar APIs (`removeUserWhenPossible(IZ)I`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they require significant permissions to prevent misuse.
- **Access Control Considerations**: For an API like `markGuestForDeletion`, which interacts with system-level user management functionality and modifies critical user settings, assigning a lower access control level (like `NONE` or `NORMAL`) could pose security risks. The operations involved are too sensitive for such levels.

**Conclusion**: Given the sensitivity of the operations performed by `markGuestForDeletion`, its interaction with critical system sinks, and the comparison with similar APIs that require high-level permissions, it's reasonable to conclude that this API should also have a stringent access control level to prevent unauthorized or malicious use.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" \}}$
