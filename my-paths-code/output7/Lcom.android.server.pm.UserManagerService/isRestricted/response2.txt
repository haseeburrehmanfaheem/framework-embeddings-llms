To assign an access control level to the `isRestricted` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: Both paths of the API have similar logic, checking if a user is restricted based on their ID and other conditions. The critical part involves retrieving a `UserInfo` object using `getUserInfoLU(p1)`, which is also present in the sink code.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `isUserNameSet(I)Z` has a high similarity score (0.9852237105369568) with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves getting `UserInfo` using `getUserInfoLU(p1)`, similar to the sink in `isRestricted`.
   - `isQuietModeEnabled(I)Z` has a slightly lower similarity score (0.9746832847595215) but is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It also retrieves `UserInfo` with `getUserInfoLU(p1)`.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Typically required for system or signature-level permissions, suggesting the API interacts with sensitive data or functionality that requires higher privilege levels.
   - `NONE`: Indicates no special access control is needed, implying the operation does not involve sensitive data or actions that could compromise security.

Given these points:

- The `isRestricted` method involves checking user restriction status, which may require accessing sensitive user information. 
- Both similar APIs (`isUserNameSet` and `isQuietModeEnabled`) interact with `UserInfo` objects using `getUserInfoLU(p1)`, but they have different access control levels.
- `isUserNameSet` has a very high similarity score and is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting its operation might be considered more sensitive or system-level.

Considering the method's functionality and its interaction with user information (potentially sensitive), along with the similarities to other APIs, especially `isUserNameSet` which has a high similarity score and a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it seems reasonable that `isRestricted` would also require a similar level of access control due to its potential to interact with or reveal sensitive user data.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
