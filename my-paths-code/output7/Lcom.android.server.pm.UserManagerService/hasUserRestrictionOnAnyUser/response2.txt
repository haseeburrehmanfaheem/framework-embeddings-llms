To assign an access control level to the `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippet for `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` is complex and involves multiple conditional statements. However, the key aspects that determine its access control level are:

1. It checks if a specific user restriction is present using `this.USER_RESTRICTIONS.contains(p1)`.
2. It interacts with the package manager to get packages for a given UID and checks application information.
3. It merges and updates user restrictions based on various conditions.

The sink code provided involves getting the calling UID, packages for that UID, cloning and merging bundles related to user restrictions, and checking the validity of restrictions.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- `hasBaseUserRestriction` checks if a base user restriction is valid and gets its value from `mBaseUserRestrictions`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- `hasUserRestriction` checks if a user restriction is valid for a given user ID and retrieves effective user restrictions. Its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs deal with checking the validity or state of user restrictions, which implies they are handling sensitive information related to user policies and permissions.

Given that `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` involves complex logic related to user restrictions, including checks for specific conditions and updates to restriction states, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also handles sensitive information. The interaction with package managers, UIDs, and the merging of restriction bundles further supports this conclusion, as these operations could potentially impact system security or user data privacy.

Therefore, considering the complexity of its operations and the comparison with similar APIs, the `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` method should be assigned an access control level that reflects its potential to handle sensitive information or affect system security.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
