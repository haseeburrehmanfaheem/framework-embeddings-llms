To determine the access control level for the `startActivityAsUserByIntent` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `startActivityAsUserByIntent` method involves starting an activity as a specific user, indicated by the presence of `startActivityAsUser` calls within its implementation. This suggests interaction with system-level functionality related to activity management and user profiles.

2. **Analyzing Sinks**: The sink code provided shows interactions with `ActivityTaskManagerInternal`, which is responsible for managing activities, and `DevicePolicyEventLogger`, which logs events related to device policy. These interactions imply that the method has some level of system access or influence over how activities are started across different user profiles.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - The `getTargetUserProfiles` API, with an access control level of `NONE`, suggests operations related to retrieving information about target user profiles. Its similarity score is high (0.874132513999939), indicating a close relationship in functionality or implementation details.
   - The `resetInteractAcrossProfilesAppOps` API, also with an access control level of `NONE`, involves resetting app operations across profiles. This has a slightly lower but still significant similarity score (0.8398898839950562).

4. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically assigned to methods that do not pose significant security risks or require special permissions.
   - `NORMAL`: Methods that might need some level of access control, possibly related to user data or less sensitive operations.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Assigned to methods that deal with sensitive data or operations requiring explicit user consent, such as location access, contacts, etc.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Methods requiring system or signature-level permissions, indicating high-risk or privileged operations.

Given the method's involvement in starting activities across different user profiles and its interactions with system components like `ActivityTaskManagerInternal` and logging mechanisms, it suggests a need for more than basic access control. However, the similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, coupled with the nature of the operations (starting activities and logging), does not necessarily imply the highest level of risk or sensitivity typically associated with `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` levels.

Considering these points, the method seems to be more aligned with system-level functionality that is somewhat restricted but does not deal directly with highly sensitive user data. Therefore, a moderate access control level might be appropriate, considering its impact on system operations and potential security implications.

However, since the similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`, and without explicit indicators of high-risk operations (like direct manipulation of sensitive user data, financial transactions, etc.), it's reasonable to consider that this method, while important for system functionality, might not necessitate the highest levels of access control.

Thus, based on the information and analysis provided:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice reflects a balance between recognizing the method's system-level interactions and the lack of clear indicators that it deals with highly sensitive data or operations requiring explicit user consent or the highest levels of permission.
