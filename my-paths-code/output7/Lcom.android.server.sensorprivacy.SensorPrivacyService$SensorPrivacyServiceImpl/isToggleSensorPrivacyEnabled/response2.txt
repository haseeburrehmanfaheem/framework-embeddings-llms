To assign an access control level to the `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` checks the state of sensor privacy based on the parameters `p1`, `p2`, and the current user (`mCurrentUser`). It uses the `mSensorPrivacyStateController` to get the `SensorState` for the given parameters and then checks if the state is enabled.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets provided show how the method interacts with sensor privacy states, specifically checking if a sensor is enabled based on its state.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled(I)Z**: This API has a high similarity score and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It checks the state of multiple sensors (with IDs 1 and 2) for sensor privacy enabled status.
   - **isSensorPrivacyEnabled()Z**: Also with a high similarity score, this API is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control. It returns a boolean indicating whether all sensor states are enabled.

Given these points:
- The method interacts with sensitive information regarding sensor privacy states.
- Similar APIs that also interact with sensor privacy settings have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to protect the sensitive nature of the data they handle.
- The semantics of `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` align closely with these similar APIs in terms of handling sensor privacy states.

Based on this analysis, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` seems appropriate. This is because the method handles sensitive information (sensor privacy settings) that should be protected from unauthorized access, aligning with the protection level afforded by `SYS_OR_SIG`.
