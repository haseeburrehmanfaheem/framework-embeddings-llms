To determine the access control level for the `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet**: The method checks the state of sensor privacy for two types of sensors (identified by the parameters 1 and 2) using the `mSensorPrivacyStateController.getState` method and then returns a boolean value based on whether these states are enabled or not.

2. **Sink Code**: It involves getting the current user, retrieving sensor states using `mSensorPrivacyStateController.getState`, checking if these states are enabled, and interacting with `SensorPrivacyService`. This suggests interaction with sensitive data related to sensor privacy settings.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `setToggleSensorPrivacy(IIIZ)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method can change the toggle sensor privacy setting but first checks if such a change is allowed using `canChangeToggleSensorPrivacy`.
   - `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled(II)Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves and returns the state of sensor privacy for a given type, similar to parts of the logic in `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled`.

Given these points:

- The method is related to checking sensor privacy states, which could involve sensitive information.
- The similar APIs (`setToggleSensorPrivacy` and `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled`) are both assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level access due to their interaction with potentially sensitive settings or data.
- The logic of `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` does not directly modify settings but rather retrieves states, which is more aligned with the read-only nature of `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled`.

However, considering it deals with sensor privacy, which could be considered sensitive, and given that similar methods (`setToggleSensorPrivacy` and `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled`) are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` should also have a restricted access level to protect user data and system integrity.

Therefore, the final access control level for `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This choice reflects the method's interaction with potentially sensitive sensor privacy settings and aligns with the access controls applied to similar methods within the API set.
