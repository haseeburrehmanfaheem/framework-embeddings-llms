To determine the access control level for the `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - Two similar APIs are mentioned, both with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs interact with sensor privacy listeners and handle death recipients in a manner that suggests they require system or signature-level permissions to ensure secure operation.

2. **Code Snippets for Similar APIs**:
   - The code snippets for the similar APIs show registration of listeners (`boolean v3 = this.mListeners.register(p1);`) and handling of death recipients (`SensorPrivacyService$SensorPrivacyHandler.addDeathRecipient(p1);` or creating a new `SensorPrivacyService$DeathRecipient` and updating `mDeathRecipients`). These operations imply that the API is dealing with sensitive system-level functionalities, such as managing sensor privacy, which typically requires elevated permissions.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code provided for `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` involves registering a listener (`boolean v3 = this.mToggleSensorListeners.register(p1);`), checking and updating death recipients (`Object v5 = this.mDeathRecipients.get(p1);` followed by updates to `mDeathRecipients`), and creating a new `SensorPrivacyService$DeathRecipient`. These operations are similar in nature to the ones found in the provided similar APIs, indicating that `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` is also dealing with system-level sensor privacy management.

4. **Depth and Paths**:
   - The API has two paths with depth 2, both involving listener registration and death recipient management. This complexity suggests that the method's functionality is not trivial and involves significant system interaction.

Given these observations:

- The similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions.
- The operations performed by `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` (listener registration, death recipient management) are akin to those in the similar APIs, suggesting it deals with sensitive, system-level functionalities.

**Conclusion**: Based on the similarity in functionality and operations with other APIs that have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, and considering the method's involvement in system-level sensor privacy management, the most appropriate access control level for `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
