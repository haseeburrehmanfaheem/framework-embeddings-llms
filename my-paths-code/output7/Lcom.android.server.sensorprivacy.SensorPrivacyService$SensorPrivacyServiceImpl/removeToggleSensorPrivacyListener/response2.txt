To determine the access control level for the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method involve unregistering a listener (`ISensorPrivacyListener`) from `mToggleSensorListeners`. 
   - If the listener is not found in `mToggleSensorListeners`, it checks for the presence of the listener in `mDeathRecipients`. Depending on the path, it either removes the listener and destroys an associated object (Path 2) or updates a counter associated with the listener (Path 3).
   - The logic involves internal management of listeners and does not directly interact with external resources that could pose security risks.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets provided show conditional checks for null (`p1 == 0`) followed by attempts to unregister or remove death recipients. This aligns with the method's purpose of removing a listener.
   - One of the sinks directly calls `SensorPrivacyService$SensorPrivacyHandler.removeDeathRecipient(p1)`, which is a critical operation related to sensor privacy, suggesting that the method deals with sensitive functionality.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It registers a listener and adds a death recipient, which is essentially the opposite operation of removing a listener.
   - Another similar API, `removeSensorPrivacyListener`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It unregisters a sensor privacy listener and removes a death recipient, closely aligning with the operations performed by `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener`.
   - Both similar APIs deal with sensor privacy listeners and have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that these operations are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permission.

Given the above analysis:
- The method's internal logic and interactions suggest it deals with sensitive listener management related to sensor privacy.
- The presence of sink code that directly interacts with death recipients and the method's similarity to other `SYS_OR_SIG` APIs indicate a need for restricted access.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of sensor privacy operations and the method's alignment with similar APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
