To determine the access control level for the `showToolbar` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `showToolbar` method involves interaction with services (`AbstractPerUserSystemService`, `RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService`) and callbacks (`ISelectionToolbarCallback`).
   - It checks for the existence of a service for a given user and, if not found, attempts to create or utilize a remote service.
   - The method does not explicitly perform operations that are typically classified as dangerous (e.g., accessing sensitive data, modifying system settings directly).

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code points involve the retrieval of services (`AbstractPerUserSystemService`) and interaction with `RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService`.
   - These interactions do not inherently imply a need for elevated permissions or access control beyond what is typically required for normal application operation.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`dismissToolbar` and `hideToolbar`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - The similarity in code structure (retrieving services, interacting with callbacks) and functionality (showing, hiding, dismissing toolbars) suggests that these methods operate within a comparable security context.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the nature of the operations performed by `showToolbar` and its similarities to other APIs classified as `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that this method does not require elevated access control.
   - The absence of direct manipulation of sensitive data or system settings further supports this conclusion.

Based on the analysis, the final access control level for the `showToolbar` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This determination reflects the method's operational characteristics and its alignment with similar APIs that have been classified as requiring no special access control.
