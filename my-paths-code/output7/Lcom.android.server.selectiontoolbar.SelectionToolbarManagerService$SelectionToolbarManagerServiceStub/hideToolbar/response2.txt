To determine the access control level for the `hideToolbar` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `hideToolbar` method interacts with system services and remote services related to selection toolbar management. It checks for the existence of certain services and attempts to hide or dismiss the toolbar based on conditions such as the availability of a remote service.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with `AbstractPerUserSystemService` and `RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService`. These interactions are related to getting services for specific users, ensuring remote services are available, and calling methods like `onHide` or `hideToolbar` on these services.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`dismissToolbar(JI)V`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - Their code snippets show interactions with `AbstractPerUserSystemService` to dismiss the toolbar, either directly through a service instance or via a remote service.
   - The similarity scores are high (0.9648104310035706 and 0.9611666202545166), indicating that these APIs share significant functionality and structure with the `hideToolbar` method.

Given this analysis:

- **Interactions with System Services**: The method interacts with system-level services, but similar APIs with high similarity scores have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
- **Semantics of Similar APIs**: The semantics of dismissing or hiding a toolbar seem to be uniformly treated as not requiring elevated permissions in the provided examples.
- **Access Control Choices**:
  - `NONE`: Indicates no special access control is required, which aligns with the similar APIs provided.
  - `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, and `SYS_OR_SIG` imply varying levels of restriction or system-level access that do not seem to match the treatment of similar toolbar management methods.

Based on the high similarity scores with other APIs assigned an access control level of `NONE` and considering the nature of the interactions (which do not appear to involve sensitive data or dangerous operations as defined by Android's permission model), it is reasonable to conclude that the `hideToolbar` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

**Final Access Control Level:**
