Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that contribute to a sink in this API, and given that it does not follow any of the positive rules for identifying sinks but rather represents an edge case where the API essentially does nothing, we have to relax our analysis.

However, considering the instruction provided:

```java
public void clearGrantedUriPermissions(String p1, int p2){
    return;
}
```

The entire method body is essentially empty and returns immediately without performing any operations that could be considered as contributing to a sink. Yet, for completeness in following the instructions given:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public void clearGrantedUriPermissions(String p1, int p2){",
        "return;"
    ]
]
}
```

This representation includes all instructions of the method due to its simplicity and lack of any identifiable sinks based on the provided positive rules. It is a single set because there's no separation in logic or data flow within this minimalistic API implementation.
