To determine the access control level for the `clearGrantedUriPermissions` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**: Two similar APIs are mentioned, both with a high similarity score.
   - `removePermission(Ljava/lang/String;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Semantics and Functionality**: The names and parameters of these methods suggest they are involved in managing permissions or Uri permissions, which is a critical aspect of Android's security model. The method `clearGrantedUriPermissions` itself implies removing or clearing previously granted permissions for specific Uris, which directly impacts the security and privacy settings of an application.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose any security risk.
   - `NORMAL`: Used for methods that require normal permission checks but are not dangerous.
   - `DANGEROUS`: For methods that can potentially harm the user, such as accessing sensitive data or performing actions that have significant consequences without direct user consent.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-level operations or those requiring a signature level permission, which is more restrictive and typically used for APIs that deal with low-level system functionality or critical security settings.

Given that both similar APIs (`removePermission` and `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that these operations are considered to be at a system or signature level due to their impact on permission management. The method `clearGrantedUriPermissions`, by its nature, seems to fit into this category as well because it involves altering the state of granted permissions, which is a sensitive operation.

Therefore, considering the semantics and the access control levels of the similar APIs provided, the most appropriate access control level for `clearGrantedUriPermissions` would also be `SYS_OR_SIG`, reflecting its role in managing Uri permissions at a potentially system or signature level.
