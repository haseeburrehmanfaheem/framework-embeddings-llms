To determine the access control level for the `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method retrieves a list of whitelisted rule providers from the device's resources and filters them based on whether they are system apps. It uses the `PackageManager` to get package info and checks if the application is a system app.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves getting string arrays, iterating over lists, checking if an app is a system app using `AppIntegrityManagerServiceImpl.isSystemApp(v9)`, and adding apps to a list based on certain conditions. It also interacts with `PackageManager` to get package info.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **fixupAppDir**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7727 with `getWhitelistedRuleProviders`. Its access control level is `NONE`, indicating it doesn't require special permissions or system-level access. It involves fixing up an app directory based on the package name and UID.
   - **isChangeEnabledByUid**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7647 with `getWhitelistedRuleProviders`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions to check if a change is enabled for a specific UID.

Given these analyses, the key factors influencing the access control level are:
- The method's interaction with system resources (e.g., getting package info, checking if an app is a system app).
- The requirement for system-level permissions to perform these operations.

**Decision**: 
The `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method interacts with system resources and checks if apps are system apps, which suggests it requires some level of access control. However, unlike `isChangeEnabledByUid`, it doesn't directly imply the need for signature or system-level permissions solely based on its operations (retrieving a list of whitelisted providers). The operation is more about filtering based on system app status rather than performing actions that typically require high-level permissions.

Considering these factors and comparing with the provided APIs, `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` seems to lean towards requiring some access control but not necessarily at the `SYS_OR_SIG` level. Its operations are closer to those that don't necessarily need high-level permissions but do involve system resources in a way that's somewhat sensitive.

Therefore, given the choices and considering it doesn't perfectly align with the `NONE` level due to its interaction with system apps and resources, nor does it clearly require `SYS_OR_SIG` access for its primary function, the most fitting choice seems to be `NORMAL`. This reflects its need for some form of access control without necessitating the highest levels of permission.
