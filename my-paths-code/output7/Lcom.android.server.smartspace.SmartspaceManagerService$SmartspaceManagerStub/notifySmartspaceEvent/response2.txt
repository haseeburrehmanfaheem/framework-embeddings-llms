To determine the access control level for the `notifySmartspaceEvent` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - The `registerSmartspaceUpdates` and `unregisterSmartspaceUpdates` methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to smartspace events are considered sensitive or system-internal, requiring either system-level privileges (`SYS`) or signature verification (`SIG`) for access.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The code snippet provided for `notifySmartspaceEvent` involves creating a lambda expression (`SmartspaceManagerService$SmartspaceManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda2`) and then executing it within the context of the smartspace service, using `v1.accept(v19)`.
   - It checks if the caller is temporary or not and performs actions based on this check. If the caller is not temporary (or under certain conditions), it proceeds with notifying the smartspace event.
   - The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and checking `isCallerRecents` suggests that the method is concerned about the identity and type of the calling process, indicating a need to control access based on the caller's privileges or status.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves creating an instance of `SmartspaceManagerService$SmartspaceManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda2` with `p1` and `p2` as parameters, followed by calling `accept` on this instance.
   - This pattern is similar to what's observed in the similar APIs (`registerSmartspaceUpdates` and `unregisterSmartspaceUpdates`), reinforcing the notion that these operations are part of a sensitive or system-internal functionality set.

Given these observations:
- The method is related to smartspace events, which seems to be a system-level or sensitive functionality based on similar APIs.
- It involves checks for the caller's identity and type, suggesting access control is necessary.
- The pattern of execution (using lambda expressions and `accept` method) matches that of other methods with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of similar APIs and the code snippet provided, it appears that `notifySmartspaceEvent` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it operates within a sensitive or system-internal context similar to its counterparts.
