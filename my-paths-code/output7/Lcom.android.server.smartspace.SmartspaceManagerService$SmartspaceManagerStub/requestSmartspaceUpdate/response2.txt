To assign an access control level to the `requestSmartspaceUpdate` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs.

The `requestSmartspaceUpdate` method creates a new instance of `SmartspaceManagerService$SmartspaceManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda4` and calls its `accept` method. This is similar to the code snippets of the two similar APIs: `destroySmartspaceSession` and `registerSmartspaceUpdates`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The similarity in code structure and the presence of similar lambda expressions suggest that `requestSmartspaceUpdate` likely requires a similar level of access control. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level is typically assigned to system-only or signature-protected APIs, which are not accessible to normal applications.

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `requestSmartspaceUpdate` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
