To determine the access control level for the `removeListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and the provided similar APIs along with their access control levels.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `removeListener` method takes an `IPacProxyInstalledListener` object as a parameter and attempts to unregister it from `this.mCallbacks`. The operation is straightforward and does not directly interact with sensitive data or perform any dangerous operations that could impact the system's security or privacy.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code focuses on the line where the actual unregistration happens, which is `boolean v3 = this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1);`. This line indicates that the method's primary action is removing a callback listener, which in itself does not imply a risky operation.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **unregisterCallback(Landroid/debug/IAdbCallback;)V**: This API has a very high similarity score with `removeListener` and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. The code snippet provided for this API also performs an unregistration action, which aligns with the behavior of `removeListener`.
   - **unregisterShortcutChangeCallback(Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/content/pm/IShortcutChangeCallback;)V**: With a slightly lower but still high similarity score, this API also has an access control level of `NONE`. Its code involves un-registering a callback related to shortcut changes, which is conceptually similar to removing a listener in the context of `removeListener`.

Given these points, it's clear that both similar APIs perform actions that are analogous to the `removeListener` method and have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`. Since the operations involved do not pose significant risks or handle sensitive information directly, it is reasonable to infer that the `removeListener` method should also be assigned a similar access control level.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and the provided similar APIs with their access control levels, the most appropriate access control level for the `removeListener` API is `NONE`.
