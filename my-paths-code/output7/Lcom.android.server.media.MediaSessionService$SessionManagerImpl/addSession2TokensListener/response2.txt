Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `addSession2TokensListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `addSession2TokensListener` method is used to add a listener for session 2 tokens. The method checks if the provided listener is not null and then proceeds to add it to the list of listeners. The method also checks if the listener is already present in the list before adding it.

The similar APIs, `removeSession2TokensListener`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods are used to remove a listener for session 2 tokens. The methods check if the provided listener is present in the list and then remove it.

After analyzing the code snippets and the semantics of the APIs, I notice that:

1. The `addSession2TokensListener` method does not perform any sensitive operations that require elevated permissions.
2. The method only adds a listener to a list, which is a relatively benign operation.
3. The similar APIs, `removeSession2TokensListener`, have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require special permissions.

Based on these observations, I conclude that the `addSession2TokensListener` method does not require any special permissions or access control levels beyond the default.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the method performs a relatively benign operation and does not interact with sensitive data or resources that would require elevated permissions. Additionally, the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that this level is sufficient for this type of operation.
