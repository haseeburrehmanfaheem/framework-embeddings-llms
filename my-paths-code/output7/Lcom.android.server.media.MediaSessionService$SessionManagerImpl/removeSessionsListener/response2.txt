Based on the provided information, we can see that the `removeSessionsListener` method has a similar structure and functionality to the `removeSession2TokensListener` methods. All of these methods are used to remove listeners from a list and unlink them from death.

The `removeSession2TokensListener` methods have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not pose a significant security risk.

The sink code for `removeSessionsListener` also shows that it is removing an element from a list and unlinking it from death, which is similar to the behavior of the `removeSession2TokensListener` methods.

Given this information, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `removeSessionsListener` method, as it does not appear to pose a significant security risk.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
