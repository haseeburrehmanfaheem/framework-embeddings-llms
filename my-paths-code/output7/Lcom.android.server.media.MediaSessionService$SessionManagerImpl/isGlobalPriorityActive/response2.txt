To determine the access control level for the `isGlobalPriorityActive` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `isGlobalPriorityActive` method checks if a global priority session is active. It involves checking the state of `mGlobalPrioritySession` and potentially calling another method (`isActive`) on this object to determine its activity status.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided shows that the outcome of `isGlobalPriorityActive` depends on the result of `isGlobalPriorityActiveLocked`, which suggests there's an internal check or lock mechanism in place to ensure thread safety or synchronization when determining if a global priority is active.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **`isHigherPriority` API**: This has a similarity score of 0.7512971758842468 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The method seems to compare the priorities of two `ResourceClientProfile` objects internally using `isHigherPriorityInternal`. Given its high similarity score, it suggests that priority checks might require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on resource allocation.
   - **`setSessionPolicies` API**: With a lower similarity score of 0.7342493534088135 and an access control level of `NONE`, this method sets session policies based on provided parameters without any visible checks that would necessitate higher access controls.

Given these points, the decision for assigning an access control level to `isGlobalPriorityActive` should consider:
- The nature of its operation (checking global priority status).
- The involvement of internal locking mechanisms for synchronization.
- The similarity with other APIs, especially those requiring system or signature-level permissions due to their impact on resource management.

Since `isGlobalPriorityActive` involves checking a state that could potentially affect how resources are prioritized within the system and given its similarity with an API that has been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to infer that this method might also require a certain level of restriction or permission to access. However, without direct manipulation of sensitive data or explicit calls to methods known to require high permissions in the provided snippet, the exact level can be debated.

Considering the above analysis and the fact that `isGlobalPriorityActive` seems to operate within a context that could influence system behavior (priority management), but lacks direct evidence of handling sensitive information or performing actions that would strictly necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, a cautious approach might lean towards assigning it an access control level that reflects its potential impact on system operations without overestimating its sensitivity.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API could be considered as follows:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice balances the method's operational context with the provided similarities and code insights, recognizing it operates within a potentially sensitive domain (priority management) but doesn't directly manipulate critical system resources or data that would necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` access.
