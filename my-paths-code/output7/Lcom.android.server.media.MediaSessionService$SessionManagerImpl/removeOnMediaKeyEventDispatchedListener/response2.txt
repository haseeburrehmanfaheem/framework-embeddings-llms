Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` method.

The method has two similar APIs:

1. `addOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener`: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It adds a listener to the `mOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListeners` map and links the listener to death using `linkToDeath`.
2. `addOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also adds a listener to a map and links the listener to death.

The `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` method removes a listener from the `mOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListeners` map and unlinks the listener from death using `unlinkToDeath`.

Considering the similarities between these APIs, we can infer that the access control level of `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` should be similar to `addOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener`, which is `NONE`. The reason is that both methods operate on the same map and perform complementary operations (adding and removing listeners).

The fact that `addOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener` has a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`) might be due to additional security requirements or restrictions specific to that API. However, based on the provided information, there is no indication that such restrictions apply to `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the access control level for the `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` method should be `NONE`.
