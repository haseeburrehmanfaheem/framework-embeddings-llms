To identify potential sinks in the provided code snippet, let's analyze it step by step.

The API is `onReceive`, which takes a `Context` and an `Intent` as parameters. Inside this method:

1. An object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` (which seems to be an inner class) is created with three parameters: `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`. The `p0` likely refers to the context of the current class or another relevant parameter not directly shown in this snippet, while `p2` and `p1` are the `Intent` and `Context` passed to `onReceive`, respectively.
2. The `start()` method is called on the newly created object `v1`.

Given these steps, we can identify potential sinks based on the provided rules:

- **Method invocation**: The creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its `start()` method call could be considered as part of a sink because it directly involves the input parameters (`p2` and `p1`) and likely uses them in some manner within the `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` class.
- **Object creation**: The new object creation with data flow from the API parameters also fits one of the positive rules.

The instructions that contribute to this sink are:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
        "v1.start();"
    ]
]
}
```

This JSON represents the coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink, with a clear data flow link between them. The output or usage of one instruction directly influences the input or creation of the next. Since there's no other instruction set provided in the context that could be considered as a separate sink without direct data propagation, this remains as the sole entry in the `Sinks` array.
