Based on the provided information, we can see that the `onReceive` method has two similar APIs with a similarity score of 1.0, and both of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. The code snippets for these similar APIs are identical to the code snippet for the `onReceive` method.

Given this information, it appears that the `onReceive` method is performing a similar operation to the other two APIs, which involves creating an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and starting it. Since both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that this operation does not require any special permissions or access controls.

Therefore, based on the similarity in code and access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `onReceive` method.

{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
