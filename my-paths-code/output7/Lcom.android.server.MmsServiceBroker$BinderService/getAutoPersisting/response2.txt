To determine the access control level for the `getAutoPersisting` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and similar APIs.

The provided code paths and sink code indicate that `getAutoPersisting` interacts with the MmsServiceBroker to retrieve a service and then calls the `getAutoPersisting` method on it. This interaction involves getting a service guarded by some form of authentication or permission check, which is a common pattern for protecting sensitive operations.

The similar APIs provided are both `setAutoPersisting` methods with high similarity scores (0.891449511051178 and 0.8671345114707947). These methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system-level permissions or a signature-level permission to execute. The fact that these similar APIs, which are closely related in functionality (setting auto-persisting versus getting its status), have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that the operation is considered sensitive and requires appropriate authorization.

Given this information:

- The method involves interaction with a service broker, which often implies some form of permission or authentication check.
- Similar APIs (`setAutoPersisting`) are classified as requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, indicating they are sensitive operations.
- The nature of getting auto-persisting status might not be as directly impactful as setting it but still deals with potentially sensitive service configurations.

Therefore, considering the patterns and the need for protecting such operations from unauthorized access, the `getAutoPersisting` method should also be classified under a similar or related access control level. However, since getting a status is generally less risky than setting a configuration (like in `setAutoPersisting`), but still deals with service-level information, it might not necessarily require system or signature-level permissions explicitly unless it directly accesses sensitive data without proper abstraction.

Given the provided choices and considering standard practices for protecting service interactions:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice reflects a balanced approach, acknowledging that while `getAutoPersisting` involves service interaction which might require some form of protection or permission check, it doesn't explicitly set or modify sensitive data like its similar counterpart `setAutoPersisting`. The access control could be considered `NORMAL` if the method's implementation and the service it interacts with do not directly handle highly sensitive information or actions that would necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` level protections. However, without explicit details on the sensitivity of the data handled by `getAutoPersisting`, this determination leans on the side of caution while recognizing the method's operational context.
