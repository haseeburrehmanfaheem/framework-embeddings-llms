To determine the access control level for the `addTextMessageDraft` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `addTextMessageDraft` method has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve getting an instance of `IMms` using `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` and then calling the `addTextMessageDraft` method on that instance. The sink code also shows a similar pattern, where it gets an `IMms` instance and calls `addTextMessageDraft` on it.

The similar APIs provided, `addMultimediaMessageDraft`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also involve getting an `IMms` instance using `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` (or a similar method) and then calling the `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method on that instance.

Given the similarities in code pattern and the fact that all these methods seem to be interacting with the MMS service, it's reasonable to infer that the `addTextMessageDraft` method should have a similar access control level. The SYS_OR_SIG access control level suggests that the API is either system-internal or requires a signature permission to access, which aligns with the pattern of interacting with a brokered service like MmsServiceBroker.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity in code patterns and functionality with other APIs that have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, the final access control level for the `addTextMessageDraft` API should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
