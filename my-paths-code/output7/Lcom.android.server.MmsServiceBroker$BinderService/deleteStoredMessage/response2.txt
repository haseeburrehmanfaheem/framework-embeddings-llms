To determine the access control level for the `deleteStoredMessage` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The API has two paths with similar structures, both involving a call to `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` or accessing a service stub (`this.mServiceStubForFailure`) before calling `deleteStoredMessage` on the retrieved service object.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with an `IMms` service, specifically calling `deleteStoredMessage` and returning its result.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two instances of `updateStoredMessageStatus` are provided as similar APIs, both with a high similarity score to `deleteStoredMessage`. 
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code for these similar APIs also involves getting a service (`IMms`) and then calling a method on it, which is analogous to the behavior in `deleteStoredMessage`.

Given this information:

- **Similarity with Other APIs**: The high similarity scores with `updateStoredMessageStatus` APIs, which are both classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggest that `deleteStoredMessage` likely requires a similar level of access control. This is because these APIs seem to interact with system-level services in a guarded manner.

- **Service Interaction**: The interaction with `MmsServiceBroker` and the pattern of getting a service before performing an operation indicate that this API deals with sensitive operations, possibly requiring elevated permissions or specific signatures to execute.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to conclude that `deleteStoredMessage` should have a similar access control level to its highly similar counterparts, which are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`. This classification typically indicates that the API can only be called by system applications or applications signed with the platform key, reflecting its potential to interact with sensitive data or services.
