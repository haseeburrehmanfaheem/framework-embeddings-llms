Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method has two paths with depth 2, both of which interact with the `MmsServiceBroker` service to add a multimedia message draft. The sink code snippets also indicate that the method is using the `IMms` interface to perform the operation.

The similar APIs provided have high similarity scores (0.9612753987312317 and 0.9116268754005432) and are also related to adding message drafts. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to execute.

Given the similarities between the `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method and the provided APIs, it is likely that this method also requires a system or signature-level permission to interact with the `MmsServiceBroker` service and add a multimedia message draft.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
