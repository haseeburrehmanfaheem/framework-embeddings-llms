To determine the access control level for the `importTextMessage` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `importTextMessage` method has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve interacting with the `MmsServiceBroker` to get or connect a service (`IMms`) and then call the `importTextMessage` method on that service. The sink code provided also involves getting a service guarded by `MmsServiceBroker` and calling `importTextMessage` on it.

Given the similar APIs, specifically `importMultimediaMessage`, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that the `importTextMessage` method likely requires a similar level of access control. This is because both methods:

1. Interact with the `MmsServiceBroker` to obtain a service.
2. Perform operations related to importing messages (text or multimedia), which could potentially involve sensitive data or system-level functionalities.

The high similarity scores between `importTextMessage` and `importMultimediaMessage` (0.9519439935684204 and 0.9304014444351196) suggest that their functional behaviors and requirements are closely related. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for `importTextMessage` should be consistent with that of `importMultimediaMessage`, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

This conclusion is based on the assumption that operations involving the importation of messages into the system require either system-level permissions or signature-level access to ensure that only authorized and trusted applications can perform these sensitive operations.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the method's potential interaction with sensitive data and system services, necessitating a higher level of access control to maintain security and integrity.
