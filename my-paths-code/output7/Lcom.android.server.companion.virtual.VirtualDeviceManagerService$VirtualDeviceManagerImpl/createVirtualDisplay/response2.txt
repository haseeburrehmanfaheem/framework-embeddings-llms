To determine the access control level for the `createVirtualDisplay` method, we need to analyze its functionality, interactions with other components, and compare it with similar APIs provided.

The `createVirtualDisplay` method is involved in creating a virtual display, which includes operations such as:

1. Interacting with the `DevicePolicyManager` to check policies.
2. Creating a `GenericWindowPolicyController`.
3. Setting up input manager properties for the new display.
4. Acquiring a wake lock.

Given these interactions and operations, let's analyze the similar APIs provided:

1. **removeAccountAsUser**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with device policy management, specifically checking if a profile or device owner is active. The similarity score is 0.8532871007919312, indicating a high degree of similarity in terms of system-level operations and policy checks.

2. **addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener**: This API has an access control level of `NORMAL`. It involves setting up a listener for network policies within the context of Virtual Cellular Networks (VCN). The similarity score is 0.8284165859222412, showing a significant but slightly lower similarity compared to `removeAccountAsUser`.

Considering these points:

- **Interactions with System Services**: Both similar APIs interact closely with system services (`DevicePolicyManager` for `removeAccountAsUser`, and `VcnManagementService` for `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`). The `createVirtualDisplay` method also interacts with system services like `DevicePolicyManage`, `UserManage`, `PowerManage`, etc.
  
- **Policy Checks and System-Level Operations**: The operations involved in `createVirtualDisplay`, such as policy checks, creating displays, and acquiring wake locks, suggest a level of system integration similar to that of `removeAccountAsUser`.

Given these considerations, the access control level for `createVirtualDisplay` seems more aligned with `SYS_OR_SIG` due to its involvement in system-level operations, policy checks, and interactions with critical system services. While it shares some operational similarities with `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, its deeper integration with system policies and services leans towards requiring a higher access control level.

**Access Control Level Decision**: Given the analysis above, the most appropriate access control level for the `createVirtualDisplay` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects its need to interact with sensitive system components and policies, similar to the `removeAccountAsUser` API.
