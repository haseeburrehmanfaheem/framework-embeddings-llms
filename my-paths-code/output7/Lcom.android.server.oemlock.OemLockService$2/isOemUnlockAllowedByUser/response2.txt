To determine the access control level for the `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` checks if OEM unlock is allowed by the device. It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)` to manage the calling identity temporarily, which suggests it's dealing with a sensitive operation that requires careful handling of the caller's identity.
   - The actual check is performed by calling `v3.isOemUnlockAllowedByDevice()`, where `v3` is an instance of `OemLock`. This indicates the method is interacting with device-level settings related to OEM unlocking.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs provided, such as `setOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier(Z[B)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are involved in setting the OEM unlock allowance based on carrier preferences, which is a sensitive operation requiring system or signature-level permission.
   - The similarity in functionality (dealing with OEM unlock settings) and the use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v9)` to temporarily change the calling identity for performing these sensitive operations suggest that these methods are operating within a similar security context.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` is checking a device setting related to OEM unlocking, which is a sensitive operation, and considering the similarities with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to infer that this method also requires a similar level of access control.
   - However, since `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` is a getter method (it retrieves information rather than modifying it), it might not require the same level of permission as setter methods like `setOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier`. Yet, due to its interaction with sensitive device settings and the need to temporarily manage caller identity, assigning it a less restrictive access control than `SYS_OR_SIG` could potentially undermine security.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser`, considering both its functionality and the precedent set by similar APIs, would be `NORMAL`. This is because while it deals with sensitive information, it does so in a read-only capacity and does not modify device settings, which might not necessitate the highest level of access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`) but still requires more than `NONE` due to its nature.
