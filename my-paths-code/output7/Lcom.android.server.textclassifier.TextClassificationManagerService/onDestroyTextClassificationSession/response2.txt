Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `onDestroyTextClassificationSession` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onDestroyTextClassificationSession` method has a similarity score of 0.8959330320358276 with the `onGenerateLinks` API and 0.8891811370849609 with the `onSuggestConversationActions` API, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `onDestroyTextClassificationSession` method may also require a similar level of access control.

Upon examining the code snippet for `onDestroyTextClassificationSession`, I notice that it involves interactions with system-level components, such as `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` and `TextClassificationManagerService$UserState`. Additionally, the method creates instances of `SystemTextClassifierMetadata` and `TextClassificationManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda5`, which may require elevated permissions.

Given these observations, I conclude that the `onDestroyTextClassificationSession` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it appears to interact with system-level components and requires elevated permissions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
