Since there are no method invocations, field access or updates, object creation, or data flows that follow the positive rules, and considering this is a small API, we can relax the rules to consider all instructions as part of a sink.

Here's the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public void onConnectedStateChanged(int p1){",
        "return;"
    ]
]
}
```

However, considering this API does essentially nothing (it returns immediately without any processing), it might not be considered a significant sink. If we were to strictly follow the positive rules provided and ignore small APIs that don't contribute meaningful data flows or access sensitive information, this API would have no sinks according to those criteria. But given the instruction to provide analysis based on the given code and consider all instructions for small APIs, the above JSON represents a simplified interpretation of potential sink identification in this context.
