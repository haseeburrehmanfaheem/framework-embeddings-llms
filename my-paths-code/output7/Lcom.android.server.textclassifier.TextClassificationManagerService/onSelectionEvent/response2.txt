Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `onSelectionEvent` method.

The `onSelectionEvent` method has two paths with depth 2, and both paths involve creating a `TextClassificationManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3` object and handling requests using `handleRequest` or creating a `TextClassificationManagerService$PendingRequest` object. The sink code also involves getting the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()`.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs also involve handling requests and creating pending requests, similar to the `onSelectionEvent` method.

Given the similarities between the `onSelectionEvent` method and the similar APIs, it is likely that the `onSelectionEvent` method requires a similar level of access control. Therefore, based on the provided information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `onSelectionEvent` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
