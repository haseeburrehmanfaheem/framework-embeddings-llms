To determine the access control level for the `requestInstall` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `requestInstall` enforces a specific permission check at the beginning with `this.mPermissionHelper.enforceCallerHasPermission("android.permission.UPDATE_TIME_ZONE_RULES");`. This indicates that the method is protected by a specific permission, suggesting it performs operations that are sensitive or require certain privileges.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves creating `CheckToken` instances and executing a `RulesManagerService$InstallRunnable`. These operations seem to be related to installing timezone rules, which could potentially affect system behavior or data. However, the critical aspect here is the enforcement of the permission check before proceeding with these operations.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**: 
   - The similar API `requestUninstall` has an access control level of `NONE`, but it's crucial to note that despite the similarity in names and operations (installation vs. uninstallation), the presence of a permission check in `requestInstall` differentiates it from `requestUninstall`.
   - Both versions of `requestUninstall` provided do not show explicit permission checks like `requestInstall` does, which might explain their `NONE` access control level.

Given these points:

- The method `requestInstall` explicitly enforces a permission check for `"android.permission.UPDATE_TIME_ZONE_RULES"`, indicating it's designed to protect potentially sensitive or system-affecting operations.
- Despite similarities with `requestUninstall` APIs, the explicit permission enforcement in `requestInstall` suggests a higher level of access control is intended.

Considering the options:
- **NONE**: This seems inappropriate given the explicit permission check.
- **NORMAL**: This could be a reasonable choice since the method does enforce a specific permission, which is not indicative of the highest levels of system privilege or signature requirements but still implies some protection.
- **DANGEROUS**: While the operation might have implications for system or user data, the term "dangerous" typically refers to operations that can cause direct harm (e.g., making calls, sending SMS). Installing timezone rules, while important, doesn't directly fit into typical "dangerous" categories without more context on potential misuse.
- **SYS_OR_SIG**: This suggests a requirement for system or signature-level permissions, which might be too restrictive given the method only checks for `"android.permission.UPDATE_TIME_ZONE_RULES"`.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate access control level seems to be **NORMAL**, as it reflects the protection of the operation by a specific permission without implying the need for system or signature-level access.
