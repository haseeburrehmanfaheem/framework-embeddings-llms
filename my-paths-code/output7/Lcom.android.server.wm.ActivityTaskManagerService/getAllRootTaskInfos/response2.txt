To determine the access control level for the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets for `getAllRootTaskInfos` show variations in how it interacts with system resources, specifically through `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks`. However, all paths share a common trait: they involve iterating over root tasks within the window container and collecting information about them into an `ArrayList`, which is then returned.

The sink code provided also involves creating an `ArrayList` to store task information and using a lambda expression (`RootWindowContainer$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12`) to iterate over tasks with `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks`.

Given these details, let's consider the similar APIs:

1. **API Name: getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay(I)Ljava/util/List;**  
   - **Similarity Score:** Very high (approaching 1.0) in both cases.
   - **Access Control Level:** SYS_OR_SIG for both.

The high similarity score between `getAllRootTaskInfos` and `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay(I)Ljava/util/List;`, combined with their similar operations on system resources, suggests that the access control requirements are likely to be similar. The SYS_OR_SIG access control level typically indicates that the API can only be accessed by system or signature applications, reflecting its potential to impact system stability or security.

Given these considerations:

- **Operation Sensitivity:** The operation involves accessing and potentially manipulating task information at a system level.
- **Similarity with Other APIs:** High similarity with APIs that have been assigned SYS_OR_SIG access control.
- **Potential Impact:** Could affect system performance, stability, or even security if not properly controlled.

Therefore, considering the potential impact on system resources and the high degree of similarity with other APIs classified as SYS_OR_SIG, it's reasonable to conclude that `getAllRootTaskInfos` should also be assigned a similar access control level.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the principle of restricting sensitive operations to system or signature applications to maintain system integrity and security.
