To determine the access control level for the `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method, we should consider the semantics of the method, its interactions with other components, and the access control levels of similar APIs.

The `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method appears to be responsible for removing all visible recent tasks from the system. This operation involves interacting with task lists, user management services, and potentially affecting the state of running applications or tasks.

1. **Interaction with Sensitive Data/Operations**: The method interacts with task lists (`this.mTasks`) and user management services (`UserManagerService`), which could be considered sensitive operations as they involve managing and modifying the state of user tasks and potentially system-level information.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes([I)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also deals with task management, specifically removing root tasks in certain windowing modes, which suggests it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute.
   - `getAppTasks(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/List;` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It is involved in retrieving a list of application tasks for a given string (likely a package name), which implies access to sensitive information about running tasks.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: No special permission required. This seems unlikely given the method's interaction with system-level task management.
   - `NORMAL`: Permission that is granted to normal applications, without needing to be signed with the platform key or having specific system permissions.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Permissions that could potentially affect the user's privacy or the operation of other applications. While this might seem plausible due to the method's impact on task management, it doesn't directly imply access to sensitive user data or dangerous operations like sending SMS or making calls.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Requires either system-level permission (i.e., being a system application) or signature-level permission (i.e., being signed with the same certificate as the application that defined the permission). Given the method's role in task management and its similarity to other APIs requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access, this seems like the most appropriate level.

Considering these points, the `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method likely requires system or signature-level permissions due to its involvement in managing tasks at a potentially system-wide level. Therefore, the access control level for this API should be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with similar task management APIs that require elevated permissions.
