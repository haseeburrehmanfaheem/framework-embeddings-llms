To determine the access control level for the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method, we should analyze its code paths, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs along with their access control levels.

### Analysis of Code Paths:

1. **Path 1**: This path involves clearing the calling identity, iterating over children (if any), checking for activity types, and potentially removing root tasks based on those types.
2. **Path 2**: Similar to Path 1 but includes a boost in priority using `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster.boost()` before proceeding with the removal process.
3. **Path 3**: Also similar to Path 1 but includes resetting the priority booster after restoring the calling identity.

### Analysis of Sink Code:

The sink code snippets provided show interactions with root tasks, including removing them based on activity types and boosting thread priorities for locked sections or during operations involving task supervision.

### Comparison with Similar APIs:

- **moveTaskToRootTask(IIZ)V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9164218902587891) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves moving tasks to root tasks, which requires system or signature-level permissions due to its implications on task management.
  
- **finishVoiceTask(Landroid/service/voice/IVoiceInteractionSession;)V**: With a similarity score of 0.9097170829772949, this API is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It's involved in finishing voice tasks and does not seem to require elevated permissions for its operation.

### Access Control Decision:

Given the operations performed by `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes`, such as iterating over and removing root tasks based on activity types, and considering the boost and reset of thread priority, this method appears to manage system-level resources directly. The ability to remove root tasks could have significant implications for the system's state and security.

The similarity with `moveTaskToRootTask`, which is classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggests that `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` may also require a similar level of access control due to its potential impact on system resources and task management. However, since it directly involves removal based on activity types without explicit mention of requiring system or signature-level permissions in the provided context, careful consideration must be taken.

Given these factors and focusing strictly on the information provided:

- The method's interaction with system tasks and its ability to remove them suggests a need for a controlled access level.
- The comparison with similar APIs indicates that operations affecting task management at this level often require higher access control levels.

Therefore, considering the implications of removing root tasks and the comparison with similar APIs, especially `moveTaskToRootTask` which is classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it seems reasonable to conclude that `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` should have an access control level reflecting its potential system impact.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
