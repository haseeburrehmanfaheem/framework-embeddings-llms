Based on the provided code and similar APIs, I will analyze the access control level for the `startActivityAndWait` method.

The method `startActivityAndWait` has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve the following operations:

1. Getting the calling PID and UID using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`.
2. Handling incoming users using `this.mAmInternal.handleIncomingUser()`.
3. Creating an `ActivityStarter` object and setting various properties such as intent, reason, caller, calling package, and more.
4. Setting the user ID, profiler info, and wait result for the `ActivityStarter` object.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The `startActivities` API has a similarity score of 0.9199575781822205 and involves similar operations such as getting the calling PID and UID, handling incoming users, and starting activities using an `ActivityStartController`.

The `startVoiceActivity` API has a similarity score of 0.8706105351448059 and also involves getting the calling PID and UID, handling incoming users, and setting properties for an `ActivityStarter$Request` object.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the operations involved in `startActivityAndWait`, I conclude that the access control level for `startActivityAndWait` should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
