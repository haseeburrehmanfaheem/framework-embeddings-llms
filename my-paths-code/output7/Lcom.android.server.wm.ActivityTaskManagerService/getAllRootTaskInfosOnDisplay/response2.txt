To assign an access control level to the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method, we should consider the similarity in code structure and functionality with the provided similar APIs, as well as the nature of the operations being performed.

The `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method involves retrieving root task information based on a display identifier (`p1`). It clears the calling identity (using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`), which suggests it is handling sensitive operations that require careful management of process identities. This operation is then followed by the restoration of the calling identity (using `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)`), ensuring that the process's original identity is reinstated after the sensitive operation.

The method also interacts with `WindowContainer` and `RootWindowContainer`, classes that are integral to the management of windowing and tasking in Android, indicating its involvement in system-level operations. The use of `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster.boost()` and `.reset()` in some paths further indicates it is dealing with prioritization of thread execution, which is a system-level concern.

Given these points:

1. **Similarity to Other APIs**: The provided similar APIs (`getAllRootTaskInfos()Ljava/util/List;`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature permissions to execute. Their code structures show similarities with the method in question, especially in how they handle task information retrieval.

2. **System-Level Operations**: The involvement in clearing and restoring calling identities, along with interactions with critical window and task management classes, suggests that `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` is performing operations that are significant at the system level.

3. **Sensitive Data Access**: By retrieving root task information on a specific display, this method accesses data that could be considered sensitive or restricted, as it pertains to the system's internal state and organization of tasks.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` should have an access control level similar to its counterparts due to its involvement in system-level operations and potential access to sensitive information.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the method's need for elevated permissions to perform its functions safely and securely within the Android system.
