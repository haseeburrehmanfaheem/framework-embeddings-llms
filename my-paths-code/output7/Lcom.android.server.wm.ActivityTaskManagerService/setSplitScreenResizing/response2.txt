Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `setSplitScreenResizing` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setSplitScreenResizing` method interacts with the window manager and docked task divider controller, which are system-level components. The method also calls `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)`, indicating that it is performing operations that require system-level permissions.

The similar APIs, `setTaskResizeable(II)V` and `moveRootTaskToDisplay(II)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system-level or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs also interact with system-level components, such as the task supervisor and root window container.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `setSplitScreenResizing` method, it is likely that the `setSplitScreenResizing` method requires similar access control levels.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setSplitScreenResizing` method.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
