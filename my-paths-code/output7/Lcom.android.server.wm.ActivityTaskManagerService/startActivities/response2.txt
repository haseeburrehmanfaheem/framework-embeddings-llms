Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `startActivities` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `startActivities` method has a similarity score of 0.9199575781822205 with the `startActivityAndWait` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `startActivities` method may require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the `startActivities` method has a similarity score of 0.8862263560295105 with the `startActivityFromGameSession` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that the `startActivities` method may require a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

The sink code for the `startActivities` method includes calls to `Binder.getCallingPid()`, `Binder.getCallingUid()`, and `handleIncomingUser()`, which are similar to the calls made in the `startActivityAndWait` and `startActivityFromGameSession` APIs. This suggests that the `startActivities` method is also interacting with sensitive system components and requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and the sink code, I conclude that the `startActivities` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
