Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `updateLockTaskFeatures` method.

The method interacts with sensitive data, specifically the `mLockTaskFeatures` map, which stores lock task features for different users. The method updates this map based on the input parameters `p1` and `p2`.

The sink code provided shows that the method writes to the `mLockTaskFeatures` map, which is a sensitive operation.

Comparing this with the similar APIs provided:

* `updateLockTaskPackages(I[Ljava/lang/String;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permission to update lock task packages.
* The code for `updateLockTaskPackages` shows that it updates a map (`this.mLockTaskPackages.put(p1, p2);`) similar to the `updateLockTaskFeatures` method.

Given the similarities between the two methods and the sensitive nature of the operation (updating a map that stores lock task features), it is reasonable to conclude that the `updateLockTaskFeatures` method requires a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `updateLockTaskFeatures` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permission to update lock task features.
