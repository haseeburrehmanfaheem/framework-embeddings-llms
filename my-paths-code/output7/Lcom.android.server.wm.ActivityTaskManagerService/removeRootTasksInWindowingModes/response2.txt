To determine the access control level for the `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` method, we need to analyze its code snippets and compare them with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets for `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` show that it interacts with the `RootWindowContainer` and removes root tasks based on certain conditions. The method also uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`, which are commonly used to protect sensitive operations by clearing and restoring the calling identity.

The similar APIs provided, `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` and `setFocusedRootTask`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the `RootWindowContainer` and perform operations that require system or signature-level permissions.

Considering the similarities between these methods and the fact that they all interact with sensitive window management functionality, it is reasonable to conclude that `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippets and the comparison with similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
