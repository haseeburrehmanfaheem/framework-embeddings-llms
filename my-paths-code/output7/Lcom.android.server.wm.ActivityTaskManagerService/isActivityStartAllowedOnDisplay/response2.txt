To determine the access control level for the `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Method Code**: The method involves checking if an activity can be started on a specific display. It considers factors like the caller's UID, intent resolution, and display properties.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet is about resolving activity info for an intent and checking if an entity (e.g., an activity) can be placed on a display. This suggests interaction with sensitive system functionalities related to activity management and display handling.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `startActivityAsUserByIntent`: This API has a high similarity score and is labeled with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. It's involved in starting activities as a specific user, which includes verification that the activity can handle the intent and interaction with internal activity task management services.
   - `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList`: With a lower similarity score compared to `startActivityAsUserByIntent`, it has an `NONE` access control level. This method seems less directly related to the core functionality of `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay`, as it deals with querying services for TV interactive apps.

Given these points:

- The `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method is closely related to system internals, such as activity management and display handling.
- Its similarity with `startActivityAsUserByIntent`, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggests that it might require similar protection levels due to its interaction with sensitive system functionalities.
- The involvement of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` indicates that the method considers the identity of the caller, which is a common practice in Android's security model to enforce permissions or signature protections.

Based on this analysis, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems appropriate because the method interacts with system internals related to activity and display management, similar to `startActivityAsUserByIntent`. This ensures that only system or signature-protected applications can invoke this method, aligning with Android's security principles.
