To determine the access control level for the `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (path 1, path 2, path 3) with similar operations but slight variations in how they handle tasks and display content. All paths involve retrieving task information related to a specific display.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show how task information is retrieved and returned. This includes creating an `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo` object, filling it with task info, and returning it.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `getRootTaskInfo(II)Landroid/app/ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo;`, with high similarity scores (0.995457649230957 and 0.9889705181121826). Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code for these similar APIs involves getting the root task info directly from `RootWindowContainer` using the provided parameters (`p1`, `p2`) and returning the `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo`.

Given this information, we can infer that:
- The `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` method is closely related to retrieving task information for a specific display.
- The method's operations involve tasks that are typically managed by system-level components or require significant privileges (`SYS_OR_SIG` access control level in similar APIs).
- The variations in the code paths (e.g., including or excluding `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster.boost();`) do not seem to fundamentally alter the nature of the operation from a security perspective.

Considering these points and the high similarity scores with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` method should also have a similar access control level. This is because it deals with system-level task management information that likely requires either system or signature-level permissions to access securely.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code snippets, sink code, and similar APIs, the final access control level for the `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
