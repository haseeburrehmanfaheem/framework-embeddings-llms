To determine the access control level for the `removeTask` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeTask` method interacts with various system components, such as `RootWindowContainer`, `Task`, `LockTaskController`, and `ActivityTaskSupervisor`. It performs several actions, including:

1. Retrieving a task by ID using `RootWindowContainer.anyTaskForId`.
2. Removing activities from the task using `v5.removeActivities`.
3. Cleaning up the removed task using `ActivityTaskSupervisor.cleanUpRemovedTaskLocked`.
4. Clearing the locked task using `LockTaskController.clearLockedTask`.

The similar APIs provided, `moveTaskToFront` and `startSystemLockTaskMode`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with system components, such as `LockTaskController` and `RootWindowContainer`, and perform actions that require system-level permissions.

Comparing the code and functionality of `removeTask` with these similar APIs, we can see that it performs actions that are similar in nature and require similar system-level permissions. Therefore, based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeTask` method.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
