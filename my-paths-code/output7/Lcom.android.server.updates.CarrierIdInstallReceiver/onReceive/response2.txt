Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `onReceive` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onReceive` method has a similarity score of 1.0 with two other APIs, which indicates that they are identical in terms of their code structure and functionality. All three methods create an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and call its `start()` method.

Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that the functionality implemented by these methods does not pose a significant security risk or require special permissions to execute.

Therefore, considering the similarity in code and functionality, as well as the access control levels of the comparable APIs, the `onReceive` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
