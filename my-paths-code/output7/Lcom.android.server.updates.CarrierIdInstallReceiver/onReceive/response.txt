To identify potential sinks in this code snippet according to the provided rules and guidelines:

- **Method invoked**: The method `start()` is invoked on an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. This invocation has a naming similarity with the API name (`onReceive`), as both are part of handling or processing (receiving, starting). However, `start()` itself does not directly follow any positive rules without considering its context and potential implementation details. The creation and use of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, however, do have a direct data flow link with the API parameters (`p0`, `p2`, `p1`).

- **Field access/update**: There are no explicit field accesses or updates in this snippet that directly relate to the positive rules.

- **Object creation**: The object `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created with a direct data flow from the API parameters (`p0`, `p2`, `p1`). This follows one of the positive rules because it's created using the API's input parameters, which indicates that this object's behavior or state could be influenced by external inputs.

Given these observations and applying the guidelines:

- The creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` with `new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1)` directly involves API parameters, making it a part of a potential sink.
- The invocation of `v1.start()` is on an object created using API inputs, which links its execution to the API's parameters indirectly.

Therefore, considering these instructions contribute to handling the API's input (even though `start()` does not follow positive rules directly without context), they can be grouped as part of a sink due to their sequential and logical dependency in processing the API's input:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v1.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This grouping is based on the direct data flow and creation linkages, ranking this as a coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink.
