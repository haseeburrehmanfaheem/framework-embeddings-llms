To assign an access control level to the `loadNanoAppOnHub` method, we need to consider the semantics of the API and its interactions with the provided sink code. 

The `loadNanoAppOnHub` method is used to load a nano app on a context hub, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper authorization and authentication. The method takes three parameters: `p1` (the ID of the context hub), `p2` (a callback interface for the transaction), and `p3` (the binary of the nano app to be loaded).

The sink code provided shows that the method uses `getCallingPackageName()` to get the package name of the calling application, which is then used to create a `ContextHubServiceTransaction` object. This suggests that the method is accessing sensitive information about the calling application.

Considering the similar APIs provided, both `enableNanoApp` and `unloadNanoAppFromHub` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require either system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs also interact with the same sinks as `loadNanoAppOnHub`, including `getCallingPackageName()` and `ContextHubServiceTransaction`.

Given the similarity in semantics and interactions with sinks, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `loadNanoAppOnHub` method. This ensures that only authorized applications with system or signature-level permission can load nano apps on a context hub.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
