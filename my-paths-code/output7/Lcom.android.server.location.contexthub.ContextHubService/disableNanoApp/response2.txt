To determine the access control level for the `disableNanoApp` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `disableNanoApp` API has three paths, but all of them involve the following steps:

1. Checking if the provided context hub ID is valid by looking it up in the `mContextHubIdToInfoMap`.
2. Creating a `ContextHubServiceTransaction` object using the `createDisableTransaction` method.
3. Adding the transaction to the `mTransactionQueue`.

The similar APIs, `enableNanoApp` and `unloadNanoAppFromHub`, have similar code structures and also involve creating transactions and adding them to queues.

All three APIs seem to be related to managing nano apps on a context hub, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper access control. The `enableNanoApp` and `unloadNanoAppFromHub` APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission.

Given the similarities between these APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `disableNanoApp` API should also have a similar access control level. Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, the access control level for the `disableNanoApp` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is made considering the sensitive nature of managing nano apps on a context hub and the need for proper access control to prevent unauthorized or malicious operations. The similarity in code structure and functionality with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level further supports this conclusion.
