To determine the access control level for the `getContextHubInfo` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis of `getContextHubInfo`:**
   - The method takes an integer parameter `p1`, which is used to retrieve a value from `mContextHubIdToInfoMap`.
   - It checks if the map contains the key `p1` and, if so, returns the corresponding value.
   - The sink code indicates interactions with `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` for both checking the presence of a key and retrieving a value.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **getContextHubHandles():** This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` to retrieve its key set, which implies access to potentially sensitive information about available context hub handles.
   - **createPendingIntentClient():** Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method uses `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` to get a client registered with specific parameters, indicating it deals with the registration process of clients, which might involve sensitive operations or data.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs (`getContextHubHandles()` and `createPendingIntentClient()`) are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting they operate on potentially sensitive data or perform actions that require system or signature-level permissions.
- The `getContextHubInfo` method, while seemingly less invasive as it only retrieves information based on an ID, still accesses `mContextHubIdToInfoMap`. This could be considered a sensitive operation if the information retrieved is critical to the functioning of context hub services or if the IDs themselves are sensitive.

However, considering the nature of `getContextHubInfo` which appears to be more about retrieval of existing information rather than creation, modification, or sensitive operations like client registration, it might not require as high a level of access control as `SYS_OR_SIG`. Yet, given its interaction with potentially sensitive system resources (`mContextHubIdToInfoMap`), it's unlikely to be classified as `NONE`.

Between `NORMAL` and `DANGEROUS`, without explicit indications that the method deals with user-private data or could cause harm if misused (e.g., financial transactions, personal data exposure), leaning towards `NORMAL` seems reasonable. This is because `NORMAL` typically covers a wide range of operations that are not completely innocuous but do not pose significant risks either.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality and comparing it with similar APIs, a cautious assignment would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision reflects the method's interaction with system resources in a manner that is informational and less likely to pose significant security or privacy risks directly.
