Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `createPendingIntentClient` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `createPendingIntentClient` method has two paths with depth 2, and both paths involve interactions with the `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` and `mHostEndPointIdToClientMap` maps. The method also creates a new `ContextHubClientBroker` object and adds it to the `mHostEndPointIdToClientMap`.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require either system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs also involve interactions with the `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` and `mHostEndPointIdToClientMap` maps, as well as creating a new `ContextHubClientBroker` object.

Given the similarities between the `createPendingIntentClient` method and the provided similar APIs, it is likely that the `createPendingIntentClient` method also requires system or signature-level permission to access. Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `createPendingIntentClient` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
