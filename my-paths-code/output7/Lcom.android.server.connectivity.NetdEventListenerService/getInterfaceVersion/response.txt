Since this method does not follow any of the positive rules (it doesn't have naming similarity with other methods or fields, it doesn't take input parameters as arguments, its return value isn't used by other potential sink cases, and it's a simple utility method), we can consider this method as not having any sinks according to our initial analysis.

However, given that for small APIs, all instructions should be considered part of a sink if no other rules apply, in the spirit of thoroughness but also adhering strictly to your guidelines which emphasize positive identification based on specific criteria, this API does indeed fall under the relaxation rule since it's simple and doesn't directly interact with sensitive data or operations that would suggest otherwise.

Therefore, considering all instructions for a small, straightforward API like this one:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public int getInterfaceVersion(){",
        "return 1;"
    ]
]
}
```

This captures the entirety of the method as it's both simple and doesn't directly link to other potential sinks through data flow or naming conventions.
