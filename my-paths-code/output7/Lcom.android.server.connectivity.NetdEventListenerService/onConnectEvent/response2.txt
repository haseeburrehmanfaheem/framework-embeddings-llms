Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `onConnectEvent` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onConnectEvent` method interacts with network metrics, network capabilities, and event callbacks. It collects network metrics snapshots, updates network metrics, and notifies event callbacks. The method's code is complex, with multiple conditional statements and object interactions.

The similar APIs, `onDnsEvent` and `onTcpSocketStatsEvent`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with network metrics, network capabilities, and event callbacks, which suggests that they are related to the `onConnectEvent` method in terms of functionality and security requirements.

After reviewing the code and similar APIs, I conclude that the `onConnectEvent` method does not require elevated privileges or access to sensitive data. The method's interactions with network metrics and event callbacks are consistent with the behavior of the similar APIs, which have an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `onConnectEvent` method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This access control level indicates that the `onConnectEvent` method does not require special permissions or access to sensitive data, and it can be executed without elevated privileges.
