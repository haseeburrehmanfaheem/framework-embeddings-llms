To determine the access control level for the `requestState` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `requestState` method interacts with several sinks, including:

1. `this.mProcessRecords.get(p4)`: This line retrieves a process record from a map, which may involve sensitive information.
2. `this.mOverrideRequestController.hasRequest(p5, 0)`: This line checks if an override request exists for a specific process, which could be related to device state management.
3. `DeviceStateManagerService.getStateLocked(p2)`: This line retrieves the current device state, which may involve sensitive information.
4. `new OverrideRequest(p5,p4,p2,p3,0)`: This line creates a new override request object, which could potentially modify device state.
5. `this.mOverrideRequestController.addRequest(v16)`: This line adds the new override request to a controller, which may involve modifying device state.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `requestBaseStateOverride(Landroid/os/IBinder;II)V`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and interacts with similar sinks, such as retrieving process records and adding override requests.
2. `notifySignalStrength(Landroid/os/IBinder;II)V`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and involves interacting with sensitive information, such as TV interactive app session states.

Considering the similarities between the `requestState` method and the provided APIs, it appears that the `requestState` method is also related to device state management and interacts with sensitive information. Therefore, a reasonable access control level for the `requestState` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it may require system or signature-level permissions to access and modify device state.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
