To assign an access control level to the `getDeviceStateInfo` method, we must analyze its functionality, sinks, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Functionality Analysis**: The `getDeviceStateInfo` method retrieves device state information. It checks for the presence of base and committed states within the device manager service and constructs a `DeviceStateInfo` object based on supported state identifiers and current state identifiers.

2. **Sink Analysis**: The sinks involved in this method include:
   - `DeviceStateManagerService.getSupportedStateIdentifiersLocked()`: This call interacts with the device state manager to fetch supported state identifiers, which is an internal operation.
   - `this.mBaseState.get()` and `this.mCommittedState.get()`: These calls retrieve current base and committed states of the device.
   - The construction of a new `DeviceStateInfo` object based on these states: This operation involves encapsulating device state information into a structured format.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **setDeviceStatus**: With a similarity score of 0.7562956213951111, this method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It sets the device status and notifies about the change, which involves modifying system-level information.
   - **isDeviceColorManaged**: Having a similarity score of 0.7322224378585815, its access control level is `NONE`. This method checks if the device color is managed internally without exposing or modifying sensitive system information.

**Decision**:
Given that `getDeviceStateInfo` primarily retrieves and encapsulates device state information without directly modifying any system-level settings or accessing sensitive user data, it does not seem to pose significant risks similar to those requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access control. However, since it deals with device state information which might be considered internal to the system's operation, assigning it a level of `NONE` could be appropriate if we consider that it doesn't directly interact with user-sensitive data or perform dangerous operations.

But considering the context and the potential for this information to be used in ways that could impact system security or privacy (even though it seems more related to device management), a cautious approach might lean towards requiring some form of access control. Yet, given the provided similar APIs and their access controls, `getDeviceStateInfo` doesn't seem to warrant `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` levels based on its current implementation.

Thus, considering it provides information about device states without directly impacting user data security or performing system modifications, the most fitting access control level, by comparison and the nature of its functionality, would be `NORMAL`. This reflects a balance between accessibility for legitimate uses within the system context and caution against misuse, though the final decision might depend on the specific Android version's security guidelines and the exact categorization criteria used.
