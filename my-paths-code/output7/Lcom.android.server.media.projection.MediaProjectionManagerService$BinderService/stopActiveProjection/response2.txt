To determine the access control level for the `stopActiveProjection` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `stopActiveProjection` method has two paths:

1. In the first path, it checks if `v2` is not equal to 0 and then clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`. It then checks if `mProjectionGrant` is null and calls `isValidMediaProjection` on the `this$0` object. If the projection is valid, it restores the calling identity using `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` and returns without performing any further actions.

2. In the second path, it performs similar checks as in the first path but also includes additional operations such as checking the app ops mode using `AppOpsManager` and stopping the projection using `this$0.stopProjectionLocked(p0)` if certain conditions are met.

The provided sink code snippet shows that the method stops an active media projection by calling `stop()` on the `MediaProjection` object.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- The `getActiveProjectionInfo()` methods have a similarity score of 0.80449378490448 and 0.7595173120498657, respectively, and both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods seem to be related to retrieving information about active media projections.

Given the operations performed by the `stopActiveProjection` method, such as stopping an active media projection and interacting with app ops, it appears that this method requires a certain level of system or signature permission to execute. This is because stopping a media projection could potentially impact the system's behavior or other applications' functionality.

Therefore, considering the code paths, the interaction with system-level components like `AppOpsManager`, and comparing with similar APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `stopActiveProjection` method should also have a similar access control level to ensure that only authorized components can stop active media projections.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the need for system or signature-level permission to perform actions that could impact system behavior or require specific authorization.
