To determine the access control level for the `getActiveProjectionInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of getActiveProjectionInfo**: This method checks if a projection grant exists (`this.mProjectionGrant != 0`) and if so, it retrieves and returns the projection info associated with this grant after clearing and then restoring the calling identity.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve getting the active projection info either directly or through another instance method, wrapped around calls to `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`. This pattern is indicative of operations that require careful management of the caller's identity to ensure security and integrity of the system services.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API, `addCallback(Landroid/media/projection/IMediaProjectionWatcherCallback;)V`, has a high similarity score with `getActiveProjectionInfo`. Both versions provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` in these similar APIs, as well as in the code snippet for `getActiveProjectionInfo`, suggests that managing caller identity is crucial for security. This pattern is typically associated with system-level operations that need to temporarily suspend the normal permission checking to perform tasks that require elevated access.

Given this information:

- **Security Considerations**: The method interacts with sensitive system components (`MediaProjectionManagerService`, `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`, and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`), which implies it operates at a level requiring strict access control.
  
- **Similarity to SYS_OR_SIG APIs**: The high similarity score with APIs that are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests that `getActiveProjectionInfo` also requires system-level or signature-level permissions to execute, given its involvement in managing projection grants and caller identities.

- **Conclusion**: Considering the method's functionality, its interaction with sensitive system services, and its similarity to other `SYS_OR_SIG` classified APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `getActiveProjectionInfo` should also be classified as requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This ensures that only authorized system components or applications signed with the platform key can invoke this method, thus protecting sensitive operations related to media projection management.

The final answer is: 
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
