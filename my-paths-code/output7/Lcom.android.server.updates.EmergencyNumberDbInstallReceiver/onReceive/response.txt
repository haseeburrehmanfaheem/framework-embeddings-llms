To identify potential sinks in the provided code snippet of the `onReceive` method, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Method Invocation**: The method creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` as parameters to its constructor. This is a creation of a new object with data flow from the API parameters (`p1` and `p2`). According to the positive rules, this action could be considered a potential sink because it involves creating an object with data that comes directly from the method's input parameters.

2. **Method Invocation on the Created Object**: The `start()` method is invoked on the newly created instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. This operation follows the positive rule of invoking methods on class instances (using the object reference). However, to confirm this as part of a sink, we need to understand if the data flow from the input parameters (`p1` and `p2`) is propagated through the `start()` method. Since the instance creation directly involves the API's input parameters, and then an operation (`start()`) is performed on that instance, there's a clear link in the data flow.

Given these observations, we can identify one potential sink set that includes both the object creation and the subsequent method invocation on that object. Here's how it could be represented in JSON format:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
        "v1.start();"
    ]
]
}
```

This representation captures the creation of a new object with parameters from the `onReceive` method and the subsequent invocation of `start()` on that object, indicating a coherent set of instructions where data flow is linked between them. The `p0` might seem unrelated at first glance since it's not directly mentioned as an input parameter of the `onReceive` method, but in the context of Java and Android development, `p0` often refers to the outer class instance (`this`) when dealing with inner classes or anonymous classes. Thus, its involvement does not break the data flow link but rather suggests that the operation might also depend on the state or context of the enclosing class instance.
