To determine the access control level for the `expireRollbackForPackage` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `expireRollbackForPackage` method creates a new instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7` and executes it asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.runAsync`. The result is then retrieved using `v11.get()`.

The similar APIs, `notifyStagedSession(I)I`, have a similarity score of 0.9824186563491821 and 0.9817450642585754, indicating a high degree of similarity with the `expireRollbackForPackage` method. Both `notifyStagedSession(I)I` methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Although the `expireRollbackForPackage` method does not return any value (i.e., it's a void method), whereas the `notifyStagedSession(I)I` methods return an integer, their underlying execution mechanisms are comparable. They all utilize `CompletableFuture` to run tasks asynchronously and retrieve results.

Given the similarities in code structure and the use of asynchronous execution, it is reasonable to infer that the `expireRollbackForPackage` method should have a similar access control level as the `notifyStagedSession(I)I` methods.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `expireRollbackForPackage` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
