To assign an access control level to the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method, let's analyze its similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

1. **Similarity with `blockRollbackManager(J)V`**: This API has a high similarity score of 0.9773675799369812. The `blockRollbackManager` method is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to rollback management are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permission.

2. **Similarity with `expireRollbackForPackage(Ljava/lang/String;)V`**: With a similarity score of 0.952835202217102, this method also deals with rollback management and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the notion that rollback-related operations are sensitive.

3. **Code Analysis of `snapshotAndRestoreUserData`**:
   - The method interacts with a `Handler` (`v3`) and posts a lambda expression (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda14`) to it. This interaction involves scheduling a task that presumably deals with user data snapshot and restoration, which could be sensitive.
   - The use of a `Handler` for posting tasks suggests asynchronous operation, potentially affecting system resources or user data.

Given these points:

- Both similar APIs (`blockRollbackManager` and `expireRollbackForPackage`) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their involvement in rollback management, which implies sensitivity.
- The `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method's operations, though slightly different, still fall within the realm of managing or affecting system state (user data snapshot and restoration), which could be considered sensitive.

Therefore, considering the similarities in functionality and the potential impact on system or user data, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `snapshotAndRestoreUserData`.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
