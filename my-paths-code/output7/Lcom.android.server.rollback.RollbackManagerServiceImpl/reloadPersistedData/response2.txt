To determine the access control level for the `reloadPersistedData` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `reloadPersistedData` method creates a new instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` and executes it asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.runAsync`. The method also checks if the current thread is the same as the looper's thread, and if not, it proceeds with the execution.

The sink code for this method shows that it interacts with the `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` instance in a similar way to the provided similar APIs.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. `expireRollbackForPackage(Ljava/lang/String;)V`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code creates a new instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7` and awaits its result using `p0.awaitResult(v3)`.
2. `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code creates a new instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8` and executes it asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. The `reloadPersistedData` method has a similar code structure and interacts with the same type of lambda instance, which implies that it may also require system or signature-level permissions.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `reloadPersistedData` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
