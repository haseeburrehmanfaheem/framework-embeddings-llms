To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableRollbacks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method involves checking the current thread state, enforcing manage rollbacks permission (`p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getAvailableRollbacks");`), and then asynchronously executing a task using `CompletableFuture`. This suggests that the method is interacting with system-level functionality related to rollback management, which typically requires specific permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets involve asynchronous execution of tasks related to rollbacks, which implies interaction with potentially sensitive or restricted system operations.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions.
   - The similarity in code structure and functionality (involving rollbacks and asynchronous task execution) between these APIs and `getAvailableRollbacks` suggests that `getAvailableRollbacks` might also require similar access control levels to protect the integrity of the rollback management process.

Given this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getAvailableRollbacks` method should have a similar access control level to its counterparts due to the nature of its operations and interactions with system-level functionalities. Therefore, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems appropriate for ensuring that only authorized components can manage rollbacks.
