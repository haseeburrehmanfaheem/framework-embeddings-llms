To determine the access control level for the `blockRollbackManager` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The key aspects to consider include the interactions with sinks (in this case, posting a lambda function to a handler) and the semantics of these interactions.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `blockRollbackManager` method posts a lambda function (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda13`) to a handler (`this.mHandler`). This operation involves scheduling a task to be executed on the thread associated with the handler, which could potentially involve interactions with system resources or other components that require specific permissions.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` has a high similarity score (0.9773675799369812) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also involves posting a lambda function to a handler, similar to the operation in `blockRollbackManager`.
   - The API `expireRollbackForPackage` has a similarity score of 0.9544312953948975 and is also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although it uses `awaitResult` instead of posting to a handler, the underlying semantic involves interacting with system components or services that likely require signature or system-level permissions.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` as their access control level, indicating they interact with system-level components or require signature-level permissions.
- The operation in `blockRollbackManager` (posting a lambda function to a handler) is similar in nature to the operations in the compared APIs, suggesting it may also require privileged access.

Therefore, considering the similarities in code and semantics with the provided APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `blockRollbackManager` API would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it likely interacts with system components or requires signature-level permissions similar to the compared APIs.
