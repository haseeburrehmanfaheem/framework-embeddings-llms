To determine the access control level for the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` involves checking the current thread state using `Looper.isCurrentThread()` and then enforces a manage rollbacks permission check via `p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks")`. This indicates that the method is sensitive to the caller's context and requires specific permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets involve asynchronous execution using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` and awaiting results, which suggests interaction with potentially sensitive operations or data.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getAvailableRollbacks`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are either system-internal or require a significant permission level.
   - These APIs also deal with rollbacks and use similar asynchronous execution patterns, suggesting their operations might be related to system-level management or sensitive data handling.

Given these points:

- The method interacts with potentially sensitive data or operations (rollbacks).
- It requires specific permissions (`manageRollbacks`).
- Similar APIs that interact with rollback data have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of the operation and the need for specific permissions, the most appropriate access control level for `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the similar APIs' access levels due to their operational similarity and the system's permission enforcement.
