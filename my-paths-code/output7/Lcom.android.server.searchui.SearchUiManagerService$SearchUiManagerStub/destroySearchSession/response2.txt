To determine the access control level for the `destroySearchSession` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs. The provided code snippets for `destroySearchSession` and its similar APIs (`notifyEvent`) show a pattern of handling user identities and checking temporary status before performing actions.

1. **Code Analysis**: 
   - The `destroySearchSession` method creates a lambda instance (`SearchUiManagerService$SearchUiManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda2`) with the provided `SearchSessionId`.
   - It retrieves an object related to `ActivityManagerInternal` class and handles the incoming user based on the calling PID, UID, and user ID.
   - A check is performed to see if the user is temporary. If not, it proceeds under specific conditions (like being a recents caller) and performs the action defined in the lambda instance after clearing and restoring the calling identity.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar `notifyEvent` methods have high similarity scores (>0.99), indicating their code logic is very close to `destroySearchSession`.
   - These methods also create a lambda instance with parameters (including `SearchSessionId`, `Query`, and `SearchTargetEvent`) and follow a pattern of handling user identities before accepting the action defined in the lambda.
   - Notably, both similar APIs have an assigned access control level of `NONE`.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that the similar APIs (`notifyEvent`) with high similarity scores are assigned an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the semantic similarities in handling user identities and performing actions based on lambda instances, it is reasonable to infer that `destroySearchSession` would also follow a similar access control pattern.
   - The actions performed by `destroySearchSession` do not explicitly indicate a need for elevated or restricted permissions beyond what's typically required for managing search sessions, which aligns with the `NONE` access control level.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the provided code snippets and the similarities with other APIs (`notifyEvent`) that have an access control level of `NONE`, it is logical to conclude that the `destroySearchSession` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
