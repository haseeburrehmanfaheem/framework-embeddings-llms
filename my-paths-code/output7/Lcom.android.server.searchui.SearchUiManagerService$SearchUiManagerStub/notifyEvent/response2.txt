To determine the access control level for the `notifyEvent` method, we should analyze its code snippet, sink code, and the provided similar APIs along with their access control levels.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `notifyEvent` method involves creating a lambda function (`SearchUiManagerService$SearchUiManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3`) that encapsulates the parameters passed to it.
   - It interacts with system services (e.g., `ActivityManagerInternal`, `AbstractMasterSystemService`, and `ServiceNameResolver`) to handle user-related operations, such as checking if a user is temporary or not.
   - The method also involves calling `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`, which are used to get the process ID and user ID of the caller, respectively. This indicates that the method might be performing some level of access control or authentication based on the caller's identity.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code paths show variations in how the lambda function is created and executed, but all involve interaction with system services to handle user-related operations.
   - These paths do not explicitly indicate dangerous operations like file I/O, network access, or direct hardware manipulation that would typically require higher levels of access control (e.g., `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`).

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The provided similar APIs (`destroySearchSession`) have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - These APIs share similarities with `notifyEvent` in terms of creating lambda functions and interacting with system services for user handling, but they do not seem to perform operations that would necessitate higher access control levels.

Given these observations:
- The `notifyEvent` method does not appear to engage in activities that would be classified as dangerous or requiring special system or signal privileges.
- Its interactions are more aligned with internal service management and user handling, which seems to be managed through the existing system service frameworks without explicit need for elevated permissions like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations of this nature do not require strict access controls.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `notifyEvent` method would be `NORMAL`. This is because it involves internal system service interactions and user handling but does not explicitly engage in dangerous or privileged operations that would necessitate higher levels of access control.
