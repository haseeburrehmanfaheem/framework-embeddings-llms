To assign an access control level to the `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method involves getting the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`. It then proceeds to handle user states and session states within the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService`, eventually notifying a session about broadcast info response if the session exists.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `ITvInteractiveAppSession` and handling of user and session states, which are crucial for managing TV interactive app sessions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **createSession**: This API has a similarity score of 0.9470165967941284 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It creates a new session state without directly interacting with sensitive operations that would require higher access control levels.
   - **notifySignalStrength**: With a similarity score of 0.9419936537742615, this API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it involves system or signal-level interactions that are more restricted.

Given these analyses:

- The `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method interacts with the system to manage sessions and notify about broadcast information. This interaction does not seem to directly involve sensitive user data or dangerous operations but does require system-level access to manage sessions and notify them.
- The similarity with `createSession` (access control level of `NONE`) suggests that while it's involved in session management, it doesn't necessarily deal with sensitive or dangerous operations directly. However, its interaction with system services (like managing sessions and notifying them) might imply a need for a certain level of access control.
- The similarity with `notifySignalStrength` (access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`) indicates that the method's operations could be considered significant enough to warrant system or signal-level access control due to its involvement in managing and notifying sessions about broadcast information.

Considering these points, the method seems to require more than `NONE` level access due to its system-level interactions but doesn't explicitly deal with user-sensitive data or dangerous operations that would typically warrant a `DANGEROUS` access control level. However, given its system-level nature and the need for managing sessions securely, it leans towards requiring a level of access control that acknowledges its system-level operations without being overly permissive.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it reflects the method's involvement in system-level operations (managing and notifying sessions) without directly implicating sensitive user data or dangerous capabilities.
