Based on the provided API code for `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` across three different paths with varying depths, we can identify potential sinks by analyzing data flows and method invocations.

Here is the JSON representation of the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int v2 = Binder.getCallingPid();",
      "ITvInteractiveAppSession v7 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked(p2, p3, v10);",
      "ITvInteractiveAppSession v14 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fgetmSession(p2);",
      "v12.notifyBroadcastInfoResponse(p2);"
    ],
    [
      "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int v4 = this.this$0.resolveCallingUserId(v2, v1, p3, \"notifyBroadcastInfoResponse\");",
      "TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState v8 = this.this$0.getSessionStateLocked(p1, v1, v3);",
      "ITvInteractiveAppSession v10 = this.this$0.getSessionLocked(v7);",
      "v9.notifyBroadcastInfoResponse(p2);"
    ],
    [
      "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int v3 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(this.this$0, v2, v1, p3, \"notifyBroadcastInfoResponse\");",
      "TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState v6 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionStateLocked(this.this$0, p1, v1, v3);",
      "ITvInteractiveAppSession v7 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked(this.this$0, v6);",
      "v7.notifyBroadcastInfoResponse(p2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Each set of instructions in the `Sinks` array represents a coherent data flow that together contributes to a potential sink. These sinks are ranked based on their sensitivity and the direct influence one instruction has over another.

The primary focus is on method invocations, especially those related to session management (`getSessionStateLocked`, `getSessionLocked`) and notification handling (`notifyBroadcastInfoResponse`), as they directly process or utilize the input parameters or intermediate results. The invocation of these methods and the flow of data through them indicate potential sinks according to the provided positive rules.

The instructions involving `Binder.getCallingUid()`, `Binder.getCallingPid()`, and `resolveCallingUserId` are crucial for understanding the context in which these sessions are managed, as they relate to user identity and access control. However, their primary role is auxiliary (obtaining user IDs and PIDs), which, while important for security and logging purposes, does not directly contribute to the creation or manipulation of sensitive data within the API's logic flow.

The `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method invocations on `ITvInteractiveAppSession` objects (`v12.notifyBroadcastInfoResponse(p2);`, `v9.notifyBroadcastInfoResponse(p2);`, `v7.notifyBroadcastInfoResponse(p2);`) are key points of interest, as they represent the culmination of the data flow and session management logic within each path. These method calls directly utilize the input parameters or results from previous computations, making them central to identifying potential sinks in the API's implementation.
