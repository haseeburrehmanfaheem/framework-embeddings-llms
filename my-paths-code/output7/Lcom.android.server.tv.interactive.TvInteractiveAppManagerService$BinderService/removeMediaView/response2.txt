To determine the access control level for the `removeMediaView` method, we should consider its similarity to other APIs and how those similar APIs are assigned in terms of access control. The provided similar APIs, `relayoutMediaView` and `createMediaView`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to media views within the context of `TvInteractiveAppManagerService` are considered sensitive or system-internal, thus requiring either system or signature-level permissions.

Looking at the code snippet for `removeMediaView`, it involves handling user IDs, locking mechanisms (`Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v6)`), and interaction with session states and media sessions. These operations imply a level of privilege and trust that is not typically granted to arbitrary applications without some form of permission or access control.

Given the similarities in functionality (all three methods interact with media views in the context of TV interactive app management) and considering the access control levels assigned to `relayoutMediaView` and `createMediaView`, it's reasonable to conclude that `removeMediaView` should also have a similar access control level. The operations performed by these methods are not standard or normal for general applications, suggesting they should be protected at a higher level than `NONE` or `NORMAL`.

Therefore, considering the context, functionality, and assigned access controls of similar APIs, the final access control level for the `removeMediaView` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination aligns with the system's need to protect sensitive operations and maintain a secure environment for managing TV interactive app sessions and media views.
