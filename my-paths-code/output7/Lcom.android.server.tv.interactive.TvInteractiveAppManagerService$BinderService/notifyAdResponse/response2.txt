To determine the access control level for the `notifyAdResponse` method, we should analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `notifyAdResponse` method involves several key steps:
1. It retrieves the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
2. It handles the incoming user through `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()`, which suggests interaction with user management and potentially sensitive operations.
3. It acquires a user state and session state locked, indicating it's working within the context of a specific user and session.
4. Finally, it notifies an ad response via `ITvInteractiveAppSession.notifyAdResponse(p2)`, which is an operation related to interactive TV applications.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:
- `notifyContentBlocked` has a similarity score of 0.9745718240737915 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows similar operations, including handling the incoming user and notifying a session about blocked content.
- `stopInteractiveApp` has a similarity score of 0.9680923819541931 and also an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It too involves handling the incoming user and stopping an interactive app session.

Both similar APIs have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to execute due to their interaction with sensitive operations like user management and session control within the TV interactive app context.

Given these similarities in both functionality and access control levels of the comparable APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `notifyAdResponse` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because it involves similar sensitive operations such as handling user states and notifying sessions within the TV interactive app management service.

Therefore, based on the analysis and comparison with other similar APIs:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
