To assign an access control level to the `startInteractiveApp` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `startInteractiveApp` method has a similarity score of 0.9450619220733643 with the `notifyContentAllowed` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The similarity score indicates that these two methods share many similarities in their code structure and functionality.

Similarly, the `startInteractiveApp` method has a similarity score of 0.9333088397979736 with the `destroyBiInteractiveApp` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Upon reviewing the code snippets of these similar APIs, we notice that they all interact with the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface and perform operations related to interactive TV apps. The `startInteractiveApp` method follows a similar pattern, where it retrieves a session state and starts an interactive app if the session is valid.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality, as well as the access control levels of the comparable APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `startInteractiveApp` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `startInteractiveApp` API:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the similarities between the `startInteractiveApp` method and the comparable APIs, which all require a system or signature-level permission to interact with the TV interactive app session.
