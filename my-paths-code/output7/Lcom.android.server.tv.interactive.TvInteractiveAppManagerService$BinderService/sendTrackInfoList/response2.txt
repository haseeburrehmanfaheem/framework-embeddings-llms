To determine the access control level for the `sendTrackInfoList` method, we'll analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method involves several steps, including getting the calling user ID and process ID, handling incoming users, acquiring a lock, and getting or creating user and session states. It then checks if an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object exists and calls its `sendTrackInfoList` method if it does.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves handling the incoming user, getting a session state, and accessing an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object to call its `sendTrackInfoList` method. This suggests interaction with potentially sensitive data or functionality related to TV interactive app sessions.

3. **Similar APIs Comparison**:
   - **notifyTrackSelected**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9252365231513977) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves similar steps, such as handling the incoming user and interacting with session states and `ITvInteractiveAppSession` objects.
   - **createMediaView**: Although its similarity score (0.8749372363090515) is slightly lower, it's still significant, and this API is also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its interactions include handling incoming users and working with session states and locked sessions.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs are assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their interaction with system-level functionalities (like handling incoming users and working with app sessions), which suggests that they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute.
- The `sendTrackInfoList` method follows a similar pattern of interacting with sensitive system functionalities, such as session management and user handling.

Therefore, considering the similarities in functionality and the need for protected access to system resources, the most appropriate access control level for the `sendTrackInfoList` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
