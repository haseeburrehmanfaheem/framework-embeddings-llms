Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method. 

The `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method interacts with sensitive components such as `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`, and `ITvInteractiveAppSession.dispatchSurfaceChanged`. These interactions suggest that the method is handling user-specific data and session states, which may require elevated access control.

The similar APIs provided also indicate a pattern of requiring high access control levels. The `dispatchSurfaceChanged` API with a similarity score of 0.9665704965591431 has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and the `setSurface` API with a similarity score of 0.9617912769317627 also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that methods interacting with session states and user data in this context typically require system or signature-level access control.

Given the similarities in code patterns, interaction with sensitive components, and the access control levels of similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
