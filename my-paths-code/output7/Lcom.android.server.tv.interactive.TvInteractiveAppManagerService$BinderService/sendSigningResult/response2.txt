Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `sendSigningResult` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `sendSigningResult` method interacts with the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface, which is also used by the similar APIs `notifyAdResponse`. The similarity scores between `sendSigningResult` and `notifyAdResponse` are high (0.9222643375396729 and 0.9197076559066772), indicating that these methods share similar functionality and possibly security requirements.

Both similar APIs (`notifyAdResponse`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface. The code snippets provided for `notifyAdResponse` also show similarities with the sink code of `sendSigningResult`, such as accessing the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object through the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState` class.

Given these observations, it is likely that the `sendSigningResult` method requires similar access control to ensure secure interaction with the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface. Therefore, I conclude that the access control level for the `sendSigningResult` API should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
