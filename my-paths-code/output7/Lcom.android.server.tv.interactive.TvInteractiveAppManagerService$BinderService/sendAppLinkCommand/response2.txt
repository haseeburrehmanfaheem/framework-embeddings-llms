To determine the access control level for the `sendAppLinkCommand` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `sendAppLinkCommand` method interacts with the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService` and performs several operations, including:

1. Handling incoming users using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`.
2. Getting or creating a user state using `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getUserStateLocked` or `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`.
3. Adding pending app link commands to the `mPendingAppLinkCommand` list.
4. Updating service connections and binding to services using `bindServiceAsUser`.

The similar APIs, `notifyAdResponse` and `notifyContentBlocked`, also interact with the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService` and perform similar operations, such as handling incoming users and getting or creating user states.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access the TV interactive app management service.

Based on the similarities between the `sendAppLinkCommand` method and the provided APIs, it is likely that the `sendAppLinkCommand` method also requires system or signature-level permissions to access the TV interactive app management service.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `sendAppLinkCommand` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signed applications can access the TV interactive app management service and perform operations such as sending app link commands.
