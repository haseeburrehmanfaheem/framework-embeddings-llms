To determine the access control level for the `notifyTracksChanged` method, we should consider its similarity to other APIs and how those similar APIs interact with sinks, as well as their assigned access control levels.

The provided API, `notifyTracksChanged`, has a high similarity score with two other APIs: 
1. `notifyContentAllowed` (Similarity Score: 0.9079617261886597)
2. `notifyAdResponse` (Similarity Score: 0.9077016115188599)

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that they are considered to be either system-internal or require a signature permission to be accessed, indicating a higher level of security requirement due to their potential impact on the system's behavior and user data.

Looking at the code snippet for `notifyTracksChanged`, it involves getting the calling UID and PID, handling incoming users, and interacting with session states and ITV interactive app sessions. These operations imply that the method is dealing with sensitive information related to user sessions and app interactions, which could potentially impact system security or user privacy if not properly controlled.

Given these observations:
- The method's similarity to `notifyContentAllowed` and `notifyAdResponse`, both of which have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
- The nature of the operations performed by `notifyTracksChanged`, which involve sensitive session and user data.

It is reasonable to conclude that `notifyTracksChanged` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to ensure that only authorized system components or applications with the appropriate signature permissions can invoke this method, thereby protecting system integrity and user privacy.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
