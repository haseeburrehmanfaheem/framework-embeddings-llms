To determine the access control level for the `destroyBiInteractiveApp` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `destroyBiInteractiveApp` method appears to interact with the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface, specifically calling the `destroyBiInteractiveApp` method on an instance of this interface. This interaction is similar to the `startInteractiveApp` and `notifyContentAllowed` methods, which also interact with the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface.

The similarity scores between `destroyBiInteractiveApp` and the other two APIs are high (0.9333088397979736 and 0.926857590675354), indicating that they share similar code structures and functionality.

Both `startInteractiveApp` and `notifyContentAllowed` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Given the similarities between these APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `destroyBiInteractiveApp` also requires a similar level of access control. Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the access control level for the `destroyBiInteractiveApp` method should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is consistent with the access control levels of the similar APIs, reflecting the method's interaction with system-level components and the need for elevated permissions to perform its functionality.
