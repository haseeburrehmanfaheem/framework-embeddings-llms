Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method appears to be interacting with the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$UserState` and `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$ServiceState` objects, which are also present in the similar APIs. The method is modifying the state of these objects and adding/removing elements from maps.

The similar APIs, `registerAppLinkInfo`, have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the registration of app link information does not require any specific permissions or access controls.

Considering the similarities between the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method and the `registerAppLinkInfo` APIs, it is likely that the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method also does not require any specific permissions or access controls. The method seems to be a complementary operation to registration, and it is reasonable to assume that if registration is allowed without restrictions, then unregistration should also be allowed without restrictions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and the code snippet provided, I conclude that the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
