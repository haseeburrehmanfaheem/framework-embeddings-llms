To determine the access control level for the `notifyVideoAvailable` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs (`notifyAdResponse` and `setSurface`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to interactive TV app sessions are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method interacts with `TvInteractiveAppManagerService`, which is responsible for managing TV interactive app sessions.
   - It uses `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` to handle user IDs, indicating a need to manage and secure access based on user identities.
   - The method accesses and modifies session states (`TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState`) and notifies the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface about video availability. This kind of interaction with session management and notification suggests a level of privilege that should be protected.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves resolving the calling user ID, getting or creating user states, and accessing session states. These operations imply a need for controlled access to prevent unauthorized manipulation of TV interactive app sessions.
   - The `notifyVideoAvailable` call on `ITvInteractiveAppSession` suggests that this method can influence the state of ongoing sessions, which should be a secured operation.

Considering these points:

- The operations performed by `notifyVideoAvailable` are similar in nature and sensitivity to those of `notifyAdResponse` and `setSurface`, both of which require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.
- The method's interaction with session management and notification mechanisms implies a need for protection against unauthorized access or manipulation.

**Conclusion**: Given the similarities in functionality and security requirements with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, and considering the sensitive nature of managing TV interactive app sessions, it is reasonable to conclude that the `notifyVideoAvailable` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
