To determine the access control level for the `notifyTrackSelected` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `notifyTrackSelected` method involves several key steps:
   - It retrieves the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
   - It handles the incoming user via `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, which suggests it's dealing with user-specific data or sessions.
   - It acquires a lock (`TvInteractiveAppManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock`) to access session states safely, indicating multi-threading considerations.
   - It gets or creates a user state and then retrieves a session state based on the provided parameters.
   - Finally, it notifies an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` instance about track selection if such a session exists.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The `setSurface` API has a similarity score of 0.9665346145629883 and is assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Its code involves handling the incoming user, getting a session state, and setting a surface for an interactive app session.
   - The `notifyAdResponse` API has a similarity score of 0.9653128385543823, also with the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. It handles the incoming user, gets or creates a user state, retrieves a session state, and notifies an ad response.

Given these similarities:
- All methods interact with sessions and user states in a similar manner.
- They all use `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, which suggests they are handling user-specific data securely.
- The operations (setting surface, notifying ad response, or track selection) seem to be part of managing interactive TV app sessions, which could require system or signature-level permissions due to their nature of affecting the state of other apps or system resources.

**Conclusion**: Based on the code analysis and comparison with similar APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that the `notifyTrackSelected` method should also be assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This is because it deals with sensitive operations related to interactive TV app sessions and user states, which likely require system or signature-level permissions to ensure secure and controlled access.
