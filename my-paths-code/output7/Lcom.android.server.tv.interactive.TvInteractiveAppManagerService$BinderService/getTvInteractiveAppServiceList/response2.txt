Based on the provided information, I will analyze the access control level for the `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList` method.

The method interacts with sensitive data, such as the list of TV interactive app services, and performs operations that require proper authorization. The similar APIs, `stopInteractiveApp` and `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

The `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList` method also uses the `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` method, which is used to handle incoming user requests and requires proper authorization. Additionally, it accesses the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$UserState` object, which contains sensitive information about the user's interactive app sessions.

Considering these factors, I conclude that the `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList` method requires a similar level of access control as the similar APIs.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level authorized components can access the `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList` method, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.
