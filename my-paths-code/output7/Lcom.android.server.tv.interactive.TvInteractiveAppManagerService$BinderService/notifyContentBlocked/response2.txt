To determine the access control level for the `notifyContentBlocked` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippet for `notifyContentBlocked` shows that it:

1. Retrieves the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
2. Handles the incoming user using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()`, which suggests a check related to user management.
3. Acquires a lock on `TvInteractiveAppManagerService` and gets or creates a user state locked, then retrieves a session state locked based on parameters.
4. If an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object is found, it calls the `notifyContentBlocked` method on that object.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `notifyAdResponse(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/media/tv/AdResponse;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.9745718240737915 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `stopInteractiveApp(Landroid/os/IBinder;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.9656726717948914 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, which typically indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permissions to be called.

The code patterns in `notifyContentBlocked` are similar to those in the provided similar APIs, involving user handling and session management within the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService`. Given this similarity and the fact that both comparable methods have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that `notifyContentBlocked` should also be assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

This conclusion is based on the method's interaction with system-level services (like `ActivityManager`) and its involvement in managing sessions within `TvInteractiveAppManagerService`, which are typically restricted operations requiring elevated permissions.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `notifyContentBlocked` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
