Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `sendCurrentChannelUri` method.

The `sendCurrentChannelUri` method has a similarity score of 0.9626373052597046 with two other APIs: `sendAppPrivateCommand` and `timeShiftSeekTo`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Upon examining the code snippets, we notice that all three methods (`sendCurrentChannelUri`, `sendAppPrivateCommand`, and `timeShiftSeekTo`) call `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, which suggests that they are handling user-related operations.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality, it is reasonable to infer that the `sendCurrentChannelUri` method should have a similar access control level as the other two APIs.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I conclude that the access control level for the `sendCurrentChannelUri` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
