After analyzing the provided code paths for the `resetInteractiveApp` API, I've identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int v2 = Binder.getCallingPid();",
      "ITvInteractiveAppSession v14 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fgetmSession(p2);",
      "v14.resetInteractiveApp();"
    ],
    [
      "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int v2 = Binder.getCallingPid();",
      "ITvInteractiveAppSession v10 = this.this$0.getSessionLocked(v7);",
      "v9.resetInteractiveApp();"
    ],
    [
      "int v1 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int v2 = Binder.getCallingPid();",
      "ITvInteractiveAppSession v7 = TvInteractiveAppManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked(this.this$0, v6);",
      "v7.resetInteractiveApp();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

In each path, the `resetInteractiveApp` method is invoked on an instance of `ITvInteractiveAppSession`, which has a naming similarity with the API name. The input parameters `p1` and `p2` are used to obtain the session state and subsequently invoke the `resetInteractiveApp` method.

The sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact:

1. The first sink involves invoking `resetInteractiveApp` directly on an instance of `ITvInteractiveAppSession`, which has a high level of sensitivity.
2. The second sink also invokes `resetInteractiveApp` on an instance of `ITvInteractiveAppSession`, but with additional method calls to obtain the session state.
3. The third sink is similar to the first two, but with a different code path.

Each instruction in the sinks is copied verbatim from the provided code and follows at least one of the positive rules.
