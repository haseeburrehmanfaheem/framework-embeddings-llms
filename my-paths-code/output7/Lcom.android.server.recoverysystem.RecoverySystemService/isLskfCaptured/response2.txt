To determine the access control level for the `isLskfCaptured` method, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs, `clearLskf` and `rebootWithLskfAssumeSlotSwitch`, which both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The `isLskfCaptured` method checks if a given string (`p1`) is contained within `mCallerPreparedForReboot`. This operation does not seem to directly modify sensitive data or perform actions that would typically require high-level permissions like `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, the presence of similar APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control suggests that operations related to LSKF (likely referring to Logical Secure Key Framework or a similar concept) are considered sensitive.

Given the nature of `isLskfCaptured`, which is essentially a query operation without direct modification of system state or sensitive data, one might initially consider it as less critical than the `SYS_OR_SIG` level operations. However, considering the context provided by similar APIs and the potential implications of LSKF on system security and functionality, it's essential to align its access control with the principles guiding those similar APIs.

Despite this, `isLskfCaptured` does not directly interact with sensitive operations like clearing reboot escrow or initiating a reboot as seen in the provided similar APIs. Its operation is more aligned with querying or checking a status, which generally would be less sensitive than the actions performed by `clearLskf` and `rebootWithLskfAssumeSlotSwitch`.

Given these considerations, if we were to strictly follow the logic of access control based on the sensitivity and impact of the operations, `isLskfCaptured` might seem like a candidate for a lower access control level due to its read-only nature. However, since it's closely related to system functionalities that are protected at the `SYS_OR_SIG` level (as indicated by the similar APIs), and without explicit guidance otherwise, we must consider the broader context of system security.

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
