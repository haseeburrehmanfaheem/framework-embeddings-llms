To determine the access control level for the `getCpuUsages` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getCpuUsages` method takes a `String` parameter and returns `CpuUsageInfo`.
   - It checks certain conditions (`v9 == 0`, `v6 == 0`, and `v10 == 0`) before calling `HardwarePropertiesManagerService.nativeGetCpuUsages()` to retrieve CPU usage information.
   - The presence of a check for `isCurrentVrListener` suggests that the method is aware of and interacts with VR listener states, which might imply some level of system or sensitive data access.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets involve retrieving CPU usage information directly via `HardwarePropertiesManagerService.nativeGetCpuUsages()` or after checking if a specific account is the current VR listener.
   - This indicates that the method's primary interaction is with system-level services to gather hardware properties, specifically CPU usages.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API provided (`removeAccountAsUser`) has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permissions.
   - This API interacts with device policy management and checks for active profile or device owners, which is a sensitive operation requiring specific permissions.

Considering these points:

- **Sensitive Data Access**: The method accesses CPU usage information, which could be considered sensitive in certain contexts but does not directly manipulate user data or perform actions that require high-level permissions like changing system settings or accessing private user information.
- **System Interaction**: It interacts with system services to retrieve hardware properties, suggesting a need for some level of access control but not necessarily at the highest levels (like `SYS_OR_SIG`) unless it's directly influencing system behavior or security.

Given these considerations and comparing with the provided similar API, the `getCpuUsages` method seems less intrusive than `removeAccountAsUser`, which deals with account management and device ownership. However, accessing hardware properties like CPU usage could still be considered a potentially sensitive operation that should not be entirely unrestricted.

Thus, considering the need for some level of access control without clear evidence of requiring system or signature-level permissions based solely on the information provided, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects the method's interaction with system services and potential sensitivity of CPU usage data without indicating a requirement for the highest levels of permission.
