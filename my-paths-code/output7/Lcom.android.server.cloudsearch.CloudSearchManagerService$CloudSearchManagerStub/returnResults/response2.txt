To determine the access control level for the `returnResults` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `returnResults` method involves several key operations:

1. **Creation of a lambda object**: It creates an instance of `CloudSearchManagerService$CloudSearchManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda1`, which is used to handle some operation related to search results.
2. **Check for temporary status and caller identity**: The method checks if the service name resolver indicates a temporary status and verifies the caller's identity using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and checks if the caller is a recents app.
3. **Service list retrieval and iteration**: It retrieves a list of services for a user and iterates over this list to perform some action on each item, specifically calling `accept` on the lambda object created earlier.

The similar APIs provided are `unregisterSmartspaceUpdates` and `notifySmartspaceEvent`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also involve creating a lambda object and performing operations based on caller identity and service status. The key similarities include:

- **Lambda creation and usage**: All methods create a lambda object to encapsulate some operation.
- **Caller verification**: They all verify the caller's identity or status, though the specifics can vary (e.g., checking for recents app vs. other types of verification).
- **Service-related operations**: Each method interacts with services in some way, whether it's smartspace updates, events, or search results.

Given these similarities and considering that `unregisterSmartspaceUpdates` and `notifySmartspaceEvent` are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically involves system-level operations or signature-protected actions, the `returnResults` method seems to follow a similar pattern. It interacts with system services, checks caller identities, and performs actions based on these checks, suggesting it requires a comparable level of access control.

Therefore, considering the code structure, the interaction with system components, and the similarity in operational flow with other APIs classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, the most appropriate access control level for the `returnResults` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
