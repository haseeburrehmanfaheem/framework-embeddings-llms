To determine the access control level for the `getUidsWithPolicy` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The `getUidsWithPolicy` method seems to be interacting with a mapping or policy related to UIDs (User IDs) and their associated policies or permissions.

1. **Code Analysis**: 
   - The method iterates over a collection (`this.mUidPolicy`) that maps UIDs to certain policies or values.
   - It checks the policy value against an input parameter `p1` and based on this comparison, it decides whether to include a UID in the result set.
   - The use of `ArrayUtils.appendInt` suggests that the method is building an array of UIDs that match certain criteria based on `p1`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves accessing the size of `mUidPolicy`, retrieving keys and values from it, and appending integers to an array.
   - These operations suggest interaction with sensitive data (UIDs and their policies), but they do not directly imply modification or access that would typically require high-level permissions like `SYS_OR_SIG` unless the context of these UIDs and policies is highly sensitive.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `getUidPolicy(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`: This method retrieves a policy for a given UID, which could be considered sensitive as it directly accesses specific user policy information.
   - `setUidPolicy(II)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`: This method sets a policy for a UID, which involves modifying the state of user policies and could have significant implications on system behavior or security.

Given these points:
- The `getUidsWithPolicy` method does not appear to modify system state or access highly sensitive information that would necessitate a `SYS_OR_SIG` level of access control.
- It interacts with UID policies, which might be considered somewhat sensitive but is more aligned with retrieving information rather than modifying system settings or accessing very sensitive data.

Therefore, considering the provided similar APIs and their access control levels, the most appropriate access control level for the `getUidsWithPolicy` method seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects its role in retrieving policy-related information without directly implying system modification or highly sensitive data access that would require `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions.
