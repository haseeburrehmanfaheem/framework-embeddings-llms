To assign an access control level to the `getRestrictBackground` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other provided APIs (`getRestrictBackgroundStatus(I)I` and `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller()I`) that have known access control levels. Both of these similar APIs are assigned a NORMAL access control level.

Here's the reasoning for assigning an access control level:

1. **Similarity in Functionality**: The `getRestrictBackground` method retrieves a boolean value indicating whether background restrictions are applied, which is somewhat related to what `getRestrictBackgroundStatus(I)I` and `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller()I` do. They all seem to deal with the status or state of background restrictions in some form.

2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have been assigned a NORMAL access control level. This suggests that operations related to checking or retrieving the status of background restrictions are not considered highly sensitive or dangerous, as they do not directly modify system settings or access sensitive user data without proper authorization.

3. **Nature of the `getRestrictBackground` Method**: The method simply returns a boolean value (`this.mRestrictBackground`) without any visible checks, modifications, or interactions that could be deemed dangerous (like accessing sensitive data or modifying system settings). This simplicity aligns with operations that are typically considered NORMAL in terms of access control.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getRestrictBackground` method should also have a NORMAL access control level. It does not seem to pose significant risks like methods categorized under DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG would (e.g., those requiring specific permissions to execute or affecting system integrity directly), nor does it appear completely unrestricted as something labeled NONE might imply.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getRestrictBackground` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
