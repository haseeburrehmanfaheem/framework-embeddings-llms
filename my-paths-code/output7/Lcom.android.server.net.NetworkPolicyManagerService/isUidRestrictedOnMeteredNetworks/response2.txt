To determine the access control level for the `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs provided.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method checks if a UID (User ID) is restricted on metered networks.
   - It retrieves the blocked state for the given UID from `mUidBlockedState` and checks if the result is not null (`v2 != 0`).
   - The condition `(& -65536) == 0` seems to be a bitwise operation, but its context or purpose isn't clear without more information about the class or constants used. However, this doesn't directly influence the access control decision based on the provided similar APIs.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code focuses on retrieving the blocked state for a UID (`Object v2 = this.mUidBlockedState.get(p1);`) and checking if it's not null.
   - This operation is about accessing or querying the state of network restrictions for a specific user ID, which implies interaction with potentially sensitive system settings.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`isUidNetworkingBlocked(IZ)Z`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to access.
   - These methods also interact with the blocked state of UIDs, logging or buffering network blockage reasons for specific UIDs.
   - The high similarity score suggests that `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` serves a related purpose within the system's network policy management.

Given these points, assigning an access control level to `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` should consider the sensitivity of the information it accesses and the system-level operations it might perform. Since both similar APIs are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the method's interaction with potentially sensitive system settings (network restrictions for UIDs), it's reasonable to conclude that `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` should also be classified under a similar or stricter access control level due to its related functionality.

However, without explicit evidence of it performing system-level modifications or accessing highly sensitive information beyond what's shown in the similar APIs, and considering its primary function seems to be querying the state rather than altering it, the most appropriate classification based on the provided information would align with the similar APIs.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level for their interaction with UID blocked states and network policy management, `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` should be assigned a similar access control level due to its related functionality in querying network restriction states for UIDs.
