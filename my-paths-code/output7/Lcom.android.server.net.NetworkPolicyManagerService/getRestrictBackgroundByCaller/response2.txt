To determine the access control level for the `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller`:**
   - The method calls `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the UID of the calling process.
   - It then returns a hardcoded value `v3 = 3`, which suggests that this method does not directly interact with sensitive data or operations based on the provided code snippet. However, the return value seems static and does not reflect any dynamic assessment based on the caller's UID.

2. **Sink Code:**
   - The sink code snippet shows a call to `getRestrictBackgroundStatusInternal(v2)`, where `v2` is the UID of the calling process obtained via `Binder.getCallingUid()`. This implies that the actual logic for determining the restriction status might be implemented in `getRestrictBackgroundStatusInternal`, which is not shown in the provided code snippet for `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller`.

3. **Similar APIs:**
   - **`getRestrictBackgroundStatus(I)I`:** This API has a similarity score of 0.8678849935531616 with `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` and is assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. It directly calls `getRestrictBackgroundStatusInternal(p1)`, suggesting that the core logic for assessing background restriction status might be centralized in `getRestrictBackgroundStatusInternal`.
   - **`setRestrictBackground(Z)V`:** This API has a lower similarity score of 0.8366760611534119 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves setting the restrict background flag, which implies modifying system settings or behaviors based on the calling process's identity.

Given these observations:

- The `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` method seems to be inquiry-based (retrieving information) rather than modification-based. Its logic for determining the background restriction status is not fully exposed in the provided code snippet but appears to involve a static return value, which does not directly correlate with sensitive operations.
- The similarity with `getRestrictBackgroundStatus(I)I` suggests that these methods might be part of a related functionality set focused on querying status rather than altering system settings.
- The access control level for similar APIs, especially `getRestrictBackgroundStatus(I)I`, suggests that inquiry-based operations in this domain are considered `NORMAL`.

Considering the above points and focusing on the nature of the operation (`get RestrictBackgroundByCaller` appears to be an inquiry about status rather than a modification or sensitive data access), the most appropriate access control level for `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` seems to align with that of information retrieval APIs in this context.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippets and the access control levels of similar APIs:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision is guided by the method's apparent focus on retrieving status information without directly modifying system settings or accessing sensitive data, aligning with the `NORMAL` access control level assigned to similar inquiry-based methods in this domain.
