The method getNetworkPolicies has the following code snippet:

This is path 1 for the API with depth 0:
public NetworkPolicy getNetworkPolicies(String p1){
	if (v5 == 0) {
		NetworkPolicy v6 = new NetworkPolicy(0);
		return v6;
	}
}
This is path 2 for the API with depth 0:
public NetworkPolicy getNetworkPolicies(String p1){
	if (v5 == 0) {
		int v6 = this.mNetworkPolicy.size();
		NetworkPolicy v7 = new NetworkPolicy(v6);
		if ( >= v6) {
			Object v8 = this.mNetworkPolicy.valueAt();
			if ( >= v6) {
				return v7;
			}
		}
	}
}
This is path 3 for the API with depth 0:
public NetworkPolicy getNetworkPolicies(String p1){
	int v3 = this.mNetworkPolicy.size();
	NetworkPolicy v4 = new NetworkPolicy(v3);
	if ( >= v3) {
		Object v5 = this.mNetworkPolicy.valueAt();
		if ( >= v3) {
			return v4;
		}
	}
}

and the following sink code:
['int v6 = this.mNetworkPolicy.size();\nNetworkPolicy v7 = new NetworkPolicy(v6);\nreturn v7;', 'NetworkPolicy v6 = new NetworkPolicy(0);\nreturn v6;', 'int v3 = this.mNetworkPolicy.size();\nNetworkPolicy v4 = new NetworkPolicy(v3);\nreturn v4;']
