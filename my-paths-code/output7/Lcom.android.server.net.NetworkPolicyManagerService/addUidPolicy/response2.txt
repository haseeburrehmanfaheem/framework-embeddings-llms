To determine the access control level for the `addUidPolicy` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `addUidPolicy` method appears to be part of a network policy management system. It takes two parameters, `p1` and `p2`, where `p1` seems to represent a user ID (UID) and `p2` represents policies to be added to the existing policies for that UID.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets provided show interactions with `mUidPolicy`, which suggests direct manipulation of user policy settings. This includes getting, setting, or deleting policies for specific UIDs and logging changes to these policies. These operations are sensitive as they can affect how network resources are allocated and restricted for different applications or users.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `removeUidPolicy(II)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that removing policies from a UID is considered a system-level or signature-protected operation, indicating it requires elevated permissions to perform.
   - The similarity in the method names (`addUidPolicy` and `removeUidPolicy`) and their operations (both deal with modifying user policy settings) implies that they might require similar levels of access control. The fact that both can modify policies for UIDs suggests that these operations are not trivial and could impact system security or functionality.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the sensitivity of the operations performed by `addUidPolicy` (modifying network policy settings for a UID), it's reasonable to conclude that this method should have a restrictive access control level.
   - The similarity with `removeUidPolicy`, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, further supports the notion that `addUidPolicy` should also be protected at a similar level.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering the potential impact of modifying user policy settings on system security and functionality, and given the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is logical to assign `addUidPolicy` the same level of access control.

The final answer is: 
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
