Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getSearchablesInGlobalSearch` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getSearchablesInGlobalSearch` method is used to retrieve a list of searchables in the global search. The method checks the user's ID and unlock status before returning the list of searchables. It also updates the searchable list and appends it to the `mSearchables` map.

The similar APIs provided are `getGlobalSearchActivity()` with a similarity score of 0.8935809135437012 and 0.8869578838348389, both with an access control level of NONE. These APIs are related to retrieving the global search activity, which is similar to the purpose of `getSearchablesInGlobalSearch`.

After analyzing the code snippets and sink code provided, I noticed that the `getSearchablesInGlobalSearch` method does not perform any sensitive operations that would require a higher access control level. The method primarily retrieves and updates information related to searchables, which is similar to the functionality of the `getGlobalSearchActivity()` APIs.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I conclude that the `getSearchablesInGlobalSearch` method should have an access control level of NONE.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
