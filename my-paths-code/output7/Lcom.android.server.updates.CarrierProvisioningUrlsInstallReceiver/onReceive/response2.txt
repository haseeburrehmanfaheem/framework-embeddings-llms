To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onReceive` method creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and starts it. This action does not directly imply any dangerous operations such as accessing sensitive user data, modifying system settings, or performing actions that require special permissions.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**: Both similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs have the same code structure as the `onReceive` method in question, involving the creation and starting of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. The high similarity score (1.0) indicates that these methods are nearly identical in terms of functionality and parameters.

3. **Access Control Levels**: 
   - `NONE`: Typically assigned to methods that do not pose a risk or require special permissions.
   - `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, and `SYS_OR_SIG` imply increasing levels of potential risk or the need for specific permissions, which does not seem to apply based on the provided information.

Given the above analysis and considering that both similar APIs have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is logical to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also be assigned the same access control level. The operations within this method do not appear to pose any significant risk or require special permissions based on the provided context.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
