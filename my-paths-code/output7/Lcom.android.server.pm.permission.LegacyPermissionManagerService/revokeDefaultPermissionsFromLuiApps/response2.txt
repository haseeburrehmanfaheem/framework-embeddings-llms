To determine the access control level for the `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` method, we should analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The key aspects to consider are:
1. The method's interaction with sensitive operations (e.g., revoking default permissions).
2. The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` to check the caller's UID, indicating a form of access control.
3. The comparison with similar APIs (`grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps` and `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledTelephonyDataServices`) that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these points:
- The method `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` checks the caller's UID and only proceeds under certain conditions, which suggests it has some form of access restriction.
- The similar APIs (`grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps` and `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledTelephonyDataServices`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. These methods also deal with sensitive permission management operations and use `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`, suggesting they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.
- The code snippet for `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` involves creating a lambda function (`LegacyPermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda4`) and using `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`, which is similar to the patterns seen in the provided similar APIs.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps` should have an access control level consistent with managing sensitive permissions and requiring system or signature-level access to perform its operations.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
