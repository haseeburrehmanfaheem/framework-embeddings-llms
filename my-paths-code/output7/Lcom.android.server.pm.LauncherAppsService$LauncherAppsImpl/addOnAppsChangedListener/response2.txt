To determine the access control level for the `addOnAppsChangedListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `addOnAppsChangedListener` method appears to be registering a listener for app changes. It checks the calling UID and package UID, and if they match, it registers the listener. The sink code shows that it creates a new `LauncherAppsService$BroadcastCookie` object and registers the listener using this cookie.

The similar APIs provided are both `registerWeakEscrowTokenRemovedListener` methods with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also register listeners, but they do not have the same checks for calling UID and package UID as the `addOnAppsChangedListener` method.

However, considering the context of registering a listener and the checks performed in the `addOnAppsChangedListener` method, it seems that this method should have a moderate level of access control. The fact that it checks the calling UID and package UID suggests that it is trying to restrict access to certain packages or UIDs.

Given the options, `SYS_OR_SIG` seems too restrictive for this method, as it does not appear to require system or signature-level permissions. On the other hand, `NONE` seems too permissive, as the method does perform some checks on the calling UID and package UID.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `addOnAppsChangedListener` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
