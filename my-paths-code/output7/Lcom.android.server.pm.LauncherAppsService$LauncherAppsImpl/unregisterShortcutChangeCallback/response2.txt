To determine the access control level for the `unregisterShortcutChangeCallback` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**:
   - The first similar API, `removeListener(Landroid/net/IPacProxyInstalledListener;)V`, has an access control level of `NORMAL`. Its code snippet shows a similar operation (`boolean v3 = this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1);`) which involves unregistering a callback.
   - The second similar API, `unregisterCallback(Landroid/debug/IAdbCallback;)V`, has an access control level of `NONE`. Its code also involves unregistering a callback (`boolean v1 = this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1);`).

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `unregisterShortcutChangeCallback` method's code snippet shows that it unregisters a callback (`boolean v3 = this.mCallbacks.unregister(p2);`) and also interacts with a handler to remove a shortcut change callback (`this.mShortcutChangeHandler.removeShortcutChangeCallback(p2);`).
   - This operation does not seem to involve sensitive user data or dangerous operations that could potentially harm the system or violate user privacy.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose any risk and do not require any special permissions.
   - `NORMAL`: Used for methods that may pose some level of risk but are generally safe and do not require special system-level permissions.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can potentially harm the system, other applications, or user data. These often require explicit user consent via permissions.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for operations that are critical to system functionality or signal handling.

Given these considerations:
- The operation performed by `unregisterShortcutChangeCallback` is not inherently dangerous and seems to follow a pattern similar to the provided APIs, which are either `NORMAL` or `NONE`.
- Unregistering callbacks is generally a safe operation as long as it's properly validated and doesn't expose system vulnerabilities.
- Between the two similar APIs, one has an access control level of `NORMAL` and the other `NONE`, both of which suggest that the operation does not pose significant risk.

Considering the method's functionality and comparing it with the provided similar APIs, **the most appropriate access control level for `unregisterShortcutChangeCallback` would be `NORMAL`**. This choice reflects the method's nature of managing callbacks without indicating a high risk of system compromise or data exposure, aligning more closely with the moderate risk assessment implied by `NORMAL`.
