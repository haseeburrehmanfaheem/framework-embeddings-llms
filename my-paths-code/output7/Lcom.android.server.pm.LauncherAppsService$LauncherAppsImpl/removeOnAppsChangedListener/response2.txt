To assign an access control level to the `removeOnAppsChangedListener` API, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeOnAppsChangedListener` method is responsible for removing a listener that was previously registered to receive notifications about changes in applications. The key parts of this method include:

1. **Unregistering the Listener**: It unregisters the provided listener (`p1`) from `this.mListeners`. This action directly relates to managing callbacks or listeners within the system, which is a common operation but does not inherently imply dangerous or system-level operations by itself.

2. **Conditional Unregistration of Broadcast Receiver and Package Monitor**: After unregistering the listener, it checks if there are any registered callback counts left. If not (i.e., `v2 != 0` condition fails, implying there are still listeners), and under a specific condition (`this.mIsWatchingPackageBroadcasts == 0`), it proceeds to:
   - Unregister a broadcast receiver (`this.mContext.unregisterReceiver(this.mPackageRemovedListener)`).
   - Unregister a package monitor (`this.mPackageMonitor.unregister()`).

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The first part of the sink code (`boolean v1 = this.mListeners.unregister(p1); int v2 = this.mListeners.getRegisteredCallbackCount();`) is directly related to listener management, which is not typically considered a dangerous operation.
   - The second part involves unregistering system-level components (a broadcast receiver and a package monitor), which could have implications on system behavior but does so in response to managing listeners, suggesting it's more about resource cleanup than gaining access to sensitive information or capabilities.
   - The third part (`p0.stopWatchingPackageBroadcasts();`) suggests stopping the observation of package broadcasts, which again is more about listener management and stopping an ongoing operation rather than initiating a dangerous action.

**Comparison with Similar APIs**:

- **unregisterWeakEscrowTokenRemovedListener**: Has a similarity score of 0.8806443214416504 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code primarily involves unregistering a listener, which is similar to the operation in `removeOnAppsChangedListener`. However, the context (weak escrow token removal) might imply system-level security operations.

- **unregisterListener**: With a similarity score of 0.8779634237289429 and an access control level of NORMAL, it simply unregisters a network policy listener without any additional system-level operations like broadcast receiver or package monitor management.

**Conclusion**:
Given the operation of `removeOnAppsChangedListener` involves unregistering listeners and conditionally stopping system-level observations (which seems more related to cleanup than initiating sensitive operations), and comparing with similar APIs, it appears that this method's primary function is listener management. While it does involve some system-level resource management (unregistering a broadcast receiver and package monitor under specific conditions), these actions seem to be part of ensuring the system remains in a consistent state after removing a listener rather than exposing sensitive capabilities or information.

Therefore, considering its operations and comparisons with similar APIs, especially `unregisterListener` which has a NORMAL access control level for essentially the same kind of listener management operation, `removeOnAppsChangedListener` should likely be classified as having an access control level of **NORMAL**. This is because it doesn't seem to expose system capabilities that would necessitate a higher access control level like DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG based on the provided information and comparisons.
