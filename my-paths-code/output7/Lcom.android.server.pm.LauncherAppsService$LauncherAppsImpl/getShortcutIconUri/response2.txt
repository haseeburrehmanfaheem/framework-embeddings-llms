To determine the access control level for the `getShortcutIconUri` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The similar APIs provided are `getShortcutIconResId` with a similarity score of 0.9296398758888245 and 0.9272634983062744, both having an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 
   - These APIs involve checking if the profile can be accessed before retrieving shortcut icon resource IDs, indicating that accessing shortcuts or their icons requires certain permissions or system-level access.

2. **Code Snippets for getShortcutIconUri:**
   - The method involves checks like `if (p1 != v5)`, which compares a provided user ID (`p1`) with the current user ID (`v5`), indicating a check for user profile accessibility.
   - It also includes calls to `injectClearCallingIdentity()` and `injectRestoreCallingIdentity(v12)`, which are related to managing the calling identity, typically used in system services to temporarily change the calling user or process's identity.
   - The presence of `getUserInfo(v5)` suggests that it retrieves information about a specific user, further implying that user-specific data is being accessed.

3. **Sink Code:**
   - The sink code snippets involve getting the calling UID, checking if a profile can be accessed (either directly or through `canAccessProfile` methods), and asynchronous calls to retrieve shortcut icon URIs.
   - These operations are typically sensitive as they deal with user data and require proper authorization.

Given these points:

- The method is similar to others that have been classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies a need for system-level or signature-level permissions due to the nature of accessing user-specific data (shortcut icons).
- The code snippets show checks for user profile accessibility and management of calling identities, indicating an awareness of security and access control.
- The sink code further emphasizes the need for proper authorization when accessing user data.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the similarity with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, the involvement of user profile checks, and the management of calling identities, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getShortcutIconUri` method requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This conclusion is drawn by considering the method's similarity to other system-level or signature-protected APIs and its operations that involve sensitive user data, indicating a need for elevated permissions.
