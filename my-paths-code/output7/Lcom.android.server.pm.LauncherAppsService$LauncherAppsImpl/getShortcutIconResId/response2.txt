Based on the provided information, I will analyze the access control level for the `getShortcutIconResId` API.

The API has three paths with depth 2, and all of them involve checking the calling user's identity and profile accessibility. The sink code also indicates that the API is accessing shortcut icons, which requires proper authorization.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access shortcut icons. The code for these similar APIs also involves checking profile accessibility using the `canAccessProfile` method.

Given the similarities between the `getShortcutIconResId` API and the provided similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for `getShortcutIconResId` should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because accessing shortcut icons requires proper authorization, and the API's implementation involves checking the calling user's identity and profile accessibility.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
