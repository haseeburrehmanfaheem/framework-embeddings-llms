To assign an access control level to the `shareData` API, we must analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs. The provided code snippets for the `shareData` method and the sink code reveal several key aspects:

1. **Input Validation**: The method starts by validating its inputs (`p1` and `p2`) using `Objects.requireNonNull`, ensuring that neither of them is null.
2. **PackageManager Interaction**: It interacts with the `PackageManager` to get packages for a specific UID, which indicates it's dealing with package-level operations or permissions.
3. **User ID Handling**: The method uses `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` to handle user-specific data or services, suggesting it respects user boundaries and possibly operates within a multi-user environment.
4. **Service Interaction**: It creates instances of `ContentCaptureManagerService$DataShareCallbackDelegate` and interacts with remote services like `RemoteContentCaptureService`, indicating communication with system-level services.

The similar APIs provided offer insights into how access control levels are assigned based on method behaviors:

- **removeData**: With an access control level of NONE, this API also deals with remote service scheduling but lacks extensive validation or user-specific handling compared to `shareData`.
- **getContentCaptureConditions**: Also classified as NONE, it involves getting conditions from a service and sending results back. This interaction is more about querying system state rather than modifying it.

Considering the behavior of `shareData`:
- It performs more complex operations involving data sharing across possibly different packages or users.
- The method respects user boundaries by considering the calling user ID.
- It interacts with remote services for scheduling requests, which might imply some level of privilege or access control.

Given these observations and comparing them with the provided similar APIs, `shareData` seems to require a certain level of access control due to its interactions with system services, package-level operations, and respect for user boundaries. However, without explicit evidence of requiring dangerous permissions (like those directly affecting hardware, location, contacts, etc.) or system/signature-level permissions (which typically involve low-level system modifications or sensitive data access), the most appropriate access control level appears to be **NORMAL**.

This choice reflects a balance between the method's need for some access control due to its service interactions and package handling, without escalating to dangerous or signature/system levels which are typically reserved for more sensitive operations.
