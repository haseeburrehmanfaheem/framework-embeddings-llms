To assign an access control level to the `resetTemporaryService` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The provided code snippet for `resetTemporaryService` is:

```java
public void resetTemporaryService(int p1){
    this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);
    return;
}
```

And the sink code is:
```java
['this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);']
```

This method appears to be delegating its call to another instance's `resetTemporaryService` method, passing an integer parameter `p1`. 

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `resetTemporaryService(I)V` with a Similarity Score of 1.0 and Access Control Level: NONE.
   - Its code is essentially the same as the one being analyzed, just confirming the delegation pattern.

2. `setTemporaryService(ILjava/lang/String;I)V` with a Similarity Score of 0.8328460454940796 and Access Control Level: NONE.
   - Although it has a different method name (`setTemporaryService`) and an additional parameter (a `String`), its access control level is also NONE, suggesting that operations related to temporary services might not require strict access controls in this context.

Given the information:

- The method directly delegates its functionality without performing any sensitive operations or checks on its own.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, indicating that these types of operations are likely considered safe or not critical from a security perspective within the application's context.

Therefore, based on the provided code and similar APIs' access control levels, it seems reasonable to assign the `resetTemporaryService` method an access control level of NONE, as it does not seem to perform any sensitive or dangerous operations that would require elevated permissions or stricter controls.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
