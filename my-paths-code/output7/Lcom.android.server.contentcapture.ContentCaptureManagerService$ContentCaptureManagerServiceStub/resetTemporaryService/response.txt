Based on the provided code snippet, here's the analysis:

The method `resetTemporaryService` invokes another method with the same name but on a different object (`this$0`). This invocation has naming similarity with the API name and takes the input parameter `p1` as an argument.

Since this is a single statement that directly contributes to the sink, the JSON output would be:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This instruction follows at least one of the positive rules (naming similarity with the API name and taking the input parameter as an argument). There are no other instructions in this snippet that contribute to a sink.
