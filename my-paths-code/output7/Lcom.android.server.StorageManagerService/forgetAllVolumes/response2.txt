To determine the access control level for the `forgetAllVolumes` method, let's analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Functionality of `forgetAllVolumes`:** This method seems to be responsible for forgetting all volumes, which involves clearing records related to these volumes (`this.mRecords.clear();`), sending messages to notify about forgotten volumes, and potentially updating the primary storage UUID if necessary (`this.mPrimaryStorageUuid = v16;`) followed by writing settings (`p0.writeSettingsLocked();`).

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`setPrimaryStorageUuid(Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/content/pm/IPackageMoveObserver;)V`:** This method has a similarity score of 0.7988835573196411 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It updates the primary storage UUID (`this.mPrimaryStorageUuid = this.mMoveTargetUuid;`) and writes settings (`StorageManagerService.writeSettingsLocked();`). The similarity in functionality, especially regarding updating and writing settings, suggests that both methods interact with system-level storage configurations.
   - **`getPrimaryStorageUuid()Ljava/lang/String;`:** With a similarity score of 0.7796707153320312, this method is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It simply returns the current primary storage UUID (`return this.mPrimaryStorageUuid;`). Although it deals with system configuration, its read-only nature justifies the lower access control level.

3. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   - The `forgetAllVolumes` method directly manipulates system settings by clearing volume records and potentially updating the primary storage UUID, which are critical operations that could impact system functionality and security.
   - Given its ability to modify system-level configurations and considering the similarities with `setPrimaryStorageUuid`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that `forgetAllVolumes` should have a similar or higher level of access control due to its broader impact on system settings.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `forgetAllVolumes` involves significant modifications to system storage configurations, akin to but more extensive than `setPrimaryStorageUuid`, and considering the potential risks associated with such operations (e.g., data loss, security vulnerabilities), it should be assigned an access control level that reflects its potential impact.

**Final Access Control Level:**
Given the analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `forgetAllVolumes` method is `SYS_OR_SIG` because it modifies system settings and has a significant impact on storage configurations, similar to `setPrimaryStorageUuid`, but with broader implications due to its operation on all volumes.
