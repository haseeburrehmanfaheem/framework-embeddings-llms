To determine the access control level for the `mkdirs` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `mkdirs` method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `PackageManager`: It uses the `getPackageManager()` method to get an instance of `PackageManager`, and then calls `getProperty()` on it.
2. `File`: It creates a new `File` object using the provided path.
3. `Matcher`: It uses a `Matcher` object to match the path against a pattern.

The similar APIs provided, `isChangeEnabledByUid(JI)Z`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `PackageManager` and use its methods to get information about packages and UIDs.

However, the `mkdirs` method does not seem to be performing any sensitive operations that would require a high level of access control. It appears to be creating directories and checking their paths, which is a relatively benign operation.

Considering the similarities with the provided APIs and the nature of the `mkdirs` method's operations, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the `mkdirs` method does not seem to be performing any highly sensitive or privileged operations, and its interactions with the `PackageManager` and `File` objects are relatively limited. However, it's worth noting that a more detailed analysis of the method's context and potential use cases might lead to a different conclusion.
