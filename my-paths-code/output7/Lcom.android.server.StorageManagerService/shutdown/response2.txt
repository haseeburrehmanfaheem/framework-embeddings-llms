Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `shutdown` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `shutdown` method has a similarity score of 1.0000001192092896 with the `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippets for both methods are almost identical, with the only difference being the message ID passed to `obtainMessage`.

The `shutdown` method also has a similarity score of 0.9896624088287354 with the `registerStrongAuthTracker` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Again, the code snippets are similar, with the main difference being the message ID.

Given the high similarity scores and identical code structures, it is reasonable to conclude that the `shutdown` method should have the same access control level as its similar APIs, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
