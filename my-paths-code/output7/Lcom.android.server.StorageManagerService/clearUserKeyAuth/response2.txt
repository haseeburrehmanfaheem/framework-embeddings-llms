To assign an access control level to the `clearUserKeyAuth` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `clearUserKeyAuth` method has two paths:

1. In the first path, it checks if the input byte array `p3` is empty using `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(p3)`. If it's not empty, it converts the byte array to a hexadecimal string using `HexDump.toHexString(p3)` and then calls `this.mVold.clearUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)` with the converted string.
2. In the second path, if the input byte array `p3` is empty, it sets a default string `"!"` and calls `this.mVold.clearUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)` with this default string.

The sink code shows that the method interacts with `this.mVold.clearUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)`, which is similar to the sink code in the similar APIs.

The similar APIs are:

* `addUserKeyAuth(II[B)V` with a similarity score of 0.9470919370651245 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `addUserKeyAuth(II[B)V` with a similarity score of 0.9467577934265137 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have the same access control level, `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to execute.

Given the similarities between the `clearUserKeyAuth` method and the similar APIs, it's likely that the `clearUserKeyAuth` method also requires system or signature-level permission to execute. Therefore, the assigned access control level for the `clearUserKeyAuth` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities in code structure and sink interactions between the `clearUserKeyAuth` method and the similar APIs, as well as the requirement for system or signature-level permission to execute the similar APIs.
