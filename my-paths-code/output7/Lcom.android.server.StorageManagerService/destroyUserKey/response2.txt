To determine the access control level for the `destroyUserKey` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the `destroyUserKey` method itself.

The two similar APIs provided are:
1. `destroyUserStorage(Ljava/lang/String;II)V` with a similarity score of 0.8102518320083618 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `createUserKey(IIZ)V` with a similarity score of 0.7811010479927063 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to execute, suggesting that these operations are sensitive and should be restricted.

The `destroyUserKey` method, with its similarity in functionality (as implied by the high similarity scores) to these APIs, likely involves a similar level of sensitivity. The operation of destroying a user key implies modification or removal of security-related data, which typically requires elevated permissions to prevent unauthorized access or changes.

Given this analysis and the fact that both provided similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `destroyUserKey` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to ensure that such sensitive operations are properly secured.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `destroyUserKey` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
