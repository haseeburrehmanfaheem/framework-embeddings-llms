Based on the provided code, here's the analysis:

The method `startCheckpoint` invokes another method `this.mVold.startCheckpoint(p1)` with high naming similarity and uses the input parameter `p1`. 

Here is the JSON output:
```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "this.mVold.startCheckpoint(p1);",
        "return;"
    ]
]
}
```
However, since the return statement does not contribute to a sink (as per negative rules), it can be excluded from the sinks list.

Here is the updated JSON output:
```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "this.mVold.startCheckpoint(p1);"
    ]
]
}
```
