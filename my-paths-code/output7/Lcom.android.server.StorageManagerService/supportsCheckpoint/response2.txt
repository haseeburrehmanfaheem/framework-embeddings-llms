To determine the access control level for the `supportsCheckpoint` method, we'll examine its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis of `supportsCheckpoint`:**
   - The method directly calls `this.mVold.supportsCheckpoint()` and returns the result. This implies that it's essentially a wrapper around the `mVold` object's `supportsCheckpoint` method.
   - There are no conditional checks, permissions verifications, or any form of access control within this method itself.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - The `needsCheckpoint()` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to checkpointing are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.
   - The `fstrim` API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, further reinforcing the idea that methods interacting with the `mVold` object, especially in the context of checkpointing or file system trimming, are subject to stricter access controls.

3. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   - Given the similarity in functionality and the fact that both similar APIs (`needsCheckpoint` and `fstrim`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to infer that `supportsCheckpoint` should also be assigned a similar access control level.
   - The method's simplicity as a wrapper does not diminish the sensitivity of the operation it wraps. Thus, it should inherit the same level of access control as the operations it facilitates.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs that interact with the `mVold` object for checkpointing-related functionalities, the `supportsCheckpoint` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
