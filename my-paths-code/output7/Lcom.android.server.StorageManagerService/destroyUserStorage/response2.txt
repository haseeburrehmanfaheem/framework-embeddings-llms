To determine the access control level for the `destroyUserStorage` method, we should analyze its similarities with other provided APIs and their assigned access control levels. The two similar APIs are `destroyUserKey` and `prepareUserStorage`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

1. **Similarity with destroyUserKey**: This API has a high similarity score (0.8102518320083618) with `destroyUserStorage`. It interacts with `this.mVold.destroyUserKey(p1);`, suggesting that operations related to user storage and key management are restricted to system or signature level access due to their sensitive nature.

2. **Similarity with prepareUserStorage**: This API also has a high similarity score (0.8085793256759644) with `destroyUserStorage`. It involves preparing user storage, which is a critical operation that likely requires elevated permissions to ensure data integrity and security.

Given these similarities and the operations involved (destroying user storage), it's reasonable to infer that `destroyUserStorage` also deals with sensitive data or system-level functionality. Thus, it should be restricted to either system-level access or signature-level access to prevent unauthorized manipulation of user storage.

**Access Control Decision**: Considering the high similarity scores with APIs that have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels and the nature of the operation (destroying user storage), the most appropriate access control level for `destroyUserStorage` is also `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized system components or applications signed with the platform key can perform such sensitive operations.
