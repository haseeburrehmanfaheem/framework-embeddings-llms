To determine the access control level for the `getMountedObbPath` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - Both similar APIs (`setPrimaryStorageUuid`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to volume management and storage paths are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   - The sink code involves retrieving a volume by its ID, getting the path of that volume, and returning the absolute path as a string. This operation is about accessing and manipulating storage-related information.
   - Given that it deals with storage paths and volumes, this could be considered sensitive information that should not be freely accessible to all applications.

3. **Access Control Level Choices:**
   - `NONE`: Implies no specific access control is required. Given the sensitivity of storage management, this seems unlikely.
   - `NORMAL`: Suggests a standard level of access control but does not imply system-level permissions are necessary. This might be too permissive given the nature of the operation.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Indicates that the operation could potentially harm the user's data or the device. While getting a mounted OBB path might not directly cause harm, it involves accessing storage information which could be considered sensitive.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Requires either system-level permissions or signature-level access (i.e., the app must be signed with the same certificate as the platform or have specific system-level grants). Given that similar APIs are classified under this level and considering the sensitivity of storage operations, this seems like a plausible choice.

Given these considerations, especially noting that both similar APIs (`setPrimaryStorageUuid`) require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control and the nature of the operation involves accessing sensitive storage information, it's reasonable to conclude that `getMountedObbPath` should also have a similar level of protection.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This choice reflects the need for either system-level or signature-level access to perform operations that involve sensitive storage management tasks, aligning with the principles demonstrated by the similar APIs and considering the potential implications of such operations on device security and user data privacy.
