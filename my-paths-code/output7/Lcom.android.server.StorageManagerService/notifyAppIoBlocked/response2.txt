To assign an access control level to the `notifyAppIoBlocked` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `notifyAppIoBlocked` method enforces external storage service using `p0.enforceExternalStorageService();`, which suggests that it is interacting with sensitive storage operations. The method then checks if a connection exists for a given user ID, and if not, it updates the `mUidsBlockedOnIo` map to keep track of blocked I/O operations.

The sink code shows two possible paths:

1. Updating the `mUidsBlockedOnIo` map when no connection exists.
2. Notifying an app of I/O blockage through the `notifyAppIoBlocked` method on the `v4` object (which represents a connection).
3. Notifying the storage session controller of I/O blockage.

The similar APIs, `notifyAppIoResumed`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with storage operations and notify apps or the storage session controller about I/O resumption.

Considering the similarities between `notifyAppIoBlocked` and `notifyAppIoResumed`, it is likely that `notifyAppIoBlocked` requires a similar access control level. Since both methods are related to sensitive storage operations and notification of apps, they should have a consistent access control level.

Based on this analysis, I would assign the following access control level to the `notifyAppIoBlocked` method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-protected apps can invoke this method, which is consistent with the similar APIs and the sensitive nature of storage operations.
