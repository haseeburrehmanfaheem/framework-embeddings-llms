To determine the access control level for the `format(String p1)` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The given method interacts with the `mVold` object to format a volume, removes records from `mRecords`, and notifies about forgotten volumes. It also updates the primary storage UUID under certain conditions and writes settings to a file.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. **mount(Ljava/lang/String;)V**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves getting a volume by its ID and interacting with system services, indicating that it requires either system or signature-level permissions due to its potential impact on the system's state.

2. **setPrimaryStorageUuid(Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/content/pm/IPackageMoveObserver;)V**: This method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves finding volumes by UUID, constructing new volume IDs, and potentially updating the primary storage UUID, which is a significant system operation affecting storage configuration.

Given these comparisons, the `format(String p1)` method appears to perform operations that are at least as sensitive as those in the similar APIs. The method directly impacts storage (by formatting a volume), updates system settings (like the primary storage UUID), and interacts with system-level components (`mVold`, `SystemProperties`). These actions suggest that it requires protection against unauthorized access to prevent data loss or system configuration changes without proper authorization.

Therefore, considering the potential impact of this method on system integrity and user data, the most appropriate access control level would be **DANGEROUS**. This level reflects the need for caution and proper permission handling when invoking such a method, given its capability to alter significant aspects of the device's storage configuration.
