To determine the access control level for the `releaseLease` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The `releaseLease` method appears to be part of a blob management system, where it releases a lease on a blob handle. The method performs several checks, including validating input parameters, checking if the label or tag is too long, verifying if the calling app is an instant app, and ensuring that the caller has access to the blob.

The sink code provided suggests that this method interacts with sensitive operations such as posting delayed tasks for deletion and removing leasees from blobs. These operations could potentially impact system security or user data privacy if not properly controlled.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:
- Both `acquireLease` methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that acquiring a lease, which is essentially the opposite operation of releasing one, requires either system-level permissions or a signature matching the app that owns the blob. This makes sense because both acquiring and releasing leases are critical operations that should be restricted to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

Given these considerations:
- The `releaseLease` method involves sensitive operations similar to those in `acquireLease`.
- It requires validation of the caller's identity and checks for permissions, indicating a need for controlled access.
- The similarity with `acquireLease` methods, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, implies that `releaseLease` should also be protected against unauthorized calls.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `releaseLease` method should have a similar level of protection to prevent misuse or unauthorized access.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }}$
