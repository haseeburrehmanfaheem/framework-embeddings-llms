To determine the access control level for the `getLeaseInfo` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs provided.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getLeaseInfo` method involves several checks such as null checks on parameters (`p1`, `p2`), validation of algorithm support, non-empty byte array check (`digest`), and string length checks for `label` and `tag`. It also involves calls to other methods like `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the UID of the calling process and `isInstantApp` to check if an app is an instant app. These operations suggest that the method interacts with sensitive data and system-level information.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets indicate how the `getLeaseInfo` method is called internally, involving calls like `BlobStoreManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetLeaseInfoInternal`. This suggests internal handling of lease information, which could be related to managing access or permissions to certain data or resources.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `releaseLease` API has a high similarity score and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method likely releases a lease on a blob, which implies managing system-level permissions or access controls.
   - The `acquireLease` API also has a high similarity score with `getLeaseInfo` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Acquiring a lease suggests obtaining temporary permission to access certain data, which involves system-level access control.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs (`releaseLease` and `acquireLease`) have `SYS_OR_SIG` as their access control levels. This indicates that they are involved in system-level operations related to managing leases on blobs, which likely require signature or system-level permissions.
- The `getLeaseInfo` method involves checks that suggest it is also dealing with sensitive information and system-level interactions (e.g., checking if an app is instant, getting the calling UID).
- The internal calls within `getLeaseInfo` to methods like `getLeaseInfoInternal` further imply handling of lease information at a level that requires careful access control.

Based on these considerations, it's reasonable to conclude that `getLeaseInfo` should have an access control level similar to its similar APIs, especially since it seems to be involved in managing or querying leases which could impact system security or app permissions.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getLeaseInfo` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the method's involvement in potentially sensitive operations related to lease management and its similarity to other methods that require system or signature-level permissions.
