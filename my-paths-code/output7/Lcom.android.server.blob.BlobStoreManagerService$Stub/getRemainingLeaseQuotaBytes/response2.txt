To determine the access control level for the `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` method has a similarity score of over 0.8 with two instances of the `releaseAllLeases` method, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This high similarity suggests that `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` likely requires a similar level of access control.

Looking at the code snippet for `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes`, we see that it involves:

1. Checking the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()`.
2. Interacting with `BlobStoreConfig` and `BlobStoreManagerService` to retrieve and calculate quota bytes.

The similar APIs, `releaseAllLeases`, also involve checking the calling UID and verifying package access before performing operations related to blob store management. The fact that they are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG` implies that these operations are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permission.

Given this information, we can infer that the `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` method, which deals with sensitive data like quota bytes and interacts with similar components, would also require a significant level of access control. However, since it's more about retrieving information rather than performing a critical operation like releasing leases, its access control might not be as restrictive as `SYS_OR_SIG` but still significant.

Considering the options provided:

- `NONE`: This seems too permissive given the method's interaction with potentially sensitive data.
- `NORMAL`: This could be a reasonable choice if we consider that getting remaining lease quota bytes might not be as critical as releasing leases, but it still involves checking the caller's UID and accessing specific app data limits.
- `DANGEROUS`: This seems too restrictive for a method that is primarily informational and does not directly modify system state in a dangerous way.
- `SYS_OR_SIG`: Given the similarities with `releaseAllLeases` and the involvement of sensitive operations, this could be a valid choice. However, the method's nature (retrieval of information) might suggest it doesn't require system or signature-level access.

Given these considerations, and without explicit calls to verify package access or check for allowed blob store access as seen in the similar APIs, but still recognizing the need for some level of access control due to the method's similarity to `SYS_OR_SIG` classified methods and its handling of potentially sensitive data:

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
