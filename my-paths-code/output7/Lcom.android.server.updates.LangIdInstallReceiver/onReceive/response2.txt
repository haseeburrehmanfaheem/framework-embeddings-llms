To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The given `onReceive` method has the following characteristics:
- It takes a `Context` and an `Intent` as parameters.
- It creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor, and then starts it.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:
- Both have a similarity score of 1.0 with the `onReceive` method in question.
- Both are also named `onReceive(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/content/Intent;)V`.
- Both have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The code snippets for these similar APIs are virtually identical to the one provided for the method in question, involving the creation and start of a `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` instance.

Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and their functionality is nearly identical to the `onReceive` method we're analyzing (involving the same parameters and operations), it suggests that the `onReceive` method does not perform any actions that would require elevated permissions or pose significant risks to the system or user data.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons with similar APIs, the access control level for the `onReceive` method should also be `NONE`.

{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
