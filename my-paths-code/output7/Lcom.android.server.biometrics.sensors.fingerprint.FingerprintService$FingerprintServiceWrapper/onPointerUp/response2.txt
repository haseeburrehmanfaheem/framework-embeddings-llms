Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `onPointerUp` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `onPointerUp` method interacts with the `ServiceProvider` class, which is also present in the similar APIs (`revokeChallenge` and `createTestSession`). The sink code snippets suggest that the `onPointerUp` method may be accessing sensitive data or functionality related to fingerprint sensors.

The similar API `revokeChallenge` has an access control level of `NORMAL`, and its code snippet shows a direct assignment of a `ServiceProvider` instance using the `getProviderForSensor` method. This suggests that the `NORMAL` access control level is suitable for APIs that interact with `ServiceProvider` instances in a similar manner.

The other similar API, `createTestSession`, also has an access control level of `NORMAL`, and its code snippet shows a assignment of a `ServiceProvider` instance using a nested method call. Although the code structure is slightly different, the interaction with the `ServiceProvider` class is still present.

Considering the similarities between the `onPointerUp` method and the provided APIs, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `onPointerUp` method. This is because the method interacts with the `ServiceProvider` class in a way that is consistent with the similar APIs, which have already been assigned a `NORMAL` access control level.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
