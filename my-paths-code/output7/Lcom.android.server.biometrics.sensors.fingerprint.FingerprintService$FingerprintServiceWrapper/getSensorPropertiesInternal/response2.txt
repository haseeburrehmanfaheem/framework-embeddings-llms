To assign an access control level to the `getSensorPropertiesInternal` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs with their assigned access control levels.

The provided code snippet for `getSensorPropertiesInternal` is:
```java
public List getSensorPropertiesInternal(String p1){
    List v6 = this.mSensorProps;
    List v5 = v6;
    return v5;
}
```
This method appears to be returning a list of sensor properties, which seems like a relatively benign operation.

The sink code provided also shows similar operations of retrieving and returning lists related to sensor properties:
```java
['List v6 = this.this$0.getSensorProperties();\nList v5 = v6;\nreturn v5;', 
 'List v5 = FingerprintService.-$$Nest$mgetSensorProperties(this.this$0);\nreturn v5;', 
 'List v6 = this.mSensorProps;\nList v5 = v6;\nreturn v5;']
```
These operations do not seem to involve sensitive data or dangerous actions that could compromise the system's security.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:
1. The first API has a similarity score of 0.9813703298568726 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code is:
```java
List v6 = this.this$0.getSensorProperties();
List v5 = v6;
return v5;
```
2. The second API has a similarity score of 0.8893499374389648, also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and its code is:
```java
List v6 = this.mSensorProps;
List v5 = v6;
return v5;
```
Both similar APIs have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, which suggests that they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. This could be because accessing sensor properties might require specific permissions to ensure that only authorized components can retrieve such information.

Given the similarity in operations and the context provided by the sink code and similar APIs, it seems reasonable to conclude that `getSensorPropertiesInternal` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method's operation of returning sensor properties aligns with the need for system or signature-level permissions to protect access to potentially sensitive device information.

Therefore, based on the provided analysis:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
