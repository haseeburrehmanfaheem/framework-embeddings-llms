To determine the access control level for the `removeAll` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

1. **Code Analysis of `removeAll`:**
   - The method iterates through a list of service providers (`mServiceProviders`) and for each provider, it attempts to remove all fingerprints associated with a given sensor ID.
   - It creates an instance of `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper$2`, which seems to be a callback or receiver for the removal operation.
   - The actual removal is performed by calling `scheduleRemoveAll` on a sensor object, passing in necessary parameters including the sensor ID, binder, callback, and other identifiers.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **API Name: `remove`:** This API has a similarity score of 0.8298537731170654 with `removeAll`. It also interacts with sensor properties but seems to remove a single item instead of all. Its access control level is NORMAL.
   - **API Name: `removeAll` (for FaceService):** With a similarity score of 0.8150778412818909, this API is quite similar in structure and purpose to the `removeAll` method under consideration but applies to face recognition instead of fingerprints. Its access control level is also NORMAL.

3. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of NORMAL, it suggests that operations related to removing biometric data (whether fingerprints or facial recognition data) are considered to require a moderate level of access control.
   - The `removeAll` method's functionality is closely aligned with these examples, as it also deals with the removal of sensitive user data (fingerprint templates).
   - Therefore, based on the similarity in purpose and functionality with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of NORMAL, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeAll` method should also be assigned an access control level of NORMAL.

**Access Control Level for `removeAll`:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This determination reflects the method's involvement in managing sensitive user data and its similarity to other APIs with established access control levels.
