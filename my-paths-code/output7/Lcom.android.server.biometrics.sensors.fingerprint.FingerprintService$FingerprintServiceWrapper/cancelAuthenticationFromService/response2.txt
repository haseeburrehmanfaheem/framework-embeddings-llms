To determine the access control level for the `cancelAuthenticationFromService` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `cancelAuthenticationFromService` method has three code paths, but all of them involve iterating over a list of service providers (`this.mServiceProviders`) and checking if any provider contains a specific sensor. If a provider is found, it calls the `cancelAuthentication` method on that provider in one of the paths.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. **startPreparedClient(II)V**: This API has an access control level of NORMAL. Its code snippet shows that it retrieves a service provider for a specific sensor using `getProviderForSensor(p1)` and then checks if the provider is not null before returning.

2. The second instance of **startPreparedClient(II)V** also has an access control level of NORMAL, with a similar logic but uses `FaceService.-$$Nest$mgetProviderForSensor(this.this$0, p1)` to get the service provider.

Given these comparisons:

- All APIs interact with service providers and sensors.
- The logic involves checking for the existence or nullity of a service provider before proceeding with an action (either returning immediately or performing another operation like canceling authentication).
- None of the provided code snippets directly indicate operations that would typically be classified as DANGEROUS (e.g., accessing sensitive data without permission, performing operations that could compromise system security) based on the information given.
- The operation of canceling authentication from a service seems to imply a level of control or management over authentication processes, which does not inherently suggest a need for the highest access control levels like SYS_OR_SIG without more context indicating it directly impacts system integrity or requires signature-level permissions.

Given these points and considering the similarity in logic and operations with the provided APIs (which are classified as NORMAL), it's reasonable to conclude that the `cancelAuthenticationFromService` method should also have an access control level of NORMAL. This is because it does not seem to perform any actions that would typically be categorized under higher risk or system-critical operations without explicit indication otherwise.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
