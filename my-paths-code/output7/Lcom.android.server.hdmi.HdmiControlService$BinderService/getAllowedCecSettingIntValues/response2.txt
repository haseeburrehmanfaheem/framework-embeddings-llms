Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method interacts with the `HdmiCecConfig` class, which is also used by the similar APIs. The method retrieves allowed integer values for a specific CEC setting and returns them as an array.

Comparing this method with its similar APIs:

1. `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8787634372711182 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves allowed string values for a CEC setting, which is similar to the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method, but returns a list of strings instead of integers.
2. `getCecSettingIntValue`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8675972819328308 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves the integer value of a CEC setting, which is related to the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method, but returns a single integer value instead of an array.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, it can be inferred that the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because all three methods interact with the `HdmiCecConfig` class and are related to CEC settings, which suggests that they require similar access controls.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, the final access control level for the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
