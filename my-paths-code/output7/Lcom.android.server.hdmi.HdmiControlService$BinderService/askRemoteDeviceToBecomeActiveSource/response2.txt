To determine the access control level for the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `powerOffRemoteDevice(II)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method involves creating a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11` and then running it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`.
   - The sink code snippets all involve creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11` (or similar) and either posting it to a handler or running it on the service thread.

3. **Access Control Level Considerations:**
   - `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically implies that the method requires system or signature-level permissions to be invoked, suggesting that it interacts with sensitive operations or data.
   - The high similarity scores between `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` and the other two methods (`powerOnRemoteDevice` and `powerOffRemoteDevice`) indicate that these methods likely perform related functions within the HDMI control service.

Given these points, since `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` is closely related to `powerOnRemoteDevice` and `powerOffRemoteDevice`, both of which have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to infer that `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` also requires a similar level of access control due to its likely interaction with system-level HDMI control operations.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
