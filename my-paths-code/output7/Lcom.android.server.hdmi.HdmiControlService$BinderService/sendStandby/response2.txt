To determine the access control level for the `sendStandby` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `sendStandby` method has a similarity score of 0.9976672530174255 with the `setSystemAudioMode` API and 0.9965601563453674 with the `powerOnRemoteDevice` API, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The code snippets of these similar APIs involve posting a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler, which is not present in the `sendStandby` method. However, they all seem to be interacting with the `HdmiControlService` and are using a similar pattern of creating a new instance of a class (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$16`, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$8`, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10`) and then running it on a service thread or posting it to a handler.

Given the high similarity scores with the other APIs, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `sendStandby` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method appears to be performing a similar operation (interacting with the `HdmiControlService`) and has a similar structure to the other APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippets and the similarity scores, the final access control level for the `sendStandby` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
