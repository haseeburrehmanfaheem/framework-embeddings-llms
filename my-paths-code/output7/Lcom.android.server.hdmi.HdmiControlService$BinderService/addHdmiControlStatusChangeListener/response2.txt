Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method.

The method has a similarity score of 0.9288846254348755 with the `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` API and 0.9114876389503479 with the `addDeviceEventListener` API, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippets for these similar APIs also show a similar pattern of creating a listener record and linking it to death using the `IBinder`.

The sink code for `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` also shows a similar pattern:

* Creating a `HdmiControlService$HdmiControlStatusChangeListenerRecord` object
* Getting the `IBinder` from the listener interface
* Linking the `IBinder` to death using the `linkToDeath` method

Given this information, it is likely that the `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method requires a similar access control level as the other two APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This is because the method seems to be interacting with system-level services and requires a signature or system-level permission to access the HDMI control status change listener.
