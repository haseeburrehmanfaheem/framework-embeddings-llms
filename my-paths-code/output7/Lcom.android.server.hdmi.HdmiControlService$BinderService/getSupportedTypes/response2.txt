Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getSupportedTypes` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getSupportedTypes` method interacts with the `HdmiControlService` and `mLocalDevices` list, which seems to be related to HDMI control and device management. The method retrieves the size of the `mLocalDevices` list and creates an array based on that size.

The similar APIs, `canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the `HdmiControlService` and `mLocalDevices` list, and they seem to be related to system audio mode management.

Considering the similarities between the `getSupportedTypes` method and the `canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z` APIs, it is likely that the `getSupportedTypes` method requires a similar access control level. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that the method may require system or signature-level permissions to access the HDMI control service and device list.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getSupportedTypes` method.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
