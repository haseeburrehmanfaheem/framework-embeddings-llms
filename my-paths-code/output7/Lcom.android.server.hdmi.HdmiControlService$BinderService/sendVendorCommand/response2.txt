To determine the access control level for the `sendVendorCommand` API, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `sendVendorCommand` method creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15`, passing parameters to it, and then runs this instance on a service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`. This operation involves internal service handling and does not directly interact with external resources that could pose a significant security risk.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink codes provided show similar patterns of creating a runnable (in this case, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15`) and posting it to a handler or running it on a service thread. This pattern suggests internal handling within the service without direct access to sensitive user data or system resources that could be dangerous.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **clearTimerRecording(II[B)V**: This API has a high similarity score with `sendVendorCommand` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet involves posting a runnable to a handler, similar to the pattern observed in the sink codes for `sendVendorCommand`.
   - **setSystemAudioVolume(III)V**: Also with a high similarity score, this API is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` and follows a comparable execution path by posting a runnable to a handler.

Given these observations:
- The operations within `sendVendorCommand` and its similar APIs seem to be related to internal service management or system-level adjustments (like setting audio volume or clearing timer recordings), which do not directly expose sensitive user data but may require system or signature level permissions due to their nature of interacting with system services.
- The high similarity scores with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels suggest that `sendVendorCommand` likely requires similar privileges.

**Conclusion**: Based on the code patterns, the nature of operations, and the similarities with other APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `sendVendorCommand` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it appears to interact with system-level functionalities in a manner consistent with the need for such permissions.
