To determine the access control level for the `getInputDevices` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getInputDevices` method retrieves a list of input devices. It interacts with `HdmiCecNetwork` to get safe external inputs and merges them with MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) devices. This operation seems to be related to managing or querying the state of HDMI devices connected to an Android device, which is typically a system-level functionality.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets provided show interactions with `HdmiCecNetwork` and the merging of different lists of devices (safe external inputs and MHL devices). These operations are consistent with system-level management tasks, particularly those related to HDMI and device connectivity.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getActiveSource()Landroid/hardware/hdmi/HdmiDeviceInfo;`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that they require either system or signature-level permissions, indicating their involvement in sensitive system operations.
   - The similarity scores (0.754857063293457 and 0.7418355345726013) are relatively high, implying that the `getInputDevices` method shares significant functionality or operational characteristics with these APIs.

Given this analysis, we can infer the following:
- The `getInputDevices` method is involved in system-level operations related to managing HDMI devices.
- It interacts with components (`HdmiCecNetwork`, MHL devices) that are typically managed at a system level.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, suggesting they require elevated permissions for their operation.

**Conclusion**: Based on the operational characteristics of the `getInputDevices` method and its similarities to other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also be assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This reflects its involvement in system-level operations that likely require either system or signature permissions.
