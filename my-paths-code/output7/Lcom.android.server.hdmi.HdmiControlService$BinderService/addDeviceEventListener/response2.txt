Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addDeviceEventListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `addDeviceEventListener` method has two paths with similar code snippets, both of which create a new `HdmiControlService$DeviceEventListenerRecord` object and link it to the death of an `IBinder` object. This is similar to the code patterns observed in the provided similar APIs, `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` and `addVendorCommandListener`, which also create record objects and link them to the death of an `IBinder` object.

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to access. Given the similarity in code patterns and the fact that all three methods appear to be related to HDMI device event listening, it is reasonable to conclude that the `addDeviceEventListener` method should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, the final access control level for the `addDeviceEventListener` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
