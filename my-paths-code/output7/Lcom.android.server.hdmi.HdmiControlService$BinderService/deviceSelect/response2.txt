To assign an access control level to the `deviceSelect` API, we must consider its similarity to other APIs and their respective access control levels. 

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `portSelect(ILandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` with a similarity score of 0.99867182970047 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `setSystemAudioMode(ZLandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` with a similarity score of 0.9977911114692688 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to be executed. The high similarity scores suggest that the `deviceSelect` API shares similar functionality or characteristics with these APIs.

Given this information, it's reasonable to infer that the `deviceSelect` API would also require a similar level of access control due to its similarities in code structure and potential functionality with the provided APIs.

Therefore, based on the high similarity scores and the access control levels of the comparable APIs, the final access control level for the `deviceSelect` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is made considering the semantic similarities between the APIs and the principle that similar functionalities often require similar levels of access control to maintain consistency in security policies.
