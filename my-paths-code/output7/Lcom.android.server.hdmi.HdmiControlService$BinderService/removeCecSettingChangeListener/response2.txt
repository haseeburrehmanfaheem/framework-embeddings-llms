To determine the access control level for the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method, we should consider the semantics of this API and its interaction with the system, as well as compare it to similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippet for `removeCecSettingChangeListener` shows that it is involved in managing listener records for HDMI CEC setting changes. The method checks if a listener is registered and, if so, attempts to unregister it. This operation does not directly interact with sensitive user data or dangerous operations like sending SMS, making calls, or accessing fine location. However, it does involve system-level functionality related to HDMI control, which might require certain privileges.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:
- `addCecSettingChangeListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that adding a listener for CEC setting changes requires either system or signature-level permission, indicating that this operation is somewhat restricted due to its interaction with system-level functionality.

Given the similarity in purpose and functionality between `removeCecSettingChangeListener` and `addCecSettingChangeListener`, it's reasonable to infer that removing a listener would also require a similar level of access control. Both operations are related to managing callbacks for system-level events (HDMI CEC setting changes), which suggests they should be treated similarly from a security perspective.

The sink code provided also shows interactions with `HdmiControlService`, further indicating that this method is involved in system-level operations related to HDMI control.

Considering these points, the access control level for `removeCecSettingChangeListener` should be consistent with that of its similar API, `addCecSettingChangeListener`, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that both adding and removing listeners for CEC setting changes are treated with the same level of security scrutiny due to their system-level nature.

Therefore, the access control level for the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
