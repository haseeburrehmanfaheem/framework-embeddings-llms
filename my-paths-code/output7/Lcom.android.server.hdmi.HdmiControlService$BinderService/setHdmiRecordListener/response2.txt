Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `setHdmiRecordListener` method. The method has two paths with similar code snippets, and it interacts with a sink that is similar to the sinks in the provided similar APIs.

The similar APIs, `setInputChangeListener` and `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with similar sinks, where they create a new record object and link it to the death of an `IBinder` object.

Given the similarity in code snippets and sink interactions between the `setHdmiRecordListener` method and the provided similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `setHdmiRecordListener` method should be the same as the similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `setHdmiRecordListener` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This conclusion is based on the similarity in code structure and sink interactions between the `setHdmiRecordListener` method and the provided similar APIs, which suggests that the access control level should be consistent across these similar methods.
