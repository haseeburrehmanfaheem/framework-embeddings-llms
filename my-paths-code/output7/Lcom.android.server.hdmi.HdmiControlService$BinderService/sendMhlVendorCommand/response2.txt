To determine the access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `sendMhlVendorCommand` method interacts with the `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21` class, which is then passed to `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`. This suggests that the API is performing some operation related to HDMI control services.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `startOneTouchRecord(I[B)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows a similar pattern of creating a runnable (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$17`) and posting it to a handler.
2. `reportAudioStatus(IIIZ)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It follows a similar approach by creating a runnable (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$23`) and posting it to a handler.

Both of these APIs have a high similarity score with `sendMhlVendorCommand`, indicating that they share similar functionality or implementation details. Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that `sendMhlVendorCommand` might require a similar level of access control due to its interaction with system-level services (HDMI control) and the way it handles threads.

Considering these points, the access control level for `sendMhlVendorCommand` should likely be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it appears to involve system-level operations similar to the provided APIs.
