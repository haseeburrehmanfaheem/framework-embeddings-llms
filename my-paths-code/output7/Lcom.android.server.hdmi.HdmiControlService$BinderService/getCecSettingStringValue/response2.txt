Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getCecSettingStringValue` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getCecSettingStringValue` method appears to be retrieving a string value from the HDMI CEC configuration settings. The method has three different paths, each reading from a different storage type: shared preference, global setting, and system property.

The similar APIs provided, `getCecSettingIntValue`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also retrieving values from the HDMI CEC configuration settings, but they are returning integer values instead of string values.

Considering the similarity in functionality and the fact that these methods are accessing sensitive configuration settings, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `getCecSettingStringValue` method.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getCecSettingStringValue` method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
