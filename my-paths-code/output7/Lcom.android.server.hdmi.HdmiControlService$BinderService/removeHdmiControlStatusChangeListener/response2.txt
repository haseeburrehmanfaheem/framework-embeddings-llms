Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method appears to be removing a listener from a list of listener records. The method iterates over the list, checks if the listener matches the one being removed, and if so, unlinks it from death and removes it from the list.

The similar APIs, `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also remove listeners from lists, but they seem to be related to system audio modes. The code snippets provided for these methods show similarities with the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method, such as iterating over a list of listener records and removing the matching listener.

Given the similarities between these methods and their access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because all these methods seem to be related to removing listeners from lists, which might require system or signature-level permissions to perform.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
