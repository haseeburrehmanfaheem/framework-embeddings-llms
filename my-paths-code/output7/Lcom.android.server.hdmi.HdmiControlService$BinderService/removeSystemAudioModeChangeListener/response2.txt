To determine the access control level for the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Similar APIs**:
   - `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`: This API has a high similarity score (0.9019820690155029) with the method in question and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`: Although this method adds a listener rather than removing one, it also interacts closely with system audio mode change listeners and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its similarity score to our method is also high (0.9018630981445312).

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The provided code snippet for `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` involves iterating through a list of listener records, checking for the presence of a specific listener (`p1`), and removing it if found. This operation does not seem to directly expose sensitive data or perform actions that would typically require dangerous permissions.
   - However, the interaction with system-level components (like `HdmiControlService`) and the management of listeners suggest that this method operates within a context that requires some level of system or signature protection.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves unlinking a death recipient (`v16.unlinkToDeath(v13, 0)`) and removing records from `mSystemAudioModeChangeListenerRecords`. These operations are specific to listener management and do not inherently suggest dangerous access control levels.
   - The calls to `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)` and similar nested methods indicate interactions with system services, suggesting that the method's access should be restricted to system or signature levels for security reasons.

Given these considerations:

- **Similar APIs** are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating a need for either system-level access or a specific signature to call these methods securely.
- The **code snippet and sink code analysis** show interactions with system services and listener management that do not expose sensitive data directly but still require careful access control.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality, its similarity to other APIs assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, and the nature of its interactions, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
