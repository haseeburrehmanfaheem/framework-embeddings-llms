To assign an access control level to the `getActiveSource` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels. 

The `getActiveSource` method appears to be related to HDMI device information and CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) local devices. It retrieves the active source device info based on certain conditions.

Looking at the provided sink code, we see that it involves building an `HdmiDeviceInfo` object using its builder class, setting properties like physical address, port ID, vendor ID, and display name.

The similar APIs provided are `addHardwareDevice(I)V`, which have a similarity score of 0.7681806683540344 and 0.761987566947937, respectively, and both have an access control level of NONE.

Although these APIs seem to be related to hardware devices (in this case, TV input hardware), their primary function is adding or managing device information rather than directly accessing sensitive data or performing actions that could compromise the system's security.

Given that `getActiveSource` method primarily deals with retrieving information about the active HDMI source and does not directly imply any dangerous operations such as modifying system settings, accessing sensitive user data, or requiring special permissions (like SIG or SYS permissions), its access control level can be considered as not critical for system security or user privacy.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparison with similar APIs, the `getActiveSource` method should have an access control level that reflects its nature of retrieving device information without posing significant risks to system integrity or user data.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice is made considering that while it doesn't seem to require the highest level of protection (like SYS_OR_SIG), it's also not entirely without any need for access control, as it deals with device information. Hence, a NORMAL access control level seems appropriate, assuming it follows standard practices for such methods within its context.
