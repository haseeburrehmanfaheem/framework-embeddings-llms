To assign an access control level to the `sendKeyEvent` method, we must consider the provided information about its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs along with their access control levels.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `sendKeyEvent` method involves creating a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$3` and then running it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);`. This action suggests interaction with system services or threads, which typically requires careful access control to prevent misuse.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets involve creating instances of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$3` and executing them through `runOnServiceThread` or posting via a handler (`mHandler.post`). These operations indicate potential interactions with system resources or threads that could have security implications if not properly controlled.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `portSelect(ILandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute, reflecting its potential impact on system resources.
   - The API `sendVolumeKeyEvent(IIZ)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This similarity in access control with `portSelect` suggests that operations related to controlling or sending events (like volume key events) are considered sensitive and thus restricted.

Given these considerations, the `sendKeyEvent` method appears to interact with system resources or threads in a manner similar to its counterpart APIs (`portSelect` and `sendVolumeKeyEvent`). These interactions could have security implications if not properly controlled. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects the need for protection against unauthorized access.

Based on the analysis of the provided code snippets, sink codes, and the access control levels of similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `sendKeyEvent` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This choice aligns with the levels assigned to its similar APIs, reflecting a requirement for system or signature-level permissions to ensure that such operations are securely controlled.
