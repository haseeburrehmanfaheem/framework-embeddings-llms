To determine the access control level for the `getDeviceList` API, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The provided code snippets for `getDeviceList` seem to be incomplete or incorrectly formatted, making it challenging to understand their logic fully. However, they appear to involve iterating over a collection of device information (`mSafeAllDeviceInfos`) and potentially adding devices to a list (`v7`) based on certain conditions.
   - The method starts by setting the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, which might imply some level of access control or permission checking.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets provided show the creation of an `ArrayList` and the addition of elements to it, followed by returning the list. This pattern is consistent with the code snippets for `getDeviceList`, suggesting that the method is designed to return a list of devices.
   - There's no explicit permission check or sensitive data handling visible in the provided sink codes.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs (`getPrintServices(II)Ljava/util/List;`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - These APIs also involve creating a list and adding elements to it, similar to the `getDeviceList` method.

Given these observations:

- The `getDeviceList` API seems to be involved in retrieving and listing device information, which could potentially be sensitive depending on the context (e.g., HDMI device listings).
- The absence of explicit permission checks in the provided code does not necessarily mean that no access control is required; it might be handled at a different level or implicitly through the `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();` call.
- The similar APIs, with their `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggest that listing devices or services might require elevated permissions to protect sensitive information or system functionality.

Considering these points and without explicit evidence of dangerous operations (like direct hardware manipulation, financial transactions, etc.) but noting the potential for accessing sensitive device information, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects a balance between protecting user privacy/device information and allowing legitimate access for applications needing to list devices.
