To determine the access control level for the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method has a depth of 2 and interacts with the `HdmiControlService` class. It creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$6` and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v13)`.

The sink code for this method is similar to the ones found in the provided APIs, specifically:

* `HdmiControlService$BinderService$6 v13 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$6(p0);` followed by `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v13);`
* The other two sink code snippets also create an instance of a subclass of `HdmiControlService$BinderService` and post it to the handler using `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`.

The similar APIs provided, `oneTouchPlay` and `queryDisplayStatus`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. They both interact with the `HdmiControlService` class in a similar way, creating instances of subclasses of `HdmiControlService$BinderService` and posting them to the handler.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method should have the same access control level.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
