To determine the access control level for the `setCecSettingIntValue` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show that `setCecSettingIntValue` interacts with the HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) settings. It retrieves a setting by its name (`p1`), checks if the value type is "int", and then updates the setting with the provided integer value (`p2`). The method also logs debug messages and stores the updated value in system properties, global settings, or shared preferences based on the storage type.

The similar APIs `setCecSettingStringValue` and `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access and modify CEC settings.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and `setCecSettingIntValue`, it's reasonable to conclude that `setCecSettingIntValue` also requires system or signature-level permissions to update CEC settings. This is because all three methods interact with sensitive CEC settings, which should be protected from unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setCecSettingIntValue` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
