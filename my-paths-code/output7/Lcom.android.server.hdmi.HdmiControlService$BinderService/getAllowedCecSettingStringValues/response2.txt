To assign an access control level to the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method appears to be retrieving a list of allowed string values for a specific CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) setting. It interacts with `HdmiCecConfig` and `HdmiCecConfig$Setting` objects, which are also used in the similar APIs.

The two similar APIs, `getCecSettingIntValue` and `getCecSettingStringValue`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also related to CEC settings, but they retrieve integer or string values instead of a list of allowed string values.

Given the similarities in the code and the interaction with the same objects (`HdmiCecConfig` and `HdmiCecConfig$Setting`), it is likely that the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method should have a similar access control level.

The method does not seem to pose any significant risks or require special permissions, as it only retrieves information about allowed CEC setting string values. However, since it interacts with system-level objects and settings, it may still require some level of access control.

Based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method, as it is similar to the access control levels of the provided APIs and reflects the method's interaction with system-level objects and settings.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment assumes that the method does not pose any significant security risks and can be accessed by system or signature-protected components. However, if additional information or context suggests a different access control level, it may need to be adjusted accordingly.
