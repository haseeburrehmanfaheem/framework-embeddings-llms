Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `removeHotplugEventListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeHotplugEventListener` method appears to be removing a listener from a list of hotplug event listeners. The method iterates over the list, checks if the listener to be removed matches any existing listener, and if so, removes it from the list.

The similar APIs provided, `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods seem to perform a similar operation, removing a listener from a list of listeners. The code snippets provided for these methods show a similar structure to the `removeHotplugEventListener` method, iterating over a list and removing a matching listener.

Given the similarities between these methods and their access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeHotplugEventListener` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, the final access control level for the `removeHotplugEventListener` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
