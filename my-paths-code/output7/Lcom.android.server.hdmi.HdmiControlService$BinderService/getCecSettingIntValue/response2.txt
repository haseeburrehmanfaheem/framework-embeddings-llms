To determine the access control level for the `getCecSettingIntValue` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with similar logic, involving retrieving a CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) setting value based on a given string parameter `p1`. The logic includes checking the type of the setting, its default value, and then reading from shared preferences, global settings, or system properties depending on the setting's storage type.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `HdmiCecConfig` settings, including getting a setting by its name, retrieving its default value, and parsing values from storage.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `getCecSettingStringValue`, which have a high similarity score with the method in question. Both of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The logic in these similar APIs involves getting settings by name, checking their value types, and retrieving values from storage or default values.

Given this information:

- **Similarity in Logic**: The `getCecSettingIntValue` method and the provided similar APIs (`getCecSettingStringValue`) all deal with retrieving CEC setting values. They differ primarily in the type of value they retrieve (integer vs. string) but share a common pattern of accessing settings through `HdmiCecConfig`.
  
- **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute.

- **Nature of the Method**: The `getCecSettingIntValue` method reads from settings that could potentially be sensitive (e.g., system properties, shared preferences) but does not seem to modify any state. It primarily involves reading operations based on a provided setting name.

Considering these points:

- The method is related to system settings and configurations, which often require specific permissions.
- The similar APIs have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, suggesting that operations related to CEC settings are considered sensitive enough to require either system or signature-level access.
- The method's logic involves reading from potentially sensitive storage areas.

**Conclusion**: Given the similarities in logic and purpose with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, and considering the nature of the operations (reading from system settings), it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `getCecSettingIntValue`.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the method's involvement with potentially sensitive system settings and configurations, aligning with the access controls applied to similar methods in the API set.
