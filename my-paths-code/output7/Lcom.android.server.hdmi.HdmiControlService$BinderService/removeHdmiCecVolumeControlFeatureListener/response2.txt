To determine the access control level for the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics and sinks involved in these methods.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**:
   - The `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` API has a high similarity score (0.8475878238677979) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves registering a listener, which implies a need for system or signature-level permission to ensure that only authorized components can listen to volume control feature changes.
   - The `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` API also has a high similarity score (0.8329392671585083) and is assigned the same access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves removing a status change listener, which similarly requires system or signature-level permission to prevent unauthorized removal of listeners.

2. **Semantics and Sinks**:
   - The `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method removes a listener that is presumably listening for volume control feature changes related to HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control). Removing such a listener could potentially be used in a manner that disrupts or manipulates the expected behavior of connected devices, especially if done without proper authorization.
   - The sink code indicates that this removal involves internal record management (`this.mHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListenerRecords.unregister(p1)`) and potentially affects how volume control commands are handled across connected HDMI devices.

Given these considerations:

- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions.
- The semantics of removing a listener for HDMI CEC volume control features suggest that this operation should also be restricted to prevent unauthorized or malicious removals that could disrupt device functionality.
- The high similarity scores with these APIs imply that the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method should likely adhere to a similar security posture.

**Conclusion**: Based on the provided information, the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to ensure that only system or signature-level authorized components can remove HDMI CEC volume control feature listeners, thereby protecting against potential misuse or disruption of connected device functionality.
