To determine the access control level for the `queryDisplayStatus` method, we should consider the similarities with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs, `powerOffRemoteDevice` and `setSystemAudioMode`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that methods interacting with the HDMI control service in a similar manner are considered to require system or signature-level permissions.

The `queryDisplayStatus` method involves creating a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7` and running it on the service thread, which is analogous to how the similar APIs interact with their respective runnables. This interaction pattern implies that `queryDisplayStatus` is also accessing system-level functionality related to HDMI control.

Given these similarities in behavior and purpose, it's reasonable to infer that `queryDisplayStatus` would require a comparable level of access control. Therefore, without explicit indicators suggesting a lesser or greater restriction (such as dangerous operations that might elevate it to `DANGEROUS` or indications that no special permissions are needed which could suggest `NONE`), the most appropriate access control level for `queryDisplayStatus`, based on the provided information and comparisons, would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
