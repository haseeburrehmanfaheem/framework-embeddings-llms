To analyze this code snippet and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, we need to examine each instruction carefully.

The given API is `onReceive`, which takes two parameters: `Context p1` and `Intent p2`. 

Here's a breakdown of what happens in the method:

1. **Creation of new object**: A new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor. This follows one of the positive rules since it's created with data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and potentially `p1`).

2. **Method invocation**: The `start()` method is invoked on the newly created object `v1`. While this doesn't directly follow the naming similarity rule or explicitly use the input parameters, it does operate on an object created using those parameters, thus indirectly being influenced by them.

Given these observations and the fact that there's a clear data flow link between creating the `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` instance (which uses API parameters) and invoking its `start()` method, we can consider this as part of a coherent sink set. 

Here is the JSON representation of the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v1.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This sink set includes both the creation of a new object with API parameters and the subsequent method invocation on that object, demonstrating a clear data flow link between these instructions.
