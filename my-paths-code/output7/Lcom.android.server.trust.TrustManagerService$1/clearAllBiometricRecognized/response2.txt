To determine the access control level for the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method clears all biometric recognitions by calling `v3.clear()` on a `SparseBooleanArray` that keeps track of users unlocked by biometrics. It also sends messages to handlers under certain conditions, which might be related to updating the state or notifying other parts of the system about the change in biometric recognition status.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves clearing a `SparseBooleanArray` (which directly impacts the tracking of biometric unlock statuses for users) and creating a bundle with an "except" integer value, which is then sent as part of a message. This suggests interaction with system-level components or services that handle user authentication and authorization.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `unlockedByBiometricForUser` API has a high similarity score (0.8429791331291199) and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method updates the biometric unlock status for a specific user, which is a system-level operation affecting user authentication.
   - The `getPrimaryUser` API, although less similar in functionality, still operates within the realm of user management (similarity score of 0.746159017086029) and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to user identification and authentication are considered sensitive.

Given these points:

- The operation performed by `clearAllBiometricRecognized` affects system-level tracking of biometric unlock statuses, which is a critical aspect of device security and user authentication.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores are classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute, highlighting their sensitivity in terms of system integrity and user privacy.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's impact on system-level biometric recognition tracking and its similarity to other APIs classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to ensure that such operations are only performed by authorized components or services.
