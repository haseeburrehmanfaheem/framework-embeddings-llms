To determine the access control level for the `isDeviceLocked` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The `isDeviceLocked` method involves several key operations:

1. **CallingUid Check**: It starts by checking the calling UID using `ITrustManager$Stub.getCallingUid()`, which is a common pattern for access control in Android services.
2. **Virtual Device Management**: It interacts with `VirtualDeviceManagerInternal`, checking if a display is owned by any virtual device, which suggests involvement with multi-user or virtualization features.
3. **Lock Pattern Utils**: The method uses `LockPatternUtils` to check if separate profile challenge is enabled for a user, indicating it deals with security settings related to user profiles.
4. **Profile Parent Retrieval**: In some paths, it retrieves the profile parent of a given user ID using `this.mUserManager.getProfileParent(p2)`, further suggesting its role in managing or querying device security across different user profiles.

The similar APIs provided, `isDeviceSecure(II)Z`, share similarities with `isDeviceLocked` in terms of:

- Checking the calling UID and PID.
- Interacting with virtual device management and lock pattern utilities.
- Handling user profiles and their parents.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies that these methods are either signature protected (i.e., can only be called by applications signed with the same certificate as the application defining the method) or require a specific system-level permission to access. Given the nature of `isDeviceLocked` and its interactions with sensitive device security features, it's reasonable to infer that it would also require a similar level of protection.

Therefore, considering the code paths, the involvement with security-critical components like lock patterns and user profiles, and the similarity with other APIs that are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, the access control level for `isDeviceLocked` should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
