Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method interacts with a `Handler` object, which is used to send and remove messages. The method removes a message with code 6, sends an empty message with code 6, and then runs a lambda function using `runWithScissors`.

The similar APIs, `reportEnabledTrustAgentsChanged` and `unregisterTrustListener`, also interact with the same `Handler` object and have similar functionality. They both send messages to the handler, but with different codes.

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to execute.

Given the similarity in functionality and the fact that `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` also interacts with the same `Handler` object, it is likely that this method also requires system or signature-level permission to execute.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
