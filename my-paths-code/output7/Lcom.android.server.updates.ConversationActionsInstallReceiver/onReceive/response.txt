To analyze this code snippet and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Method Invocation**: The `onReceive` method is invoked with parameters `Context p1` and `Intent p2`. However, the focus should be on what happens within this method.

2. **Object Creation**: An instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created, which takes three parameters: `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`. This object creation follows one of the positive rules because it involves data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and potentially `p1`, assuming `p0` might be a context or other relevant data).

3. **Method Invocation on Object**: The `start()` method is invoked on the newly created `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object. This could be considered a sink because it's an action taken based on the creation of an object that involves API parameters.

Given these points, here's how we can categorize the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v1.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This JSON indicates that there's one set of instructions that together form a potential sink. The creation of the `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object directly influences the invocation of its `start()` method, showing a clear dataflow link between these instructions. Since there are no other identified sinks in this code snippet, this single array represents all relevant code for potential sinks.
