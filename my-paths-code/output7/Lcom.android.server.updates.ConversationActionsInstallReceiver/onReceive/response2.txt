Based on the provided information, we can see that the `onReceive` method has a similarity score of 1.0 with two other APIs, which means they are identical in terms of code and functionality. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`, as it performs a similar operation (starting a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`) without any apparent sensitive or restricted functionality.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
