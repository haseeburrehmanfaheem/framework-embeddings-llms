To assign an access control level to the `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics and sinks involved in the method.

1. **Similarity Scores and Access Control Levels:**
   - The two similar APIs provided have high similarity scores (0.9369354248046875 and 0.8742326498031616) with the `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` method, indicating that their functionalities are closely related.
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that they do not pose significant security risks or require special permissions to execute.

2. **Semantics and Sinks:**
   - The `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` method is involved in retrieving the user's preferred display mode for a given display ID.
   - The sinks provided show interactions with `LogicalDisplay` and `DisplayDevice` objects, which are related to managing and configuring display settings.
   - The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)` to manage caller identity temporarily, which is a common pattern in Android system services for securely handling requests without leaking the caller's identity.

3. **Access Control Decision:**
   - Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the method's functionality is related to retrieving display settings (which typically does not involve sensitive user data or dangerous operations), it suggests that `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` should also have a relatively permissive access control level.
   - Since the method does not appear to pose significant security risks, handle sensitive data, or perform actions that could adversely affect the system or other applications without explicit user consent (characteristics of `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` levels when considering broader implications), it aligns most closely with an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is grounded in the method's similarity to other APIs with a `NONE` access control level, its functionality not posing significant security risks, and its alignment with typical patterns for managing display settings without requiring elevated permissions.
