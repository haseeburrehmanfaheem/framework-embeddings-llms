To determine the access control level for the `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method seems to be involved in managing display settings, specifically concerning High Dynamic Range (HDR) capabilities. It takes an array of integers (`[I p1`) representing HDR types that are disabled for a user. The method checks if the provided array is a subset of known HDR types, sorts it, and then updates internal state based on whether the new set differs from the current one.

2. **Interaction with Sinks**: The sink code indicates interactions with `setUserDisabledHdrTypesInternal`, which suggests that this method indirectly influences or sets internal states related to user-disabled HDR types. This interaction is crucial for understanding its access control needs, as it implies a potential impact on system settings or behavior.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method seems to control whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed, which is closely related to the functionality of `setUserDisabledHdrTypes`.
   - Both instances of `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V` have high similarity scores with `setUserDisabledHdrTypes`, indicating their functionalities are closely aligned in terms of system impact and security considerations.

4. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Given that `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` directly influences system settings related to display capabilities, which could be considered a sensitive aspect of device configuration, it likely requires a certain level of access control.
   - The high similarity with APIs having an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests that `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` should also have a restricted access level. This is because altering HDR settings could potentially impact system performance, security, or user experience significantly.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the method's functionality, its interaction with internal system settings through sinks, and its similarity to other APIs with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is reasonable to conclude that `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only system or signature applications can modify these sensitive settings, maintaining the security and integrity of the device.
