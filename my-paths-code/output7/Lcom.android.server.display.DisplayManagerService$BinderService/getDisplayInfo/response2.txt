To determine the access control level for the `getDisplayInfo` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `getDisplayInfo` method has two paths with depth 2. Both paths involve retrieving display information using the `LogicalDisplay` object and checking if the UID has access to the display. If the UID has access, it returns the display info; otherwise, it returns null (in path 2) or the display info anyway (in path 1).

The sink code snippets show that the method interacts with sensitive display information, such as `LogicalDisplay`, `DisplayEventReceiver$FrameRateOverride`, and `DisplayInfo`.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. The `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` API has a high similarity score (0.8706) and also interacts with display information using the `LogicalDisplay` object. The `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` API has a moderate similarity score (0.8583) but does not perform any access control checks.

Considering the code snippets, sink code, and similar APIs, it appears that the `getDisplayInfo` method does perform some access control checks using the `hasAccess` method and `isUidPresentOnDisplayInternal` method. However, these checks are not stringent enough to warrant a `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Given the similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getDisplayInfo` method. This level indicates that the method performs some access control checks, but they are not overly restrictive.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
