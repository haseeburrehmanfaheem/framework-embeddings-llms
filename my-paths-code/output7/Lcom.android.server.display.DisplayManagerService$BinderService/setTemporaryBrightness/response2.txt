Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `setTemporaryBrightness` method to determine its access control level.

The method interacts with a `DisplayManagerService$SyncRoot` and a `SparseArray` of `DisplayPowerControllers`, which suggests that it is related to display settings. The method also sends a message to a handler using `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget`, which is similar to the behavior of the provided similar APIs.

The similar APIs, `removeImeSurface()` and `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout(I)V`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also send messages to handlers using `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget`, which is a key similarity with the `setTemporaryBrightness` method.

Given these similarities, it is likely that the `setTemporaryBrightness` method requires a similar access control level. The fact that it interacts with display settings and sends messages to a handler suggests that it may require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setTemporaryBrightness` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
