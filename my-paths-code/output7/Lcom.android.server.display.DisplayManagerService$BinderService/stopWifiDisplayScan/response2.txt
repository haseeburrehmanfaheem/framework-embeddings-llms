To assign an access control level to the `stopWifiDisplayScan` method, we must consider its functionality, the context in which it is called, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Functionality**: The `stopWifiDisplayScan` method stops a WiFi display scan. This operation involves managing system resources related to display and network capabilities, suggesting it could impact system performance or security if not properly controlled.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - The provided similar APIs are variations of `startWifiDisplayScan`, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This level indicates that these methods should only be accessible to system or signature applications, implying they perform sensitive operations.
   - The similarity in names and the context (involving WiFi display scans) suggest that starting and stopping such scans could require similar levels of access control due to their potential impact on system resources and user experience.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The method uses `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`, followed by `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v4)`. This pattern suggests the method is checking or managing the identity of the caller, which is a common practice when enforcing access control.
   - The call to `DisplayManagerService.stopWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7)` indicates that the actual stopping of the WiFi display scan is handled internally by the service after necessary checks.

Given these considerations:
- **SYS_OR_SIG** seems an appropriate choice for the `stopWifiDisplayScan` method. This is because it aligns with the access control level assigned to its similar APIs (`startWifiDisplayScan`) and reflects the potential sensitivity of managing WiFi display scans, which could be restricted to system or signature applications to prevent misuse.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
