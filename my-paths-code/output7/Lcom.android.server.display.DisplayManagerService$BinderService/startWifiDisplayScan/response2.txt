To determine the access control level for the `startWifiDisplayScan` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `startWifiDisplayScan` method checks if a callback is registered (`Object v7 = this.mCallbacks.get(p2);`) and then proceeds to call `DisplayManagerService.startWifiDisplayScanLocked(v7);` if the condition is met, followed by restoring the calling identity. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided code snippet as it checks for `v7 == 0` before attempting to use `v7`, which could potentially lead to a NullPointerException or indicate an error in the transcription of the code.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink codes suggest that the method internally calls `startWifiDisplayScanInternal(v3)` on `this.this$0`, where `v3` is the PID (Process ID) of the calling process obtained via `Binder.getCallingPid()`. This implies interaction with system-level services, specifically those related to display management.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`stopWifiDisplayScan()V`) have a high similarity score and are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These methods also interact with system-level services by calling `stopWifiDisplayScanInternal(v3)` on `this.this$0`, using the PID of the calling process.
   - The use of `Binder.getCallingPid()` in both similar APIs and the method in question suggests a pattern of requiring system or signature level permissions to interact with these display management services.

Given this analysis, the key points to consider are:
- The interaction with system-level display management services.
- The use of `Binder.getCallingPid()`, which is commonly seen in methods that require elevated permissions to ensure only authorized processes can invoke certain operations.
- The similarity with other APIs (`stopWifiDisplayScan()V`) that have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they are either system-level APIs or require signature-level permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the interaction with system services and the pattern observed in similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `startWifiDisplayScan` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because starting a Wi-Fi display scan likely requires privileges that are either system-level or signature-level to prevent unauthorized access to device functionality.
