To determine the access control level for the `setVirtualDisplaySurface` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `setVirtualDisplaySurface` method involves setting a virtual display surface with a given callback and surface. It checks if the surface is single-buffered and then proceeds to interact with an adapter (likely related to display management) after clearing and later restoring the calling identity. This suggests that it handles display-related operations at a potentially privileged level.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions that could affect system-level resources or behaviors, such as checking if a surface is single-buffered, clearing and restoring calling identities (which implies dealing with Binder transactions and thus inter-process communication), and setting surfaces on adapters. These operations can be critical for display management and might require certain privileges.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `setVirtualDisplayState` API has an access control level of `NONE`. It involves setting the state of a virtual display with a callback and a boolean value, interacting with its adapter in a locked manner. Despite dealing with display states, it doesn't seem to require elevated permissions.
   - The `resizeVirtualDisplay` API also has an access control level of `NONE`. It resizes a virtual display based on provided dimensions and interacts with the adapter in a similar locked context. Again, this operation is specific to display management but does not appear to necessitate high-level access controls.

4. **Determining Access Control Level**: Given that both similar APIs (`setVirtualDisplayState` and `resizeVirtualDisplay`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that operations related to virtual displays (state changes, resizing) are considered safe or standard within the context of display management. However, the interaction with Binder identities and the potential impact on system resources (display surfaces) could imply a need for some level of protection.

Considering these points:
- The method does not explicitly handle sensitive data (like user credentials, location data, etc.) that would require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.
- It interacts with system-level display management but through an adapter and after appropriate identity clearance, suggesting it might not need the highest level of protection.
- The similar APIs have `NONE` access control levels, indicating standard operations within display management do not require elevated permissions.

Therefore, given the specific nature of this method's interactions (display surface management, Binder transactions), yet considering the similar APIs' access control levels and the lack of explicit sensitive data handling, a balanced approach would be to assign an access control level that reflects its operational scope without overestimating the risk.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
