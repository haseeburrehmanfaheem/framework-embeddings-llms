To determine the access control level for the `getBrightnessEvents` API, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The provided code snippets for `getBrightnessEvents` show that it interacts with various system components, such as `DisplayManagerService`, `UserManager`, and `BrightnessTracker`. It also involves operations like getting user IDs, profile IDs, and brightness events, which are then filtered and returned as a `ParceledListSlice`.

The sink code indicates that the API is involved in retrieving and manipulating sensitive information related to display brightness events.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `getAmbientBrightnessStats()` with a similarity score of 0.8020080327987671 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
2. Another instance of `getAmbientBrightnessStats()` with a slightly lower similarity score of 0.7581281065940857, also having an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require either system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive information related to ambient brightness statistics.

Given the similarities in functionality (dealing with brightness-related data) and the operations involved (retrieving and manipulating sensitive display information), it's reasonable to infer that `getBrightnessEvents` would also require a similar level of access control. The SYS_OR_SIG access control level is typically assigned to APIs that provide access to sensitive system information or functionalities that could potentially be used to interfere with system operations or user privacy.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the analysis of similar APIs, the `getBrightnessEvents` API should also have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
