To determine the access control level for the `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves getting a user's serial number using `UserManager` and then retrieves brightness configuration from a persistent data store based on display and user information. This includes interacting with various system services and data stores.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `getUserSerialNumber` and retrieving brightness configurations, which are similar to the operations performed in the method of interest.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `getBrightnessConfigurationForUser`, with high similarity scores (0.9710339903831482 and 0.9625337719917297). Both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These similar APIs also deal with retrieving brightness configurations but are specifically for users based on their serial numbers.

Given the information:
- The method `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` involves system-level operations, such as interacting with `UserManager`, accessing display devices, and handling brightness configurations. This suggests it requires a certain level of system access or signature permission.
- The similarity in functionality and code structure between `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` and the provided similar APIs (`getBrightnessConfigurationForUser`) indicates that they likely require similar levels of access control.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies that they can only be accessed by system applications or those signed with the platform key, due to their interaction with sensitive system data and services.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to conclude that `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` should also have a similar access control requirement due to its interactions with system services and sensitive user and display information.

**Access Control Level**: Given the method's functionality and similarities with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, the most appropriate access control level for `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
