Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method.

The method is similar to `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The similarity score between these methods is high (0.9653550982475281 and 0.9627465009689331), indicating that they share similar functionality.

The sink code for `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` involves modifying a setting (`are_user_disabled_hdr_formats_allowed`) using `Settings$Global.putInt`, which suggests that it has some level of system-wide impact. Additionally, the method iterates over displays using `this.mLogicalDisplayMapper.forEachLocked(v9)`, which may also have system-wide implications.

Given these observations and the similarity to other methods with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, we can infer that `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` should also have a similar access control level.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's similarity to other APIs with system-wide implications and its potential impact on display settings.
