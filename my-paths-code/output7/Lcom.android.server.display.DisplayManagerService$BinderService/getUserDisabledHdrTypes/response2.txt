To determine the access control level for the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method simply returns the value of `this.mUserDisabledHdrTypes`, which suggests it is accessing and returning internal state without performing any modifications or sensitive operations.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z**: This method has an access control level of NONE, indicating it does not pose a significant risk. Its similarity score with `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` is 0.8347076177597046, suggesting they share similar characteristics or functionalities.
   - **setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V**: With an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, this method implies that setting user disabled HDR types requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to the potential impact on system configuration or behavior. The similarity score with `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` is 0.8134934306144714, indicating a relationship but also differences in their operations (one sets, the other gets).

3. **Semantics and Risks**: 
   - Getting user-disabled HDR types does not inherently pose a risk similar to setting them. The act of retrieving information about disabled types doesn't modify system state or directly impact security, privacy, or system integrity.
   - However, considering it's related to display management and HDR settings, there might be indirect implications for user experience or data handling that are not immediately apparent from the method name alone.

4. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method does not modify state and is primarily about accessing information, it leans towards a less restrictive access control level.
   - The similarity with `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z`, which has an access control level of NONE, supports the notion that accessing this type of information might not require stringent permissions.
   - However, considering the context of system services and potential implications for system configuration or behavior (even if indirectly), a moderate approach is reasonable.

Given these considerations, assigning an access control level of **NONE** seems most appropriate. This decision reflects the method's nature as primarily informational without direct modification capabilities or significant risk implications. It aligns with the less sensitive nature of accessing rather than modifying system settings and is consistent with similar APIs that also deal with accessing information about user preferences or settings.
