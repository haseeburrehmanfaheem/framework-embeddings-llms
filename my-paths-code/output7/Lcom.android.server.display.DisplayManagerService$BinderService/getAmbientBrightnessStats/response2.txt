To assign an access control level to the `getAmbientBrightnessStats` method, we must consider the similarities with other APIs that have known access control levels, the semantics of these APIs, and how they interact with sinks.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The provided similar APIs (`getBrightnessEvents`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that these methods are considered sensitive or require specific permissions (either system or signature-level) to access the brightness events data. The similarity scores (0.802 and 0.758) suggest a strong likeness in functionality or purpose between `getAmbientBrightnessStats` and `getBrightnessEvents`, implying that they might handle similar types of data or operations.

2. **Semantics of the APIs**: Both `getAmbientBrightnessStats` and `getBrightnessEvents` seem to deal with retrieving specific types of data related to display brightness, which could be considered sensitive from a privacy perspective (e.g., understanding user habits) or crucial for system functionality (e.g., adjusting screen brightness based on ambient light).

3. **Interaction with Sinks**: The provided sink code snippets show how the methods interact with internal components (`mBrightnessTracker`, `mAmbientBrightnessStatsTracker`) to retrieve data. This interaction suggests that these methods have access to potentially sensitive information or system internals, which might require elevated permissions.

Given these considerations:

- The similarity in functionality and purpose between `getAmbientBrightnessStats` and the `SYS_OR_SIG` rated `getBrightnessEvents` APIs.
- The potential sensitivity of the data being accessed (ambient brightness statistics).
- The interaction with internal system components to retrieve this data.

It is reasonable to conclude that `getAmbientBrightnessStats` should also be assigned an access control level that reflects its need for either system or signature-level permissions to protect potentially sensitive operations or data.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the treatment of similar APIs (`getBrightnessEvents`) and acknowledges the potential sensitivity of the data and operations involved in `getAmbientBrightnessStats`.
