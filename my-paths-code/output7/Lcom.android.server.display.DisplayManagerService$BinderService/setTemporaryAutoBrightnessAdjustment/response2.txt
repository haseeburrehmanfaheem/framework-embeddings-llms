To determine the access control level for the `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` method involves sending a message to a handler with the brightness adjustment value after converting it to an integer. This operation seems to affect the display's power settings temporarily.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code indicates that the method interacts with a `DisplayPowerController` object (retrieved from `mDisplayPowerControllers`) and sends a message to adjust the temporary auto-brightness. This suggests that the method has an impact on device hardware, specifically display settings.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **removeUidPolicy(II)V**: This API has a similarity score of 0.8553171157836914 with `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment`. It is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission due to its impact on policy removal for UIDs.
   - **reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock(ZI)V**: With a similarity score of 0.846314013004303, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It reports successful biometric unlocks, which is a sensitive operation likely requiring system-level permissions.

Given these points:

- The method interacts with device hardware (display settings) and requires some form of permission to ensure that only authorized components can adjust the display's brightness temporarily.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that operations affecting system settings or sensitive data typically require higher levels of access control.

Considering the impact on device settings and the similarity with other APIs that require system or signature-level permissions, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` to ensure that such adjustments are made securely and with proper authorization.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects the method's potential impact on system settings and the need for it to be accessible only to components with appropriate permissions.
