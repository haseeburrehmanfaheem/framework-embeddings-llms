To determine the access control level for the `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId` method, we should consider the similarity scores and the access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the nature of the operations performed by these methods.

1. **Similarity Scores and Access Control Levels**:
   - The two similar APIs (`getColorMode()I`) have similarity scores of 0.775672197341919 and 0.7313717007637024, respectively. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.
   
2. **Nature of Operations**:
   - All the methods (including `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId`) seem to be involved in retrieving some form of display or color-related settings.
   - The operations within these methods are relatively straightforward, involving calls to internal methods to retrieve specific IDs or modes and then returning these values.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that these operations are not considered sensitive in terms of security or privacy.
   - The `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId` method, by retrieving a preferred color space ID, does not seem to perform any operation that would compromise security, privacy, or system integrity.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the similarity scores and the access control levels of the similar APIs, as well as the nature of the operations performed by `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method does not require a high level of access control.
   - Therefore, the appropriate access control level for `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId` would be `NONE`.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
