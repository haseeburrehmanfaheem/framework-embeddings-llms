To determine the access control level for the `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` method retrieves the refresh rate switching type from `this.mModeSwitchingType`. It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)` to manage the calling identity temporarily, which suggests it is interacting with system-level functionalities but does not directly imply a specific access control level.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets show that the method's result is directly returned or assigned from other methods (`getRefreshRateSwitchingTypeInternal`, `getModeSwitchingType`), indicating a straightforward data retrieval process without explicit security checks or sensitive data manipulation visible in the provided snippet.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode()` method, with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggests that methods related to display mode and refresh rate switching might require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on system performance and user experience.
   - The `setRefreshRateSwitchingType(I)V` method, also with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, further supports the notion that operations affecting refresh rate switching are considered sensitive.

Given these points:
- The method interacts with system-level data (refresh rate switching type) which could impact device performance or user experience.
- Similar methods (`shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode`, `setRefreshRateSwitchingType`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that such operations are restricted to system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the method's functionality and the access control levels of similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it deals with system-critical information related to display settings.
