To assign an access control level to the `getBrightnessInfo` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getBrightnessInfo` method appears to retrieve brightness information for a specific display, identified by the parameter `p1`. It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` to manage the calling identity, which suggests that it interacts with system-level components. The method also accesses a `SparseArray` of display power controllers (`mDisplayPowerControllers`) and retrieves an object from this array based on the input parameter `p1`.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. **getBrightnessConfigurationForUser**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7391607165336609 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with user-specific data (retrieving a user's serial number) and accesses brightness configurations.

2. **getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay**: With a similarity score of 0.7080804705619812, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves brightness configurations for a specific display.

Both similar APIs are assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute due to their interaction with sensitive system components and data.

Given the similarities in functionality (retrieving display-related information) and the use of system-level identities (`Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`), it's reasonable to conclude that the `getBrightnessInfo` method also interacts with system-level components or sensitive data. Therefore, it should be assigned a similar access control level to ensure that only authorized components can access this information.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the method's need for system or signature-level permissions due to its interaction with display power controllers and the management of calling identities, which are indicative of operations that should be restricted to authorized system components.
