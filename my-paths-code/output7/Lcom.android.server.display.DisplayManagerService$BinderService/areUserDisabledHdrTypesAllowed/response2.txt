To determine the access control level for the `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method simply returns a boolean value indicating whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed. It does not modify any state or perform any actions that could potentially affect system security or user data privacy directly.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided also just retrieves the value of `mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`, which aligns with the method's purpose of returning a boolean status without altering system settings.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute, likely because it modifies system settings related to HDR types.
   - **setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V**: Similarly, this method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It sets user-disabled HDR types, which involves changing system settings and thus requires higher access control.

Given the above analysis:
- The `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method does not modify any system settings or sensitive data. It only retrieves information about whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed.
- In contrast to its similar APIs (`setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` and `setUserDisabledHdrTypes`), which require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control due to their ability to change system settings, the `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method is read-only.

**Conclusion**: Since `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` only reads a setting without modifying it or accessing sensitive information that could compromise security or privacy, and considering its similar APIs require higher access control for modification purposes, this method should logically have a lower access control requirement. However, given the choices provided (NONE, NORMAL, DANGEROUS, SYS_OR_SIG), the most appropriate level for a method that simply returns a status without any potential to harm system security or user data would be `NORMAL`, as it is less restrictive than `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` but still implies some level of control or consideration for access, which is more aligned with the nature of this read operation compared to `NONE`.
