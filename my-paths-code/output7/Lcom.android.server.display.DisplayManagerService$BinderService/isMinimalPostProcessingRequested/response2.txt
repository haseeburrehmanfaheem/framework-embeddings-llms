To determine the access control level for the `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` method takes an integer parameter `p1` and returns a boolean value indicating whether minimal post-processing is requested. The method's implementation involves accessing the `mLogicalDisplays` map using the provided `p1` index, but ultimately, it directly returns the value of `mRequestedMinimalPostProcessing`, which does not depend on the `p1` parameter or any external state that would require elevated access permissions.

The sink code shows two possible paths:
1. One path accesses a `LogicalDisplay` object and its method to get the requested minimal post-processing, which might suggest interaction with potentially sensitive display settings.
2. The other path directly returns `mRequestedMinimalPostProcessing`, which is an internal state of the class and does not seem to access any sensitive information that would require special permissions.

Given these observations, let's compare this API with the similar ones:

- **getUserPreferredDisplayMode(I)Landroid/view/Display$Mode;** has a similarity score of 0.825708270072937 and an access control level of NONE. This method interacts with display settings but does not seem to require any special permissions beyond accessing user-preferred modes.
  
- **getDisplayInfo(I)Landroid/view/DisplayInfo;** has a similarity score of 0.7739896774291992 and also an access control level of NONE. This method retrieves display information, which might include sensitive details about the display but is classified as not requiring special permissions.

Considering these comparisons:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, indicating they do not require elevated permissions to operate.
- The `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` method, despite potentially interacting with internal states related to display processing, does so in a manner that does not seem to necessitate special access permissions, especially given its direct return of an internal boolean state without modification or sensitive data exposure.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons with similar APIs, the `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` method should be assigned an access control level of NONE, as it does not appear to require any elevated permissions or access to sensitive data that would classify it differently.
