To determine the access control level for the `isInUse` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs. The given method interacts with system properties by calling `SystemProperties.getBoolean()` to retrieve a boolean value indicating whether "ro.gsid.image_running" is set.

The provided similar API, `isInstalled()Z`, has an access control level of `NONE`. This API also retrieves a system property using `SystemProperties.getBoolean()`, but for the key "gsid.image_installed". Given the high similarity score between these two methods (0.9161214828491211), it suggests that their functionalities and potential security implications are closely related.

Since both methods:
1. Access system properties.
2. Do not seem to perform any operations that could be considered dangerous or requiring special permissions (like modifying system settings, accessing sensitive user data, etc.).
3. Are read-only in nature, simply returning a boolean value without any apparent capability to alter the state of the system or expose sensitive information.

Based on this analysis and considering the access control level of the similar API (`isInstalled()Z`) is `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that the `isInUse` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This is because it doesn't appear to pose any risk or require special system permissions beyond what's necessary for its read-only operation.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
