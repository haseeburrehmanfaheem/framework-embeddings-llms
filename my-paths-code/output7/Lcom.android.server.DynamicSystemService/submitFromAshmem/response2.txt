To determine the access control level for the `submitFromAshmem` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs. The method interacts with the `IGsiService` interface, which is obtained through the `ServiceManager.waitForService("gsiservice")` call.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of the `submitFromAshmem` method involve waiting for the "gsiservice" service and then attempting to commit a GSI chunk from ashmem using the `IGsiService` interface.
   - The primary difference among these paths lies in how they handle the interface retrieval and casting, but the core functionality of committing a GSI chunk remains consistent.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **finishInstallation()Z**: This API has an access control level of NONE. It interacts with the "gsiservice" to close an installation. The similarity score with `submitFromAshmem` is 0.8376830220222473, indicating a significant similarity in their functionality or code structure.
   - **getInstallationProgress()Landroid/gsi/GsiProgress;**: This API also has an access control level of NONE. It retrieves the installation progress from the "gsiservice". The similarity score with `submitFromAshmem` is 0.8374919891357422, suggesting a similar interaction pattern with the GSI service.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE and considering the similarities in code structure and functionality (interaction with "gsiservice" for GSI-related operations), it is reasonable to infer that `submitFromAshmem` would also require a similar access control level.
   - The method does not seem to perform any operations that would typically require elevated permissions like those classified under DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG. Its interaction with system services in a manner consistent with other NONE-level APIs suggests it does not pose significant risks warranting higher access control levels.

Based on the analysis, the `submitFromAshmem` method should have an access control level of **NONE**, as it aligns with the access control levels of similar APIs that interact with the "gsiservice" for GSI operations without requiring elevated permissions.
