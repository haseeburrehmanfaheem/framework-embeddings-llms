To determine the access control level for the `isInstalled` method, we need to analyze its functionality, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Functionality Analysis**: The `isInstalled` method checks if a certain system property ("gsid.image_installed") is set to true, indicating whether an image is installed or not. This operation does not modify any system properties but merely reads them.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided shows that it directly returns the boolean value obtained from `SystemProperties.getBoolean("gsid.image_installed", 0)`. This suggests a straightforward read operation without any modification of system states.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **isInUse()Z**: This API has an access control level of NONE and performs a similar operation by reading another system property ("ro.gsid.image_running"). The high similarity score (0.9161214828491211) indicates that `isInstalled` shares significant functionality with `isInUse()Z`, suggesting they might require similar levels of access control.
   - **abort()Z**: With an access control level of NONE and a lower similarity score (0.7116438150405884), this API is involved in canceling a GSI install operation, which is somewhat different from simply reading system properties like `isInstalled` does.

Given these points:
- The operation performed by `isInstalled` is read-only and doesn't modify any system states.
- Similar APIs (`isInUse()Z`) with high similarity scores have an access control level of NONE, indicating that such read operations might not require stringent access controls.
- The nature of the operation (reading a system property) does not inherently suggest a need for elevated permissions like DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and comparisons, assigning an access control level of **NONE** to the `isInstalled` method seems appropriate. This is because it performs a read-only operation that doesn't pose significant risks or modifications to system states, aligning with the access control levels of similar APIs.
