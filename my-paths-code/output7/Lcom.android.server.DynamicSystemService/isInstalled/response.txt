To analyze this API `isInstalled`, we'll follow the steps and rules provided:

1. **Method Invocation**: The method `SystemProperties.getBoolean` is invoked. This does not have naming similarity with `isInstalled`, but it does return a value that is directly used by the API.
2. **Field Access/Update**: There's no direct field access or update here, just a static method invocation and variable assignment.
3. **Object Creation**: No new objects are created in this code snippet.
4. **Data Flow**: The boolean value returned from `SystemProperties.getBoolean` directly influences the return value of the API.

Given these observations:

- The method invocation `SystemProperties.getBoolean` is crucial as its return value determines the API's output, thus it indirectly follows one of the positive rules by influencing the API's result.
- There are no other potential sinks based on field access/update or object creation in this simple API.

The JSON representation for the identified sink set would be:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean v1 = SystemProperties.getBoolean(\"gsid.image_installed\", 0);",
      "return v1;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This represents a coherent set of instructions where `SystemProperties.getBoolean` directly influences the return value of `isInstalled`, thereby forming a potential sink due to its impact on the API's output.
