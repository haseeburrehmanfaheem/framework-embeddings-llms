To assign an access control level to the `getIncidentReportList` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getIncidentReportList` method:

1. Clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`.
2. Gets a service instance of "incident" using `ServiceManager.getService("incident")`.
3. Converts the service instance to an `IIncidentManager` interface.
4. Calls the `getIncidentReportList` method on the `IIncidentManager` interface, passing two string parameters (`p1` and `p2`).
5. Restores the calling identity using `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)`.
6. Returns the result of the `getIncidentReportList` method call.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `IIncidentManager` interface and clear/restore the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)`.

Considering the similarities between these APIs, including:

* The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)`, which suggests a need to temporarily elevate or modify the caller's identity to access system services.
* Interaction with an `IIncidentManager` interface for incident-related operations.

Given that the similar APIs have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` as their access control level, it is reasonable to infer that the `getIncidentReportList` method should also be assigned a similar access control level due to its operational similarities and interaction with system-level services.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `getIncidentReportList` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
