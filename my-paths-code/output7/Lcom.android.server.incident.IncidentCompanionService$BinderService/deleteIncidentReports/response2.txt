To determine the access control level for the `deleteIncidentReports` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `deleteIncidentReports` method interacts with the `IIncidentManager` service, which is obtained through `ServiceManager.getService("incident")`. This service is used to delete incident reports. The method also uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` to clear and restore the calling identity, respectively.

The similar APIs provided are `deleteAllIncidentReports(Ljava/lang/String;)V`, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `IIncidentManager` service and use `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`.

Given the similarities between the `deleteIncidentReports` method and the provided similar APIs, it is likely that the `deleteIncidentReports` method requires a similar access control level. The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` suggests that the method is interacting with a system service, which typically requires a higher access control level.

Based on this analysis, the final access control level for the `deleteIncidentReports` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires either system or signature-level permission to access the `IIncidentManager` service and perform the deletion of incident reports.
