To determine the access control level for the `denyReport` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `denyReport` method involves parsing a URI from a string parameter `p1`, extracting an "id" query parameter, and then iterating through pending reports to find a match based on this id.
   - If a match is found, it removes the report from the pending list and sends a broadcast using `PendingReports.sendBroadcast()`.
   - The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)` to manage the calling identity, which is a common pattern for temporarily changing the identity of the calling process to perform operations that require specific permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets involve similar operations such as clearing the calling identity, parsing URIs, and sending broadcasts.
   - One of the sink codes directly calls `PendingReports.sendBroadcast()` without specifying parameters, which suggests interaction with system-level components or services.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **approveReport**: This method has a high similarity score (0.8743499517440796) with `denyReport` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - **deleteAllIncidentReports**: Although its similarity score (0.8640425205230713) is slightly lower than `approveReport`, it's still significant, and this method is also assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` as its access control level.
   - Both similar APIs involve system-level operations (`PendingReports.sendBroadcast()` for `approveReport` and `IIncidentManager.deleteAllIncidentReports(p1)` for `deleteAllIncidentReports`), indicating they require elevated permissions to interact with system services or components.

Given these observations:
- The operations within `denyReport`, such as sending broadcasts after clearing the calling identity, imply interaction with system-level services or components.
- The similarity in functionality and access control levels of the provided APIs (`approveReport` and `deleteAllIncidentReports`) suggests that `denyReport` likely requires a similar level of access control to perform its intended functions securely and effectively.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippets, sink codes, and especially the similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `denyReport` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
