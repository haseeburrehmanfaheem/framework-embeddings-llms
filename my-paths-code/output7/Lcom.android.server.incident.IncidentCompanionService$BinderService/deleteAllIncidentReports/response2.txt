To assign an access control level to the `deleteAllIncidentReports` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `deleteAllIncidentReports` method interacts with the `IIncidentManager` service, which is also used by the similar APIs. The method clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` before calling the `deleteAllIncidentReports` method on the `IIncidentManager` instance and then restores the calling identity using `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`. 

The two similar APIs, `deleteIncidentReports(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `IIncidentManager` service and use a similar pattern of clearing and restoring the calling identity.

Given the similarity in code patterns and interaction with the same service, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to the `deleteAllIncidentReports` method. 

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `deleteAllIncidentReports` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
