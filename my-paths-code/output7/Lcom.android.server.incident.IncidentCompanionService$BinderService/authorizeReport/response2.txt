To determine the access control level for the `authorizeReport` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `authorizeReport` method creates a new instance of `PendingReports$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` and uses it to authorize a report. The similar APIs also create new instances of lambda classes (`VcnManagementService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda2` and `IrisService$IrisServiceWrapper$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`) and use them to perform specific tasks.

The key observation here is that all these methods seem to be using lambda expressions to handle asynchronous or callback-based operations. The creation of these lambda instances does not appear to involve sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions or access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the similarity in code patterns and the absence of sensitive operations, it is reasonable to infer that the `authorizeReport` method should have a similar access control level as the provided APIs, which are classified as `NORMAL`. This classification suggests that while the method may interact with system components or user data, it does not pose a significant risk that would necessitate stricter access controls.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `authorizeReport` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
