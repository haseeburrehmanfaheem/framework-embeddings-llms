To assign an access control level to the `onReceive` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Similar APIs**: The `onReceive` method has similar APIs with a similarity score of 1.0, which indicates they are nearly identical in terms of parameters and possibly functionality.
2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the operations performed by these methods do not pose significant risks or require special permissions to execute.
3. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The code snippet for the `onReceive` method creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing in parameters, and then starts it. This pattern is consistent across the similar APIs provided.
   - The sink code also involves creating and starting `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, which implies that the core functionality does not directly interact with sensitive data or operations that would typically require elevated permissions.

Given this analysis:

- ** NONE **: Since both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the method's functionality seems to align closely with these examples (involving the creation and execution of a specific receiver without direct references to sensitive operations or data), it suggests that the `onReceive` method does not perform actions that would necessitate higher access controls like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and access control levels of comparable methods, the assigned access control level for the `onReceive` API should also be `NONE`.
