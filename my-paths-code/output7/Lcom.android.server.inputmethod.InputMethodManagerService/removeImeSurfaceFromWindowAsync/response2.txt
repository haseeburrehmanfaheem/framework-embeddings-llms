Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method. The method has a similarity score of over 95% with two other APIs, `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` and `reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The code snippets of these similar APIs show that they all use the `obtainMessage` method to create a `Message` object and then call `sendToTarget` on it. This suggests that the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method is likely interacting with a system-level handler, which would require a higher level of access control.

Given this analysis, it appears that the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method should have an access control level similar to its similar APIs, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
