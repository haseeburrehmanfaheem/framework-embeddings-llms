To determine the access control level for the `startStylusHandwriting` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show that `startStylusHandwriting` interacts with various system components, such as `ImeTracingServerImpl`, `Binder`, and `InputMethodManagerService`. It also checks the calling user's validity and the current method's support for stylus handwriting.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `isImeTraceEnabled()Z`: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and only checks if IME tracing is enabled.
2. `startImeTrace()V`: This method also has an access control level of `NONE` and starts IME tracing.

Both similar APIs have a relatively simple implementation and do not perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated access control levels.

However, `startStylusHandwriting` performs more complex checks and interactions with system components, which may indicate a need for a higher access control level. Nevertheless, the method does not seem to access or modify sensitive data, and its operations appear to be related to input method management.

Considering these factors, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `startStylusHandwriting` method, as it performs more complex operations than the similar APIs but does not require elevated privileges.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
