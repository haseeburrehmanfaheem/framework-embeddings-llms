To determine the access control level for the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method, we need to consider its similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `registerPredictionUpdates`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires either system or signature-level permission to access.
2. `requestPredictionUpdate`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these similar APIs have a high similarity score with the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method (0.995 and 0.989, respectively), which suggests that they share similar functionality or interactions.

The code snippets for these APIs show that they all create an instance of a lambda class (`AppPredictionManagerService$PredictionManagerServiceStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambdaX`) and call its `accept` method on an `AbstractPerUserSystemService` object. This pattern is also present in the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method.

Given the similarities between these APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
