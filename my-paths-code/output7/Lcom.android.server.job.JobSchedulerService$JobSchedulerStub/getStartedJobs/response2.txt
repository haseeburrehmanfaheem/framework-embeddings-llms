To determine the access control level for the `getStartedJobs` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getStartedJobs` method appears to be retrieving a list of started jobs from an `ArraySet` called `mRunningJobs`. The method iterates over the jobs in the set, checks if each job is not null, and adds it to an `ArrayList` called `v3`. Finally, the method returns the list of jobs.

The sink code provided suggests that the method interacts with `JobInfo` objects and `ArraySet` containing running jobs. This interaction is similar to the `getPendingJob` API, which also retrieves job information from a list of jobs filtered by UID.

Comparing the `getStartedJobs` method with the similar APIs:

* The `cancelAll` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that it requires system or signature-level permission to cancel all jobs. However, this API interacts with the job scheduler service and stops tracking jobs, which is a more sensitive operation than retrieving a list of started jobs.
* The `getPendingJob` API has an access control level of `NONE`, which indicates that it does not require any specific permissions to retrieve pending job information.

Given the similarities between the `getStartedJobs` method and the `getPendingJob` API, it is likely that the `getStartedJobs` method also does not require any specific permissions to retrieve a list of started jobs. The method's interaction with `JobInfo` objects and `ArraySet` containing running jobs is similar to the `getPendingJob` API, which has an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `getStartedJobs` method is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
