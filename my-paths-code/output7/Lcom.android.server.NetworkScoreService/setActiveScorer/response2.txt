To determine the access control level for the `setActiveScorer` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `setActiveScorer` method modifies system settings by writing to `"network_recommendations_package"` and `"network_recommendations_enabled"` using `mSettingsFacade.putString` and `mSettingsFacade.putInt`, respectively. This indicates that the method has the potential to affect system behavior or security, suggesting a need for restricted access.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves setting network recommendations package and enabled settings, which are system-level operations. These operations could potentially impact how the device connects to networks or how network recommendations are handled, indicating a level of sensitivity.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `getActiveScorerPackage()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that getting the active scorer package requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to its involvement with system settings and network management.
   - `getActiveScorer()` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating similar sensitivity in accessing the active scorer data.

Given these analyses, we can infer that the `setActiveScorer` method involves sensitive operations related to system settings and network management. Modifying such settings typically requires elevated permissions to prevent unauthorized changes that could compromise device security or functionality.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of the operations performed by `setActiveScorer`, including modifying system settings related to network recommendations, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should have an access control level that restricts its use to authorized components or processes within the system.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the method's involvement with sensitive system settings and network configuration, aligning with the access control levels of similar APIs that interact with related system functionalities.
