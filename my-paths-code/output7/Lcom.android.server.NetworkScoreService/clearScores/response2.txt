To determine the access control level for the `clearScores` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The similar APIs (`disableScoring()V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are restricted to either system apps or apps that have been granted a specific signature-level permission.

2. **Code Snippets of Similar APIs:**
   - Both similar APIs involve checking if the caller is an active scorer using `NetworkScoreService.isCallerActiveScorer(v1)`, which indicates a requirement for the caller to have a certain level of authorization or identity as an active scorer.

3. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   - The sink code snippets provided show a pattern of enforcing system or active scorer status (`p0.enforceSystemOrIsActiveScorer(v1)`), checking if the caller is an active scorer, and then performing actions that require such authorization (e.g., `clearInternal()`, sending cache update callbacks).

4. **Analysis of the clearScores Method:**
   - The `clearScores` method also involves getting the calling UID (`INetworkScoreService$Stub.getCallingUid()`), which is a common step in authorizing the caller.
   - It checks conditions related to the service connection and app data, and then proceeds with clearing scores if certain conditions are met, including potentially checking the caller's status as an active scorer or enforcing system privileges.

Given these observations:

- The `clearScores` method involves authorization checks similar to those in the provided sink code snippets.
- The similar APIs (`disableScoring()V`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their need for system or signature-level permissions, suggesting that only authorized (system or specific signature) apps can call these methods.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the similarities with other APIs and the patterns observed in the code snippets, it's reasonable to conclude that the `clearScores` method should also have a similar access control level. This is because it appears to involve operations that require either system-level privileges or being an active scorer, aligning with the restrictions seen in the similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision ensures that only authorized entities (system apps or those with the appropriate signature-level permissions) can invoke the `clearScores` method, maintaining a consistent security posture with similar methods in the system.
