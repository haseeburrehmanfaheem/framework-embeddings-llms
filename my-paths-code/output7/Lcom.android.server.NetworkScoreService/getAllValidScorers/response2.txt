To determine the access control level for the `getAllValidScorers` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The `getAllValidScorers` method interacts with the package manager to query intent services and retrieves a list of valid scorers based on certain conditions.

1. **Analysis of the Code**: 
   - The method uses `PackageManager` to query services that match the intent action `"android.net.action.RECOMMEND_NETWORKS"`. This is a specific action related to network recommendations, which suggests it's dealing with system-level or signature-protected functionality.
   - It checks for the presence of certain metadata in the service's info (`"android.net.scoring.recommendation_service_label"` and `"android.net.wifi.use_open_wifi_package"`), indicating that the method is working with apps that provide network scoring or recommendation services. These operations typically require system-level permissions or are restricted to specific, trusted applications.
   - The creation of `NetworkScorerAppData` objects and their addition to a list for return also implies handling of potentially sensitive data related to network recommendations.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - Both provided similar APIs (`getActiveScorerPackage()Ljava/lang/String;`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to network scorers or recommenders typically require system-level permissions or are restricted to applications signed with the platform's signing key.
   - The similarity in functionality (dealing with network recommendations and scorer packages) implies that the security considerations for these APIs are similar.

3. **Access Control Level Decision**:
   - Given the interaction with system-level services, the handling of potentially sensitive data related to network scoring, and the comparison with similar APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getAllValidScorers` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - This is because allowing arbitrary applications to query and manipulate network scorer data could pose security risks or disrupt the intended functionality of network recommendation services.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `getAllValidScorers` method is `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it deals with system-level operations and potentially sensitive data related to network scoring and recommendations.
