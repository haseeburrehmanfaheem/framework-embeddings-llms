To determine the access control level for the `requestTileServiceListeningState` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method checks if `this.mBar` is equal to 0, and if so, it calls `requestTileServiceListeningState` on `this.mBar`, passing `p1` as an argument. This suggests that the method is interacting with a bar object (likely related to the status bar or quick settings) to request the listening state of a tile service.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code is a call to `requestTileServiceListeningState` on `this.mBar`, which directly relates to the functionality of interacting with tile services in the context of Android's status bar or quick settings.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **clickTile(ComponentName)**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its similarity score with `requestTileServiceListeningState` is 0.7325623631477356, indicating a high degree of similarity in their functionality or purpose. The code snippet for `clickTile` shows interaction with `this.mBar` to click on a QS tile, which implies system-level or signature-level access control due to its potential impact on the device's UI and functionality.
   - **cancelRequestAddTile(String)**: This method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, with a similarity score of 0.7211676239967346. Its code involves clearing a tile add request and canceling the request, which suggests operations that could affect system-level functionalities or require specific permissions.

Given these analyses:
- Both similar APIs (`clickTile` and `cancelRequestAddTile`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system-level permissions or signature-level permissions to execute. This is due to their potential to impact system functionality, specifically in the context of status bar or quick settings tiles.
- The `requestTileServiceListeningState` method interacts with system-level components (status bar or quick settings) and has a high degree of similarity with these APIs.

Therefore, considering the method's interaction with system components and its similarity to other methods that require system or signature-level access control, it is reasonable to assign the same level of access control to `requestTileServiceListeningState`.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
