To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method takes two parameters, a `String` and a `Bundle`, and its primary action is to call `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);` after clearing and then restoring the calling identity. This suggests that it's interacting with a notification delegate, likely related to handling user feedback on notifications.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - The first similar API, `onNotificationClick`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its method call to `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationClick(v3, v4, p1, p2);` involves interaction with the notification delegate but includes additional parameters.
   - The second similar API, `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationVisibilityChanged(p1, p2);`, which changes the visibility of notifications.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose a risk to the system or user data.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that require some level of access control but are generally considered safe when used appropriately.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can potentially harm the system or compromise user data if misused.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system or signature-protected methods, indicating a higher level of security requirement due to their potential impact on the system or sensitive operations.

Given the similarities in functionality and access control levels between `onNotificationClick` and `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`, both being classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that interacting with the notification delegate for significant events (like clicks, visibility changes, or feedback reception) requires a level of system or signature protection. This is likely due to the sensitive nature of these operations, which could impact system security or user privacy if not handled correctly.

**Conclusion**: The `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method interacts with the notification delegate in a manner similar to other methods classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`. Given its involvement in handling user feedback on notifications (a potentially sensitive operation), it's reasonable to infer that this method should also be protected at a similar level to prevent misuse or unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This classification ensures that the method is treated with the appropriate security considerations, aligning with the protection levels of similar APIs that interact with notification delegates for significant events.
