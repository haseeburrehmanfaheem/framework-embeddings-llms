To assign an access control level to the `onGlobalActionsHidden` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of `onGlobalActionsHidden`**:
   - The method `onGlobalActionsHidden` is called when global actions are hidden.
   - It checks if `mGlobalActionListener` is not null (or 0) before calling `onGlobalActionsDismissed()` on it.
   - This listener interface seems to be part of a mechanism that notifies about the state changes of global actions, which could include power menu or other system-level controls.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API provided is `onGlobalActionsShown()`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - This method is called when global actions are shown and also involves notifying a listener (`mGlobalActionListener`) about the event.
   - Both methods (`onGlobalActionsHidden` and `onGlobalActionsShown`) seem to be related to system-level functionality (showing or hiding global actions) and require interaction with components that might need specific permissions or access rights.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that both methods are related to system-level operations and the provided similar API (`onGlobalActionsShown`) has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that these operations are significant from a security perspective.
   - The `SYS_OR_SIG` level indicates that this operation either requires system privileges or is a signature-protected method, implying that not all applications can perform such actions freely.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the similarity in functionality and the context of global action notifications, it's reasonable to assign the same access control level to `onGlobalActionsHidden` as its similar counterpart.
   - Thus, the `onGlobalActionsHidden` method should have an access control level that reflects system or signature-level protection due to its interaction with potentially sensitive system operations.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
