To assign an access control level to the `onNotificationError` method, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The `onNotificationError` method has a similarity score of 0.8694642186164856 with the `onNotificationClick` API and 0.8659874200820923 with the `onNotificationClear` API. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Looking at the code snippet for `onNotificationError`, it calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationError` which is a sink, similar to the sinks in the provided similar APIs. The method also retrieves the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`, and then clears and restores the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5)`. This suggests that the method is handling notifications and interacting with the notification delegate, which requires a certain level of access control.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality with the provided APIs, and considering the access control levels assigned to those similar APIs, it's reasonable to assign the same access control level to `onNotificationError`.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
