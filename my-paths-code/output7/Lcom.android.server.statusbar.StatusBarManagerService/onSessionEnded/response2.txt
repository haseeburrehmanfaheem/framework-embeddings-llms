To determine the access control level for the `onSessionEnded` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**: The similar APIs provided are both named `onSessionStarted` with high similarity scores (0.9515604972839355 and 0.948765754699707) to the `onSessionEnded` method in question. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that methods related to session management (like starting or ending sessions) are considered sensitive and thus require a higher level of access control.

2. **Code Semantics**: The code snippets for both the `onSessionEnded` method and its similar APIs (`onSessionStarted`) involve getting listeners from a session-to-listeners map based on an integer session identifier, iterating over these listeners, and then calling a method (`onSessionEnded` or `onSessionStarted`) on each listener. This pattern indicates that these methods are involved in managing sessions and notifying listeners about changes in the session state.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided shows specific lines of code where potential security-sensitive operations occur, such as converting an integer to a value object (`Integer v4 = Integer.valueOf(p1);`), retrieving objects from maps based on session IDs, iterating over collections, and calling methods on listener objects. These operations themselves are not inherently dangerous but could be part of a larger flow that involves sensitive data or actions.

Given the high similarity between `onSessionEnded` and the provided `onSessionStarted` APIs, both in terms of their code structure and their roles in session management, it's reasonable to infer that `onSessionEnded` should have a similar access control level. The fact that `onSessionStarted` methods are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on the system's state or security, suggests that `onSessionEnded` should be treated similarly.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and code structure with other session management APIs that have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is logical to assign the same level of access control to the `onSessionEnded` method.
