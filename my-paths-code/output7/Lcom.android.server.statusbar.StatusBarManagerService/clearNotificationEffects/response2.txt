To determine the access control level for the `clearNotificationEffects` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `clearNotificationEffects` calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.clearEffects();` after checking the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and then restores it. This suggests that the method is performing an operation related to notification effects, which might require some level of access control to prevent unauthorized clearing of notifications.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code `this.mNotificationDelegate.clearEffects();` indicates that the actual effect clearing is delegated to another object (`mNotificationDelegate`). This implies a level of abstraction and potential security consideration since it involves interaction with system-level components or sensitive data (notifications).

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `onClearAllNotifications(I)V`, with high similarity scores (0.7257922291755676 and 0.7114325165748596). Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These similar APIs also interact with `this.mNotificationDelegate` (in their case, calling `onClearAll`), suggesting that operations related to clearing or managing notifications are subject to stricter access controls.

Given this information:

- The method interacts with system-level components (`mNotificationDelegate`) for clearing notification effects.
- Similar APIs that manage or clear notifications have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating a need for either system or signature-level permission to perform such actions securely.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the `clearNotificationEffects` method should also require a similar level of access control due to its interaction with potentially sensitive data (notifications) and system components. Therefore, assigning it an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` aligns with the security considerations observed in similar APIs.
