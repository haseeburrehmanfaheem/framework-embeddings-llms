To assign an access control level to the `suppressAmbientDisplay` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `suppressAmbientDisplay` method takes a boolean parameter `p1` and checks if `this.mBar` is equal to 0. If the condition is true, it calls the `suppressAmbientDisplay` method on `this.mBar`, passing `p1` as an argument.

2. **Analyzing Similar APIs**:
   - **onBiometricError(III)V**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7836151719093323 with `suppressAmbientDisplay`. It is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to its involvement in biometric error handling, which is sensitive.
   - **showPinningEscapeToast()V**: With a similarity score of 0.7699949145317078, this API is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This method seems less critical as it's related to showing a toast message, which is generally not sensitive.

3. **Determining Access Control for suppressAmbientDisplay**:
   - The `suppressAmbientDisplay` method interacts with the ambient display feature, which is related to the device's user interface and experience but does not directly involve sensitive data or actions that could compromise the system's security or privacy.
   - Given its functionality, it seems more aligned with methods that do not require high-level permissions like `SYS_OR_SIG` but are still part of the system's UI management.
   - However, since it deals with a specific aspect of device behavior (ambient display), which might be considered part of the device's normal operational features rather than sensitive or dangerous operations, its access control level could lean towards `NONE` or `NORMAL`, depending on how critical controlling ambient display is deemed.

Considering these points and given that `showPinningEscapeToast()V` has an access control level of `NONE` while being somewhat similar in structure but less critical in function, and `onBiometricError(III)V` requires `SYS_OR_SIG` due to its sensitive nature, the `suppressAmbientDisplay` method seems to fall into a category that does not require system or signature-level permissions but also isn't completely without any access control.

However, given the choices and considering that controlling ambient display might be considered part of normal device operation rather than something dangerous or requiring special system permissions, a reasonable assignment could lean towards `NORMAL`, as it reflects an operation that is part of the device's normal functionality but might still require some level of access control to prevent misuse.

Therefore, based on this analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice balances between recognizing the method's role in device operation and acknowledging that it doesn't deal with highly sensitive data or actions.
