To assign an access control level to the `onNotificationSmartReplySent` method, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs, specifically those that interact with the same sinks (in this case, `this.mNotificationDelegate`) and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `onNotificationSmartSuggestionsAdded` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these methods have a high similarity score with the `onNotificationSmartReplySent` method and share similar interactions with `this.mNotificationDelegate`. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that the API can be invoked by system or signature applications, suggesting it handles sensitive operations or data that should not be exposed to normal applications without proper authorization.

Given these points:
- The method `onNotificationSmartReplySent` interacts with `this.mNotificationDelegate`, which is similar to how the other two methods interact with their respective delegates.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The semantics of these APIs seem to involve notifications and delegate callbacks, which are typically restricted to system or signed applications to prevent misuse.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that `onNotificationSmartReplySent` should also be assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to its similarities with other APIs and the nature of its interactions.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
