To determine the access control level for the `onPanelHidden` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The code snippet for `onPanelHidden` shows that it calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onPanelHidden()` after clearing and then restoring the calling identity. This suggests that the method is interacting with the notification delegate, which is a sensitive component.

The sink code also reveals a call to `this.mNotificationDelegate.onPanelHidden()`, similar to the code snippet. However, it includes an additional check `p0.enforceStatusBarService();`, which implies that the method is enforcing status bar service permissions.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. `disable2ForUser`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7388530373573303 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows that it calls `p0.enforceStatusBar()` and then `p0.disableLocked()`, indicating that it enforces status bar permissions and performs some locked operation.
2. `disableForUser`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7357909679412842 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet is similar to `disable2ForUser`, with the main difference being the argument passed to `p0.disableLocked()`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require either system or signature-level permissions. Given the similarities between these APIs and `onPanelHidden`, it's likely that `onPanelHidden` also requires a similar level of access control.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the code snippet for `onPanelHidden` does not explicitly enforce any permissions like `p0.enforceStatusBar()` or `p0.enforceStatusBarService()`. Instead, it relies on clearing and restoring the calling identity, which might be sufficient to ensure that the method is called with the correct privileges.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the access control level for `onPanelHidden` should be lower than `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it does not explicitly enforce any permissions. Given the lack of explicit permission checks and the similarities with other APIs, a reasonable choice would be to assign an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
