To assign an access control level to the `remTile` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The `remTile` method takes a `ComponentName` object as a parameter and checks if `this.mBar` is equal to 0. If true, it calls the `remQsTile` method on `this.mBar`, passing the `ComponentName` object.

Looking at the similar APIs:

1. `clickTile`: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet is similar to `remTile`, where it checks if `this.mBar` is equal to 0 and then calls a method (`clickQsTile`) on `this.mBar`.
2. `addTile`: This method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet is slightly different, as it directly calls the `addQsTile` method on `this.mBar` without checking if `this.mBar` is equal to 0.

Given the similarities in code structure and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that the `remTile` method should also have a similar access control level. The semantics of these methods seem to be related to interacting with Quick Settings tiles, which might require system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `remTile` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
