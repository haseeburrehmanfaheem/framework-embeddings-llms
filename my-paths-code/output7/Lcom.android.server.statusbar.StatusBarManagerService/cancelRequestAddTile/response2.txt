To assign an access control level to the `cancelRequestAddTile` method, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `cancelRequestAddTile` method appears to manage requests related to tiles in a status bar. It checks if there is an ongoing request for adding a tile (`this.mCurrentRequestAddTilePackages.remove(p1)`), and if so, it cancels that request through another component or service (`this.mBar.cancelRequestAddTile(p1)`). The method also interacts with a `StatusBarManagerService` to clear tile add requests.

Given the similar APIs:

1. **remTile**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission to execute, as it involves removing tiles from the quick settings panel.
2. **clickTile**: Also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method handles clicking on a tile in the quick settings panel.

Both similar APIs interact closely with system-level UI components (status bar and quick settings), suggesting that direct manipulation or interaction with these components requires elevated permissions to maintain security and integrity of the system UI.

Considering the `cancelRequestAddTile` method's functionality:

- It involves direct interaction with a component (`this.mBar`) likely representing the status bar, which is a system-level UI element.
- The method affects the state of tile addition requests, which could be considered as altering system UI behavior or settings.
- The presence of a check for `this.mBar` being null before proceeding suggests a level of complexity and interaction with system services that may require elevated permissions.

Given these points, and comparing the functionality and access control levels of the similar APIs (`remTile` and `clickTile`), it's reasonable to conclude that the `cancelRequestAddTile` method should also have an access control level that reflects its potential impact on system-level UI components and services.

Therefore, considering the need for elevated permissions to interact with or modify system-level UI components securely:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This choice is based on the method's interaction with system-level components and services, similar to other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their potential impact on system integrity and security.
