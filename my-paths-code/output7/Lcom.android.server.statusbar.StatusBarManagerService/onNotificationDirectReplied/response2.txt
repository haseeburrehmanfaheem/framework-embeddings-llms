To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationDirectReplied` method, we should consider the similarities with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs, `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` and `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that methods interacting with the `mNotificationDelegate` in a similar manner are considered to require system or signature-level permissions. The reason for this could be due to the sensitive nature of notification handling, which may involve accessing private user data or modifying system settings.

Given the code snippet of `onNotificationDirectReplied`, it calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationDirectReplied(p1);` within a `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` block. This indicates that the method is handling notifications in a way that requires careful management of calling identities, likely to ensure security and integrity of the notification system.

Considering these points:

- The similarity in code structure and purpose with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.
- The interaction with `mNotificationDelegate`, which seems to be a critical component in handling notifications.
- The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`, suggesting a need to manage caller identities securely.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onNotificationDirectReplied` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` due to its interaction with sensitive system components and the necessity to protect user data and maintain system integrity.
