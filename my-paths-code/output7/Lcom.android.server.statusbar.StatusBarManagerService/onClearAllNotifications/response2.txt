To assign an access control level to the `onClearAllNotifications` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The `onClearAllNotifications` method has a similarity score of over 0.93 with two other APIs, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `onClearAllNotifications` method is likely to require a similar level of access control.

Looking at the code snippet for `onClearAllNotifications`, we see that it calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onClearAll(v3, v4, p1);`, which is similar to the code in the similar APIs. The `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` calls are used to get the UID and PID of the calling process, and `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5)` are used to clear and restore the calling identity, respectively. This suggests that the method is interacting with a privileged component (`mNotificationDelegate`) and is using binder calls to manage the calling identity.

Given this information, it appears that the `onClearAllNotifications` method requires a similar level of access control as the similar APIs, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This access control level indicates that the method can only be called by system or signature applications, which suggests that it performs a privileged operation.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
