To determine the access control level for the `expandNotificationsPanel` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths, both of which involve checking a condition related to the `mDisplayUiState` and then potentially calling `animateExpandNotificationsPanel()` on `this.mBar`. This suggests an interaction with UI elements, specifically related to the notification panel.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code mentions `enforceExpandStatusBar()`, which is a method call that appears in both of the similar APIs provided (`collapsePanels()` and `togglePanel()`). This indicates a pattern where certain status bar operations require permission checks or specific conditions to be met before execution.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **collapsePanels()V**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions. The code snippet for this API includes `enforceExpandStatusBar()` and a check with `canCloseSystemDialogs()`, suggesting that operations affecting the status bar or system dialogs are restricted.
   - **togglePanel()V**: Similar to `collapsePanels()`, `togglePanel()` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves `enforceExpandStatusBar()` and a condition check before toggling the panel, further reinforcing the idea that such operations are privileged.

Given these observations:

- The `expandNotificationsPanel` method interacts with system UI elements (the notification panel) in a manner similar to the provided APIs (`collapsePanels()` and `togglePanel()`).
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which is typically required for operations that can affect system behavior or require specific permissions.
- The presence of `enforceExpandStatusBar()` in the sink code, which is also found in the similar APIs, suggests a pattern of requiring system-level checks before performing certain status bar-related actions.

Based on these considerations, it's reasonable to conclude that the `expandNotificationsPanel` method should have an access control level that matches those of its similar APIs, especially given the involvement of system UI elements and operations that likely require specific permissions or conditions.

**Access Control Level:**
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
This decision aligns with the patterns observed in the similar APIs and reflects the need for privileged access when interacting with certain system UI components.
