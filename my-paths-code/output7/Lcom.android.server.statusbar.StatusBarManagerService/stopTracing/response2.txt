To determine the access control level for the `stopTracing` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The `stopTracing` method has a simple conditional statement that checks if `this.mBar` is equal to 0. If true, it sets `this.mTracingEnabled` to 0 and calls `this.mBar.stopTracing()`. The sink code includes two lines: `this.mBar.stopTracing()` and `this.mTracingEnabled = 0`.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. `isTracing()Z`: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and simply returns the value of `this.mTracingEnabled`. Since it only reads a variable without modifying any state or performing sensitive operations, its access control level is justified as `NONE`.

2. `startTracing()V`: This method also has an access control level of `NONE`. It checks if `this.mBar` is equal to 0 and then starts tracing by calling `this.mBar.startTracing()` and sets `this.mTracingEnabled` to 1. Similar to `stopTracing`, it modifies the state but does not seem to perform any sensitive or dangerous operations.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the semantics of the `stopTracing` method, which stops tracing by calling `this.mBar.stopTracing()` and updates the tracing enabled state, we can infer that this operation is not sensitive or dangerous. It appears to be a standard operation related to managing the tracing state, similar to starting or checking the tracing status.

Therefore, based on the code analysis and comparison with similar APIs, the access control level for the `stopTracing` method should also be `NONE`, as it does not involve any operations that would require higher security clearance such as accessing sensitive data, modifying system settings, or performing actions that could potentially harm the system or user data.
