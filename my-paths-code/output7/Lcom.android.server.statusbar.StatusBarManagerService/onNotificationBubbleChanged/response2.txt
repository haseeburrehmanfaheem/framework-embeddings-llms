To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationBubbleChanged` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are:

1. `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`: This API has a high similarity score of 0.8615913391113281 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows a call to `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationVisibilityChanged(p1, p2)`, which is similar to the sink code in `onNotificationBubbleChanged`, where it calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationBubbleChanged(p1, p2, p3)`.

2. `onBubbleMetadataFlagChanged`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8472970724105835 and is also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves a call to `this.mNotificationDelegate.onBubbleMetadataFlagChanged(p1, p2)`, showing a similar pattern of delegating the call to `this.mNotificationDelegate`.

Both of these similar APIs have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. The `onNotificationBubbleChanged` method follows a similar pattern by calling `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationBubbleChanged(p1, p2, p3)`, which suggests that it should be assigned the same access control level as the similar APIs.

Additionally, the use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` in the `onNotificationBubbleChanged` method indicates that the method is handling interactions that require careful management of the calling identity, which further supports assigning a more restricted access control level like `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these considerations, the final access control level for the `onNotificationBubbleChanged` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
