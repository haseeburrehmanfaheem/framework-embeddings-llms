To determine the access control level for the `onSessionStarted` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onSessionStarted` method takes two parameters, an integer `p1` and an `InstanceId` object `p2`. It checks if the integer value is contained within a set named `ALL_SESSIONS` provided by `StatusBarManager`. If it is, the method proceeds to notify listeners associated with this session ID.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with session listeners and an instance of `mSessionMonitor`, suggesting that the method's primary function is to start a session and notify relevant parties about this event.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `onSessionEnded` with high similarity scores (0.9515604972839355 and 0.948765754699707). 
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - The code for these similar APIs shows a pattern of retrieving listeners based on a session ID and then notifying them about the session ending, which is analogous to the logic in `onSessionStarted` but for ending sessions instead.

Given this analysis:

- **Similarity in Functionality**: The functionality of starting or ending a session and notifying listeners implies that these operations are part of a controlled environment, likely requiring specific permissions to manage sessions effectively.
  
- **Access Control Level of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs (`onSessionEnded`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that managing sessions (either starting or ending them) is considered a sensitive operation that should be restricted to system or signature-level accesses.

- **Nature of the Operation**: Starting a session can potentially impact system resources and security, as it might involve setting up environments for applications or services to run. Thus, controlling who can initiate such operations is crucial.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for the `onSessionStarted` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the levels assigned to similar session management APIs. This ensures that only authorized system components or applications signed with the platform key can start sessions, maintaining security and integrity.
