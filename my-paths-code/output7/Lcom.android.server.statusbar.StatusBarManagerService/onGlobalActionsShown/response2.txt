To determine the access control level for the `onGlobalActionsShown` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onGlobalActionsShown` method checks if `mGlobalActionListener` is not null (or 0) and then calls `onGlobalActionsShown` on it. This implies an interaction with a listener that has been set up elsewhere in the codebase, likely to notify about global actions being shown.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code reinforces this behavior by specifically highlighting the call to `this.mGlobalActionListener.onGlobalActionsShown();`. This suggests that the method's primary purpose is to notify listeners about an event (global actions being shown), which doesn't inherently suggest a dangerous or sensitive operation from the perspective of access control.

3. **Similar API Analysis**: The similar API, `onGlobalActionsHidden()V`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method likely notifies listeners that global actions are being hidden, which is symmetric to the action of showing them. Given the similarity in purpose (notifying about a state change related to global actions) and assuming both methods are used in similar contexts within the system, it suggests that both could be subject to similar access control considerations.

4. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not pose any security risk.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that require some level of protection but are generally safe for most users.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can cause harm if misused, such as those accessing sensitive data or modifying system settings.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Methods that should only be accessible by system components or applications with a specific signature, typically due to their potential impact on the system's integrity or user privacy.

Given these considerations:
- The method does not seem to access sensitive information directly nor perform an action that could inherently cause harm if misused.
- Its purpose is more aligned with notifying about system events rather than performing critical operations.
- However, considering its similarity to `onGlobalActionsHidden` which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` level and the fact that controlling global actions might be restricted to certain applications or system components for consistency and security reasons, it's reasonable to consider a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `onGlobalActionsShown` method seems to align with the `SYS_OR_SIG` level due to its potential implications on system behavior and user experience, assuming that controlling or being notified about global actions should be restricted to trusted components or applications.
