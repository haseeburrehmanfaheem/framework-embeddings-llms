To assign an access control level to the `addTile` method, we should consider its similarity to other APIs that interact with the same sinks (`this.mBar.addQsTile(p1);`) and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `clickTile` and `remTile`, both of which have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given that:
- The `addTile` method modifies system settings by adding a tile, which could potentially impact the system's functionality or user experience.
- Both `clickTile` and `remTile` methods, with similar functionality (interacting with tiles), are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require significant permissions, likely due to their ability to alter system settings or interact with sensitive components.

Considering these points, it is reasonable to infer that the `addTile` method should also have a high level of access control because it directly affects system functionality by adding a new tile. Therefore, based on its similarity in functionality and impact to `clickTile` and `remTile`, `addTile` should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
