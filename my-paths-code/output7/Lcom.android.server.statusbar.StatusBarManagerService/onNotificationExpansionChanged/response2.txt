To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`: This has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `onNotificationError`: This also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these methods interact with the `this.mNotificationDelegate` object, similar to `onNotificationExpansionChanged`. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that the method can be invoked by system or signature applications, suggesting it requires a certain level of privilege.

Given that both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level and considering the interaction with `this.mNotificationDelegate`, which seems to be a common pattern among these notification-related methods, it's reasonable to infer that `onNotificationExpansionChanged` should also have a similar access control requirement. 

The method does not seem to perform any operations that would categorize it as `DANGEROUS` (which typically involves direct access to sensitive data or capabilities that could be used for malicious purposes), nor does it appear to be so basic as to warrant `NONE` (which usually implies no specific permissions are required). The `NORMAL` level is generally associated with APIs that require some form of permission but are not as restrictive as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the similarities and the nature of the operations performed by `onNotificationExpansionChanged`, it is logical to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with its similar APIs.
