To determine the access control level for the `clearStatuses` API, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `clearStatuses` API interacts with the following sinks:

1. `DataManager`: It accesses the data manager instance using `PeopleService.-$$Nest$fgetmDataManager(this.this$0)`.
2. `PackageData`: It retrieves package data using `DataManager.getPackage(p1, p2)`.
3. `ConversationStore`: It gets the conversation store from the package data using `v15.getConversationStore()`.
4. `ConversationInfo`: It retrieves or creates a conversation info instance using `v14.getConversation(p3)` and `new ConversationInfo$Builder(v17)`.
5. `mCurrStatuses`: It clears the current statuses map using `this.mCurrStatuses.clear()`.

The API also calls `v14.addOrUpdate(v29)` to update the conversation store, which is similar to the `addOrUpdateStatus` APIs provided as similar examples.

Now, let's compare the access control levels of the similar APIs:

* Both `addOrUpdateStatus` APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Given the similarities between the `clearStatuses` API and the `addOrUpdateStatus` APIs in terms of their interactions with the same sinks (e.g., `DataManager`, `ConversationStore`, `ConversationInfo`) and their functionality (e.g., updating conversation stores), it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `clearStatuses`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude that the access control level for the `clearStatuses` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is informed by the similarities in code structure and functionality between `clearStatuses` and the provided similar APIs, as well as the need to ensure consistent access control across related APIs.
