Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `getStatuses` API.

The `getStatuses` API has a similarity score of 0.9111603498458862 with the `clearStatuses` API and 0.9094337821006775 with the `clearStatus` API, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `getStatuses` API is likely to require a similar level of access control.

Upon reviewing the code snippets for the `getStatuses` API, we can see that it interacts with the `IActivityManager` service, which is a system-level service, and also uses the `handleIncomingUser` method, which is used to check the caller's identity. This indicates that the API is handling sensitive information and requires a certain level of access control.

Additionally, the sink code provided shows that the API is returning a list of statuses, which could potentially contain sensitive information.

Given these factors, it is likely that the `getStatuses` API requires an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, similar to the `clearStatuses` and `clearStatus` APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getStatuses` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
