To assign an access control level to the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippet for the `onReceive` method is:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
This method creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and starts it. The sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
We are given two similar APIs with a similarity score of 1.0, both having the same access control level: `NONE`. Their code snippets are identical to the sink code of the `onReceive` method.

Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and their code snippets are identical to the sink code of the `onReceive` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
