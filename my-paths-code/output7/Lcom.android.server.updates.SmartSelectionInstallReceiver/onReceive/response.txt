To identify potential sinks in the provided code snippet of the `onReceive` method, we need to follow the specified positive and negative rules.

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
            "v1.start();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Here's a breakdown of why these instructions are considered part of a sink:

1. **Object Creation with Data Flow from API Parameters**: The `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object is created using the parameters `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`. This follows one of the positive rules because it involves data flow from the API parameters to the creation of a new object.

2. **Method Invocation on Class Instances**: The `start()` method is invoked on the newly created instance `v1`. Although this method's name doesn't directly indicate sensitivity, its invocation in conjunction with the creation of an object that uses the API parameters suggests it could be part of a data flow that requires access control.

This sequence of instructions forms a coherent set because the output (or result) of creating the `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` instance is directly used as the input for the method invocation (`v1.start()`), showing a clear dataflow link between them. 

Given the provided code, no other instructions can be identified that follow the positive rules or indicate sensitivity based on the negative rules. Thus, this single array in 'Sinks' represents all potential sinks found in the `onReceive` method of the API.
