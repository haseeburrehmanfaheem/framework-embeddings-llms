To determine the access control level for the `storeResourceMap` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The provided similar APIs are `restoreResourceMap(I)V` and `clearResourceMap(I)V`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to resource maps are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions to execute.

2. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The `storeResourceMap` method takes an integer parameter `p1`. If `p1` is 0, it calls a series of `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeXXX` methods to update frontend resources and counts.
   - The sink code provided confirms that these operations involve replacing or updating resource maps and counts, which are critical for managing system resources.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the sensitivity of resource management operations and the similarity in behavior with `restoreResourceMap` and `clearResourceMap`, it's reasonable to conclude that `storeResourceMap` should also have a restrictive access control level.
   - The fact that both similar APIs (`restoreResourceMap` and `clearResourceMap`) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests that operations affecting resource maps require protection against unauthorized access, aligning with system or signature-level permissions.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the behavior of `storeResourceMap`, its similarity to other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, and the importance of protecting resource management operations, it's logical to assign `storeResourceMap` an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
