To determine the access control level for the `clearResourceMap` method, let's analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The `clearResourceMap` method takes an integer parameter `p1`. If `p1` is 0, it resets several resource maps (`mFrontendResources`, `mFrontendExistingNums`, `mFrontendUsedNums`, `mFrontendMaxUsableNums`) by calling `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeResourceMap` and `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts` methods with a value of 0. This essentially clears or resets the resource mappings to their initial state.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar APIs provided are `restoreResourceMap` and `storeResourceMap`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 
   - **Restore Resource Map**: This method restores the resource maps from backup resources, implying a recovery or rollback operation.
   - **Store Resource Map**: Conversely, this method stores the current state of resource maps into backup variables, preparing for potential later restoration.

3. **Access Control Determination**:
   - Given that `clearResourceMap` directly modifies critical system resources (like frontend resources and their counts) without necessarily requiring user or app-level permissions, it suggests a need for a higher level of access control.
   - The operations performed by `clearResourceMap`, `restoreResourceMap`, and `storeResourceMap` are all related to managing system resources in a way that could impact system stability or security if not properly controlled. 
   - Since `clearResourceMap` can potentially reset critical resource allocations, it's reasonable to consider it as sensitive as restoring or storing these maps, which already have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the potential impact on system resources and considering the similarity in functionality with `restoreResourceMap` and `storeResourceMap`, it is logical to conclude that `clearResourceMap` should also have a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized or unintended modifications to system resource allocations.

The final answer is: 
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
