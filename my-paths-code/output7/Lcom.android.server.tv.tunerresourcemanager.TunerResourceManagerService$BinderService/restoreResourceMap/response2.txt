To determine the access control level for the `restoreResourceMap` method, we should analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs, namely `storeResourceMap` and `clearResourceMap`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

1. **Functionality Analysis**: The `restoreResourceMap` method appears to restore resource mappings from backup variables (`mFrontendResourcesBackup`, `mFrontendExistingNumsBackup`, `mFrontendUsedNumsBackup`, `mFrontendMaxUsableNumsBackup`) to their active counterparts (`mFrontendResources`, `mFrontendExistingNums`, `mFrontendUsedNums`, `mFrontendMaxUsableNums`) when the input parameter `p1` is 0. This operation involves internal state management of resource allocations, which seems critical for system functionality and stability.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **storeResourceMap**: This method stores the current resource map into backup variables. It has a symmetry with `restoreResourceMap` in terms of accessing and modifying the same set of variables but in the opposite direction (storing instead of restoring). Given its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that such operations are considered sensitive or critical.
   - **clearResourceMap**: This method clears resource allocations by replacing them with zeros. Like `storeResourceMap` and `restoreResourceMap`, it directly affects the system's resource management state. Its `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level further indicates that direct manipulation of these resources is restricted to system or signature-level access.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**: Given the similarities in functionality and the critical nature of managing resource allocations, it's reasonable to conclude that `restoreResourceMap` should have a similar access control level as its counterparts. The method's impact on system state and potential sensitivity of resource management operations align with the rationale behind assigning `SYS_OR_SIG` to related methods.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of its functionality and comparison with similar APIs, the appropriate access control level for the `restoreResourceMap` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This conclusion stems from the method's critical role in system resource management and the established precedent by similar methods within the same domain.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
