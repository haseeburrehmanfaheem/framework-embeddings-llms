Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getSystemRoutes` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getSystemRoutes` method appears to be interacting with system-level media routing functionality, which suggests that it may require some level of access control. The method's code snippet shows that it is using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v6)`, which indicates that it is dealing with inter-process communication (IPC) and potentially sensitive data.

The similar APIs provided offer insights into the expected access control levels:

1. `getSystemSessionInfo()`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9395541548728943 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippet for this API shows that it is accessing system-level media routing information, which suggests that it requires a higher level of access control.
2. `requestSetVolume(Landroid/media/IMediaRouterClient;Ljava/lang/String;I)V`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8003705143928528 and an access control level of `NONE`. The code snippet for this API shows that it is sending a message to a handler, which does not seem to require any specific access control.

Considering the similarities between `getSystemRoutes` and `getSystemSessionInfo()`, it is likely that `getSystemRoutes` also requires a higher level of access control. However, since `getSystemRoutes` is returning a list of system routes, which may not be as sensitive as session information, the access control level might not be as restrictive as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getSystemRoutes` method. This level suggests that the method requires some level of access control, but it is not as sensitive as system-level session information.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
