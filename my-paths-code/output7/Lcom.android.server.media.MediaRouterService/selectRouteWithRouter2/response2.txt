Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `selectRouteWithRouter2` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `selectRouteWithRouter2` method interacts with the `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl` class and calls methods like `selectRouteWithRouter2Locked` and `sendMessage`. These interactions suggest that the method is related to media routing and may require some level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of media routes.

Looking at the similar APIs, we have:

* `deselectRouteWithRouter2`: This method has a similarity score of 0.9327 and an access control level of NONE. Its code simply calls `this.mService2.deselectRouteWithRouter2(p1, p2, p3)`, which is similar to the sink code in `selectRouteWithRouter2`.
* `transferToRouteWithRouter2`: This method has a similarity score of 0.8934 and an access control level of NONE. Its code calls `this.mService2.transferToRouteWithRouter2(p1, p2, p3)`, which is also similar to the sink code in `selectRouteWithRouter2`.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, it suggests that the `selectRouteWithRouter2` method may not require strict access control. The method's interactions with the `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl` class and its similarity to other methods with NONE access control level imply that it can be assigned a relatively permissive access control level.

However, considering the method's potential impact on media routing and the fact that it interacts with system services, assigning an access control level of NONE might be too permissive. A more reasonable approach would be to assign an access control level of NORMAL, which balances the need for some level of protection with the method's relatively benign nature.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `selectRouteWithRouter2` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
