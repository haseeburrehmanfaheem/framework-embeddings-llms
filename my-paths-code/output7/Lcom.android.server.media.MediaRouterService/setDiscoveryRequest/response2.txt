To determine the access control level for the `setDiscoveryRequest` method, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Behavior of `setDiscoveryRequest`:**
   - The method modifies internal state related to media routing discovery by setting route types (`MediaRouterService$ClientRecord.mRouteTypes`) and active scan status (`MediaRouterService$ClientRecord.mActiveScan`).
   - It also sends an empty message via a handler (`MediaRouterService$UserRecord.mHandler.sendEmptyMessage(3)`), which likely triggers further processing or updates related to the media router service.
   - The method checks for `MediaRouterService$ClientRecord.mTrusted` and handles the case when the client record is not found, suggesting some level of access control or validation.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`setSelectedRoute`:** This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It updates the selected route ID for a client and sends messages to trigger further processing. The similarity score with `setDiscoveryRequest` is high (0.8693516254425049), indicating that these methods share significant functionality, especially in how they interact with client records and handlers.
   - **`registerClientGroupId`:** This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute. It updates group IDs for clients and manages their membership in groups. The similarity score is lower (0.79502934217453) compared to `setSelectedRoute`, but still indicates a notable resemblance in functionality, particularly in modifying client records.

Given the above analysis:
- **`setDiscoveryRequest`** modifies internal state related to media router discovery and interacts with handlers, similar to `setSelectedRoute`. However, it also involves checks that could imply some level of trust or validation (e.g., `MediaRouterService$ClientRecord.mTrusted`), which might suggest a need for more restricted access compared to `NONE`.
- The method does not seem to require system-level permissions directly like `registerClientGroupId`, but its functionality is closer to `setSelectedRoute` in terms of updating client records and interacting with the media router service.

Considering these points, **the most appropriate access control level for `setDiscoveryRequest` seems to be `NORMAL`**. This choice reflects the method's need for some level of access control (given its interaction with internal state and handlers) without requiring system or signature-level permissions directly.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision balances the need for security with the functional requirements of media router service management, aligning with the observed behavior and comparisons to similar APIs.
