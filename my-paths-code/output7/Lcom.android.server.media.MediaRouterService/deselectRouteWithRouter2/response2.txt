To determine the access control level for the `deselectRouteWithRouter2` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve null checks on the input parameters `p1` (router) and `p3` (route), followed by a check on the string parameter `p2`. If `p2` is empty, it proceeds to clear the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and then interacts with `mAllRouterRecords` based on whether an entry for the router's binder exists. The second path includes sending a message via a handler if such an entry exists.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve checking if `p2` is empty and, if so, calling another method (`deselectRouteWithRouter2Locked`) after clearing the calling identity, or directly calling `deselectRouteWithRouter2` on `mService2`. This indicates interaction with potentially sensitive operations that require careful access control.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `deselectRouteWithManager`: Has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it does not impose any specific restrictions beyond what the system normally enforces. Its code simply calls `deselectRouteWithManager` on `mService2`.
   - `selectRouteWithRouter2`: Also has an access control level of `NONE`. It calls `selectRouteWithRouter2` on `mService2`.

Given this analysis, we observe that:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting they are not considered to pose significant security risks or require elevated permissions.
- The operations within `deselectRouteWithRouter2` involve clearing calling identity and interacting with router records, which might suggest some level of sensitivity but does not necessarily imply a need for elevated permissions like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The method's functionality seems to be part of the media routing service's internal logic, managing routes without directly accessing sensitive user data or system resources that would typically require stricter access control.

Considering these points, it appears that `deselectRouteWithRouter2` does not perform operations that would necessitate an elevated access control level beyond what is normally enforced by the system. Therefore, its access control level should align with those of the similar APIs provided.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
