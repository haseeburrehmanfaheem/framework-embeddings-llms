To determine the access control level for the `startScan` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The `startScan` method has two paths with depth 2. Both involve checking if a manager record exists and then either returning immediately without further action or calling `startScan()` on the existing record after checking its presence. This interaction involves binder operations (`Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`) which are typically used to perform actions under a different identity, often for security reasons.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves calls to `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.startScanLocked(p1)` and `this.mService2.startScan(p1)`, indicating that the method is related to media routing services and possibly affects device settings or states related to media playback and routing.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are mentioned: `stopScan(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)V`. Both have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - The code for these similar APIs also involves binder operations (`Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`) and interactions with media router services (`MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.stopScanLocked(p1)` and `this.mService2.stopScan(p1)`).

Given the above points:

- **Security Implications**: The method seems to be involved in managing media routing, which could potentially impact system settings or user experience but does not seem to directly access sensitive data (like location, contacts, etc.) that would require higher access control levels.
  
- **Similarity with Other APIs**: The similar APIs (`stopScan`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to media routing management might not be considered dangerous or requiring special system or signature permissions.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate access control level for the `startScan` method would likely be `NORMAL`. This is because it involves managing a device's state (in this case, starting a scan for media routing purposes) but does not appear to directly interact with sensitive user data or require dangerous permissions. The use of binder operations suggests some level of system interaction, but given the similarity with other APIs labeled as `NONE`, and considering the context provided, `NORMAL` seems a reasonable choice.
