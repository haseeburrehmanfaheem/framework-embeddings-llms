Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `selectRouteWithManager` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `selectRouteWithManager` method has two paths with depth 2, but both paths involve checking if the `manager` and `route` are not null, and then performing some operations. The sink code also involves calling `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.selectRouteWithManagerLocked` after clearing the calling identity.

Comparing this to the similar APIs:

* `deselectRouteWithManager`: This method has a similarity score of 0.89155513048172 and an access control level of NONE. It also checks for null `manager` and performs some operations.
* `transferToRouteWithRouter2`: This method has a similarity score of 0.8397693634033203 and an access control level of NONE. It checks for null `router` and `route`, and then performs some operations after clearing the calling identity.

Given the similarities in code structure and the access control levels of the similar APIs, it appears that the `selectRouteWithManager` method does not require any special permissions or access control beyond what is already implemented (e.g., checking for null objects). Therefore, the access control level for this method should be NONE.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
