Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage` method to determine its access control level.

The method interacts with sensitive data, such as routing session information and media routes, which are typically protected by system or signature-level permissions. The similar APIs provided, `getSystemSessionInfo()Landroid/media/RoutingSessionInfo;`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system-level or signature-level permissions to access.

The sink code provided shows that the method is building a `RoutingSessionInfo` object using sensitive data, such as the device route ID and selected routes. This suggests that the method is handling sensitive information that requires protection.

Given the similarities between the `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage` method and the provided similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
