To determine the access control level for the `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The given API uses `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity(v4);`, which suggests that it is interacting with a system service or performing an operation that requires a clean calling identity. This is similar to the behavior observed in the two provided similar APIs, `setVcnConfig` and `clearVcnConfig`, both of which also use `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`.

However, the key difference lies in their assigned access control levels: `SYS_OR_SIG` for `setVcnConfig` and `NONE` for `clearVcnConfig`. To decide on the appropriate access control level for `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, we need to consider what these levels imply:

- `SYS_OR_SIG`: This suggests that the API is either system-internal or requires a signature-level permission, indicating it performs operations that are sensitive or require higher privileges.
- `NONE`: Indicates that the operation does not require any specific permissions beyond what's normally accessible.

Given that `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` involves removing a listener related to network policy, which could potentially affect system behavior or security, and considering its similarity with `setVcnConfig` (which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`), it seems reasonable to infer that this operation might require some form of elevated access.

However, the presence of `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity` alone does not necessarily dictate a specific access control level without more context about what removing such a listener entails in terms of system impact or security. The similarity with `clearVcnConfig`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, suggests that perhaps this operation might not be as sensitive, especially since it's primarily concerned with removing a listener rather than directly configuring the system.

Given these considerations and without explicit details on the sensitivity of the operation beyond its code snippet, one might lean towards assigning an access control level based on the operational similarity and the implications of using `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`. However, since this method seems to be more closely related to management operations that don't directly imply system or signature-level permissions are necessary (unlike `setVcnConfig`), but still involves interaction with system services indirectly through the binder mechanism, a cautious approach would be to consider it as potentially requiring some level of access control.

But, considering the information and similarities provided, the most likely alignment based on the given similar APIs' behavior and access levels is that this operation might not necessarily require `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions but could still be considered under `NORMAL` or `NONE`, depending on how sensitive the removal of a network policy listener is deemed to be. Given the context clues from similar methods, especially `clearVcnConfig` having an access control level of `NONE`, and without explicit evidence that this operation is significantly more sensitive:

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
