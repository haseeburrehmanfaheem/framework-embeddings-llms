To determine the access control level for the `getProgress` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getProgress` method calculates and returns a progress value based on `completeSize` and the size of `mDexoptCommands`. It does not seem to access or modify sensitive data directly.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippet involves calculating the size of `mDexoptCommands` and using it to compute a progress value. This operation is related to internal state management rather than accessing external resources or sensitive information.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isDone()Z**: This method checks if `mDexoptCommands` is empty, with an access control level of NONE. The similarity score with `getProgress` is high (0.8091840744018555), indicating that both methods are likely related to checking or managing the state of `mDexoptCommands`.
   - **nextDexoptCommand()Ljava/lang/String;**: Although this method has a slightly lower similarity score (0.7775697112083435) and involves removing an element from `mDexoptCommands`, its access control level is also NONE. This suggests that operations related to `mDexoptCommands` might not require elevated permissions.

Given these points, the `getProgress` method appears to manage or report on internal state without accessing sensitive data, making external requests, or performing dangerous operations. Therefore, based on the similarity with other methods and the nature of its operation, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level similar to those of the compared APIs.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
