Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `cleanup` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `cleanup` method appears to be responsible for cleaning up resources after a dexopt operation. It checks the available storage space, logs metrics, and resets certain variables. The method does not seem to perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions.

The similar APIs, `nextDexoptCommand()Ljava/lang/String;`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with storage space and logging, but they do not seem to pose a significant security risk.

Considering the semantics of the `cleanup` method and its similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `cleanup` method should be `NONE`. This is because the method does not perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions, and its functionality is similar to other methods with an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
