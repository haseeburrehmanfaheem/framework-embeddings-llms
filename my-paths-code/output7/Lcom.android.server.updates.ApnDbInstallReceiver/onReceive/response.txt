To analyze this API and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, let's break down the code:

```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```

Here are the observations and analysis based on the rules given:

- The method `onReceive` is invoked with parameters `Context p1` and `Intent p2`.
- An object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created, taking parameters `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`. This creation has a data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and `p1`) to the new object.
- The method `start()` is invoked on the newly created object `v1`.

Considering the positive rules:
1. Method invocation: The creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its `start()` method have a data flow link, as `start()` operates on the object created with API parameters.
2. Object creation: `new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1)` follows one of the positive rules because it is created with data flow from the API parameters (`p2` and `p1`).
3. There are no field get/set cases directly in this code snippet.

Given these observations, we can identify a potential sink set that includes object creation and method invocation linked by data flow:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
        "v1.start();"
    ]
]
}
```

This JSON represents the coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink, with `p2` and `p1` influencing the creation of `v1`, which then directly influences the invocation of `start()` on it.
