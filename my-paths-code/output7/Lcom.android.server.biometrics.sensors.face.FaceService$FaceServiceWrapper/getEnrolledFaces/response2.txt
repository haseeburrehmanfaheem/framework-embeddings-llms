To determine the access control level for the `getEnrolledFaces` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `getEnrolledFaces` method iterates over a list of service providers (`mServiceProviders`) and checks if each provider contains a specific sensor. If a provider is found, it returns an empty list or calls another method to get enrolled faces. The sink code suggests that the method interacts with service providers and sensors.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `createTestSession`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9708389043807983 and an access control level of NORMAL. Its code also iterates over service providers and checks for sensor presence, similar to `getEnrolledFaces`.
2. `resetLockout`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9639187455177307 and an access control level of NORMAL. Although its code is slightly different, it still interacts with service providers and sensors.

Given the similarities in code structure and interaction with service providers and sensors, it's reasonable to assign an access control level of NORMAL to the `getEnrolledFaces` method. This level indicates that the method performs a standard operation without posing significant risks or requiring special permissions.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarities with other APIs and the method's interactions with service providers and sensors, which do not suggest any dangerous or sensitive operations that would require a higher access control level.
