To determine the access control level for the `getSensorProperties` method, we need to analyze its code snippets, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getSensorProperties` method iterates through a list of service providers (`mServiceProviders`) and checks if any provider contains a specific sensor based on the input string `p2`. If such a provider is found, it attempts to retrieve properties related to that sensor. This operation seems to be about querying or retrieving information rather than modifying system settings or accessing sensitive data directly.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets involve getting a provider for a specific sensor (`getProviderForSensor`) and then performing actions based on the presence of this provider. These operations are related to interacting with sensors, which could be considered a normal operation in the context of an Android application, especially one dealing with face recognition or similar functionalities.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `isHardwareDetected` API has a similarity score close to 1, indicating it's very similar to `getSensorProperties`. It checks if hardware is detected for a given sensor and has an access control level of `NORMAL`.
   - The `resetLockout` API, despite having a slightly lower similarity score, also interacts with sensors (or their providers) and has an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Given these observations:
- The operations performed by `getSensorProperties` are related to querying sensor properties, which is a functionality that doesn't inherently suggest dangerous or system/signature-level access.
- Similar APIs (`isHardwareDetected` and `resetLockout`) have been assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`, indicating that interacting with sensors in this manner does not require elevated permissions beyond what's considered normal for such operations.

Therefore, the access control level for the `getSensorProperties` API should be aligned with these observations, suggesting a level that reflects standard, non-elevated access for sensor-related queries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }}$
