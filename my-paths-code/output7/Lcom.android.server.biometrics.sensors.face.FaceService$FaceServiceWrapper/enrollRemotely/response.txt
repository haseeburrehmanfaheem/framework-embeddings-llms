Based on the provided code and the rules specified, here is the analysis of potential sinks:

Since there are no method invocations (other than the return statement), field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules within this API, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink for small APIs.

Here is the JSON output with the identified sink:
```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "public long enrollRemotely(int p1, IBinder p2, byte[] p3, IFaceServiceReceiver p4, String p5, [I p6){",
      "return -1;"
    ]
  ]
}
```
However, since the return statement does not directly relate to any of the input parameters (p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6), and there are no other operations that process these inputs, this API might be considered as having low sensitivity.

It is also worth noting that the API seems incomplete or a stub, as it does not perform any actual enrollment operation but simply returns -1. Therefore, in a real-world scenario, the actual implementation of this method would need to be analyzed for potential sinks.
