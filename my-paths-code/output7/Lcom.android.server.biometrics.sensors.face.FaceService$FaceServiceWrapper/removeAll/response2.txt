To determine the access control level for the `removeAll` method, we should analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeAll` method appears to interact with sensor properties and service providers, iterating through lists of these entities and calling a `scheduleRemoveAll` method on them. This interaction suggests that the method is involved in managing or removing certain types of data or services related to face recognition or sensing.

Given the similarity scores and access control levels of the similar APIs:

1. **removeAll(Landroid/os/IBinder;ILandroid/hardware/fingerprint/IFingerprintServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;)V** with a similarity score of 0.8150778412818909 and an access control level of **NORMAL**. This API is related to fingerprint service, which, like face recognition, involves biometric data. The operations (e.g., scheduling removal) seem comparable in terms of sensitivity.

2. **cancelEnrollment(Landroid/os/IBinder;J)V** with a similarity score of 0.7784061431884766 and an access control level of **NORMAL**. This method is involved in canceling enrollment, presumably related to face recognition or similar biometric services. It also interacts with sensor properties and involves operations that could impact user data or service functionality.

Considering the code snippets provided for these similar APIs, they all seem to involve sensitive operations (removal, cancellation of enrollments) that could potentially affect user data or privacy. However, none of them appear to directly manipulate critical system resources or require privileges that would categorize them as **DANGEROUS** or **SYS_OR_SIG**.

Given this analysis and the provided information:

- The `removeAll` method does not seem to pose an immediate danger in terms of accessing or manipulating sensitive data without authorization (which would be characteristic of **DANGEROUS**).
- It also doesn't appear to require system-level privileges or signals that would categorize it as **SYS_OR_SIG**.
- The operations performed are somewhat similar to those in the provided APIs with a **NORMAL** access control level, suggesting that while the method involves some form of data or service management, it does so within boundaries that do not necessitate higher levels of access control.

Therefore, based on the similarity scores and the nature of operations performed by the `removeAll` method and its comparable APIs, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of **NORMAL** to this method.
