To determine the access control level for the `cancelFaceDetect` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two code paths with similar structures, involving checks and operations related to face detection services and sensors. Both paths lead to a call to `cancelFaceDetect` on a service provider.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with face detection services, including getting sensor properties, checking for specific conditions, and eventually calling `cancelFaceDetect` on a provider.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `cancelEnrollment(Landroid/os/IBinder;J)V`: This API has an access control level of `NORMAL`. It involves canceling an enrollment process with a face service provider.
   - `cancelAuthentication(Landroid/os/IBinder;Ljava/lang/String;J)V`: Also has an access control level of `NORMAL`, and it's about canceling an authentication attempt with a face service.

Given the similarities in functionality (all are related to managing face detection or authentication processes) and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NORMAL`, we can infer that the `cancelFaceDetect` method likely requires a similar level of access control. This is because all these methods seem to interact with sensitive operations related to biometric authentication, which typically require careful handling but are not as restricted as system-level or signature-level permissions.

**Access Control Level Determination**: Considering the provided information and the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned `NORMAL` access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that the `cancelFaceDetect` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. This level suggests that while the operation is sensitive (as it involves biometric data), it's not as dangerous or system-critical as operations that would require `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or no protection at all (`NONE`).

**Final Access Control Level**:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This determination is based on the method's functionality, its similarity to other face service management APIs, and the standard practices for securing biometric data and operations in Android applications.
