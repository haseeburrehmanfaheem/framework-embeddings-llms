To assign an access control level to the `removeAccountExplicitly` method, we need to consider its functionality and how it interacts with sensitive data or system resources.

The provided code snippet for `removeAccountExplicitly` shows that it:

1. Checks the calling user's ID and permissions.
2. Interacts with the account database to remove an account.
3. Notifies broadcast receivers about the account removal.

Given these interactions, we can analyze the access control levels of similar APIs:

- `setPassword` and `invalidateAuthToken` both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. This is because they modify sensitive account data (passwords and auth tokens).

Considering the similarities in functionality and the need to protect account data, we can infer that `removeAccountExplicitly` should also have a similar access control level to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to account data.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the analysis of similar APIs, the assigned access control level for the `removeAccountExplicitly` method is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the need for system or signature-level permissions to ensure that only authorized components can remove accounts explicitly, thereby protecting user data and maintaining system security.
