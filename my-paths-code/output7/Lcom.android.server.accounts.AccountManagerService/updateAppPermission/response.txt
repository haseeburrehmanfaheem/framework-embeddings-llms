Since both paths are identical and do not contain any method invocations, field access or updates, object creation, or data flows that follow the positive rules for sinks, there are no potential sinks in this API.

However, considering the relaxed rule for small APIs to consider all instructions as part of a sink, we can identify the following:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "if (p4 == 0) {",
        "return;"
    ]
]
}
```

This set of instructions is not very sensitive since it only contains a conditional statement and a return statement. If there were more complex operations or data flows, they would be included in the sink. 

Note that this API does not seem to actually update any app permissions, despite its name. The method returns immediately if `p4` is 0 (which is equivalent to false), without performing any updates.
