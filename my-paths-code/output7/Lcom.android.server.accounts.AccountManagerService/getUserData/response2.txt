To determine the access control level for the `getUserData` API, we must analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The `getUserData` method involves several key operations:

1. **Validation of Input Parameters**: It checks if the account and key are not null.
2. **Checking Account Type**: It verifies if the account type is valid for the caller.
3. **Database Operations**: It performs queries on the database to retrieve user data, which includes accessing and possibly modifying the `userDataCache`.
4. **Security Checks**: It checks if the calling user is unlocked and performs operations based on the account's status.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- **addAccountExplicitlyWithVisibility**: This API also deals with accounts and has a high similarity score. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permissions to execute, likely due to its ability to add accounts explicitly and manage their visibility.

- **peekAuthToken**: Similar to `getUserData`, this API interacts with account-related data (auth tokens) and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that accessing or managing authentication tokens also requires system or signature-level permissions.

Given the similarities in functionality and the sensitive nature of the operations (accessing user data, which can include personal and sensitive information), it's reasonable to conclude that `getUserData` should have a similar access control level. The method's interaction with databases, caches, and its requirement for the caller to be an unlocked user or meet specific account management criteria further support this conclusion.

Therefore, considering the security implications and the comparisons made, the final access control level for the `getUserData` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination is based on the method's involvement in sensitive data retrieval and manipulation, which aligns with the need for system or signature-level permissions as observed in similar APIs.
