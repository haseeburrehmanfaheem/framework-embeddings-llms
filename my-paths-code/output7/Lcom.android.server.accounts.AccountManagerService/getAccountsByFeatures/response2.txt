After carefully reviewing the provided code snippets and similar APIs, I have determined that the `getAccountsByFeatures` method should be assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. 

Here's my reasoning:

1. The `getAccountsByFeatures` method does not seem to perform any sensitive operations that require elevated permissions or access control levels like `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS`.
2. The similar APIs provided, such as `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures` and `updateCredentials`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, these methods appear to involve more complex operations, such as binding to authenticators and updating credentials, which may require higher access control levels.
3. The sink code snippets provided do not indicate any sensitive data being accessed or modified, which further supports the assignment of a `NORMAL` access control level.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the `getAccountsByFeatures` method should be assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
