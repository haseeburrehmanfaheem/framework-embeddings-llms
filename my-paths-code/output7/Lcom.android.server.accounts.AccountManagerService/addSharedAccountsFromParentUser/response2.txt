Based on the provided information, I will analyze the code snippet and similar APIs to determine the access control level for the `addSharedAccountsFromParentUser` method.

The method interacts with sensitive data, such as accounts and user information, and performs operations like deleting and inserting shared accounts in the database. The sink code also indicates that it accesses and modifies the `shared_accounts` table in the database.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access sensitive data. The `addAccountExplicitlyWithVisibility` API, for example, requires a system or signature-level permission to add an account explicitly with visibility.

Considering the similarities between the `addSharedAccountsFromParentUser` method and the provided APIs, I conclude that it also requires a system or signature-level permission to access and modify sensitive data.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `addSharedAccountsFromParentUser` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
