To determine the access control level for the `getPreviousName` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The `getPassword` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that accessing sensitive account information like passwords requires a significant level of permission or signature verification.
   - The `clearPassword` API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating similar requirements for modifying account security settings.

2. **Code Snippets and Sinks:**
   - The code snippets provided for `getPreviousName` involve checking the calling user's identity, accessing database information related to accounts, and handling previous names of accounts.
   - The sink code points to interactions with account databases, cache management, and restoration of calling identities, which are sensitive operations.

3. **Access Control Levels:**
   - `NONE`: No specific access control is required. This seems too permissive for an operation that involves accessing potentially sensitive account information.
   - `NORMAL`: Basic level of protection but does not require system or signature-level permissions. Given the sensitivity of account data, this might still be insufficient.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Requires explicit user consent for operations that could pose a risk to the user's privacy or security. Accessing previous names might not directly fall into common dangerous operations like location access or camera usage but does involve sensitive account data.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Requires system-level permissions or signature verification, indicating a high level of trust and security requirement. This is consistent with the protection needed for operations involving account security information.

Given these considerations:

- The method involves accessing potentially sensitive account information (previous names), which suggests a need for more stringent access control than `NONE` or possibly even `NORMAL`.
- Similar APIs (`getPassword`, `clearPassword`) that deal with sensitive account information are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that operations related to account security and data should have high security requirements.
- The involvement of user identity checks, database interactions, and the handling of previous names implies a need for trust and security at least on par with system or signature-level permissions.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis of similar APIs, the nature of the `getPreviousName` method's operations, and the emphasis on security for account-related data, it is reasonable to assign an access control level that ensures a high degree of protection and trust.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This classification aligns with the need to protect sensitive account information and ensures consistency with other methods that handle similar types of data.
