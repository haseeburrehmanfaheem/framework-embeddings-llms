To determine the access control level for the `getAppExclusionList` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `getAppExclusionList` method involves several key operations:
1. It interacts with `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5)`, which are related to managing the calling identity of the current thread, typically used in interactions that require a secure or system-level context.
2. It accesses `LegacyVpnProfileStore.get(v7)`, suggesting it deals with VPN profile storage and retrieval, which can be sensitive as it involves network security settings.
3. The method constructs a list based on data retrieved from the VPN profile store, indicating its purpose is to provide information about excluded apps for a specific VPN profile.

Given these points, let's consider the similar APIs provided:
- `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission. This method also deals with VPN settings and checks if a package supports always-on VPN, which involves sensitive operations.
- `getLegacyVpnInfo` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves information about legacy VPN connections, which is sensitive as it pertains to network security configurations.

Both similar APIs deal with sensitive information related to VPN settings and network security. Given that the `getAppExclusionList` method also operates within this domain by retrieving and handling VPN exclusion lists (which could potentially reveal or affect network security settings), it's reasonable to infer that it should have a similar level of access control.

Considering the operations performed by `getAppExclusionList`, such as interacting with Binder identities and accessing sensitive VPN profile information, and comparing these with the operations and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, we can conclude that `getAppExclusionList` should also require a `SYS_OR_SIG` level of access control. This is because it handles sensitive network security settings and requires a secure context to operate, aligning with the requirements for system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getAppExclusionList` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
