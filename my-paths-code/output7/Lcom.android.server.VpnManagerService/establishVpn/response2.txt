To determine the access control level for the `establishVpn` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `establishVpn` method involves getting the calling UID and user ID, checking if lockdown is enabled, and then interacting with VPN configurations.
   - It checks for the "android:activate_vpn" app op permission before proceeding, which indicates a level of access control related to activating VPNs.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `isCallerCurrentAlwaysOnVpnLockdownApp()Z` has an access control level of NONE. This method seems to check if the caller is the current always-on VPN lockdown app without explicitly requiring dangerous permissions or specific app ops.
   - `addVpnAddress(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` also has an access control level of NONE. It adds a VPN address and involves getting the calling UID, checking for lockdown, and interacting with VPN configurations, similar to `establishVpn`.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - **NONE**: Typically used for methods that do not pose significant risks or do not require specific permissions.
   - **NORMAL**: Used for methods that require normal permissions which are granted at install time without user intervention.
   - **DANGEROUS**: Applies to methods needing dangerous permissions, which users must approve at runtime.
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: For system or signature-level permissions that are usually reserved for system apps or apps signed with the platform key.

Given these considerations:
- The `establishVpn` method does involve a check for "android:activate_vpn" app op permission, indicating it requires specific access control related to VPN activation.
- However, both similar APIs provided have an access control level of NONE, suggesting that the operations involved in managing or interacting with VPN configurations might not necessarily require elevated permissions like DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG.
- The method's interaction with system-level components (like getting the calling UID and checking lockdown status) and its requirement for a specific app op ("android:activate_vpn") imply a need for more than NONE access control but do not clearly align with the higher levels of NORMAL, DANGEROUS, or SYS_OR_SIG without explicit permission declarations.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level seems to be **NORMAL**, as it involves interactions that likely require permissions (like those related to VPN management) which are typically considered normal and granted upon installation. However, without explicit declaration of required permissions in the provided code snippet, this conclusion is based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of VPN-related operations.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This determination assumes that establishing a VPN connection requires specific, but not dangerous or system/signature-level permissions. The actual access control level could vary based on additional context or requirements not provided in the question.
