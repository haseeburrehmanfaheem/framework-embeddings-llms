To determine the access control level for the `getAlwaysOnVpnPackage` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with depth 1, but only one of them (the second path) seems to be relevant as it checks a condition (`this.mAlwaysOn == 0`) before potentially returning a value related to VPN configuration. However, the critical part that influences access control is how it interacts with `this.mVpns.get(p1)` and the subsequent operations.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code directly retrieves an object from `this.mVpns` based on `p1` and then calls `getAlwaysOnPackage()` on this object, suggesting that the method's purpose is to retrieve a package name related to always-on VPN settings for a specific user or context.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `isVpnLockdownEnabled(I)Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet involves retrieving an object from `this.mVpns` and then checking its lockdown status.
   - `getAppExclusionList(ILjava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/List;` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and it interacts with `this.mVpns` as well.

Given these points, we can observe that all relevant methods interact with `this.mVpns` in a manner that suggests they are dealing with sensitive VPN settings or configurations. The fact that similar APIs (`isVpnLockdownEnabled` and `getAppExclusionList`) have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` indicates that operations related to VPN configurations are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, considering the method's interaction with potentially sensitive VPN configuration data and the precedent set by similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getAlwaysOnVpnPackage` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
