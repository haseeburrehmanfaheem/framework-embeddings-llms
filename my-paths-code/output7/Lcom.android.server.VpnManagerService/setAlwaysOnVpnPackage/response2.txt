Based on the provided information, I will assign an access control level to the `setAlwaysOnVpnPackage` method.

The method interacts with sensitive data and functionality related to VPN settings, including lockdown VPN and package authorization. The similarity scores with other APIs, such as `getLegacyVpnInfo`, suggest that this method is also related to system-level or signature-protected functionality.

Considering the code snippets provided, I notice that:

1. The method checks for lockdown VPN enabled status (`v3 = p0.isLockdownVpnEnabled();`) and interacts with the `mVpns` map, which suggests access to sensitive VPN data.
2. The method updates settings related to always-on VPN packages, lockdown allowlists, and sends intents to the VPN manager app, indicating a level of system-level or signature-protected functionality.

Given these observations and the similarity scores with other APIs, I conclude that the `setAlwaysOnVpnPackage` method should have an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG**.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the method's interaction with sensitive system-level data and functionality, which requires a higher level of access control to prevent unauthorized or malicious modifications.
