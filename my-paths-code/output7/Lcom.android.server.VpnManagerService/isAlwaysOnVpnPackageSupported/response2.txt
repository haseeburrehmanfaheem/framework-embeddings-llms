To determine the access control level for the `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported` method, we should consider the similarities and differences between this method and the provided similar APIs, as well as the nature of its interactions.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The provided APIs (`getAppExclusionList(ILjava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/List;`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that they are either system-internal or require a specific signature to be accessed, indicating a level of restriction due to their potential impact on system security or functionality.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported` method interacts with VPN settings and package information, which can be sensitive.
   - It checks if the caller is the system (`this.mDeps.isCallerSystem()`), suggesting that not all callers are intended to have access to this functionality.
   - The method also queries intent services related to `android.net.VpnService`, which implies interaction with potentially security-sensitive components.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - **NONE**: This level suggests no restrictions, which seems inappropriate given the method's interactions with system and package information.
   - **NORMAL**: This is a basic level of access control but does not reflect the potential sensitivity of VPN package support checks.
   - **DANGEROUS**: While the method deals with potentially sensitive information (VPN support), it doesn't directly imply actions that could cause harm without additional context (like changing settings or accessing sensitive data without permission).
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: Given the similarities with other APIs that have this access control level and considering the method's need to verify the caller is the system, this seems like the most appropriate level. It reflects the requirement for either system-level access or a specific signature permission, aligning with the observed behavior in similar APIs.

Considering these points, the `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported` method appears to require a level of access control that restricts its use to system-internal calls or those with a specific signature, due to its interaction with sensitive VPN package support information and system caller verification.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination is based on the method's similarities with other restricted APIs, its interactions with potentially sensitive system and package information, and the observed need for system-level caller verification.
