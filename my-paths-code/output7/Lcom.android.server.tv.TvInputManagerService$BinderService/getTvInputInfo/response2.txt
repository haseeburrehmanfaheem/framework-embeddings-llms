To determine the access control level for the `getTvInputInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The code snippets for `getTvInputInfo` show interactions with `TvInputManagerService`, specifically accessing user states and input maps. This involves internal service management and data retrieval based on user IDs and input identifiers.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets highlight the access to locked resources (` TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock`), user states (`TvInputManagerService$UserState`), and input maps (`Map v14 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetinputMap(v8)`). This suggests that the method is dealing with sensitive data or resources that require synchronization or access control.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `captureFrame(Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/view/Surface;Landroid/media/tv/TvStreamConfig;I)Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves capturing frames, which might require system-level permissions or signature verification to ensure that only authorized applications can access and manipulate TV input streams.
   - `getTvInputState(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that getting the TV input state does not require specific permissions beyond what's normally required for app operation.

Given these points, we need to consider the nature of `getTvInputInfo`. The method seems to be retrieving information about a TV input based on a provided string identifier and user ID. This operation involves accessing internal service states and maps, which could potentially contain sensitive information or affect system behavior.

However, unlike `captureFrame`, which explicitly deals with media capture (a functionality that typically requires higher access control), `getTvInputInfo` seems focused on retrieving existing state or configuration information rather than modifying it or capturing sensitive content. This distinction suggests that while some level of access control might be necessary to protect user data and system integrity, it may not rise to the level required for operations like frame capture.

The similarity in code structure and the involvement of `TvInputManagerService` and its states/maps suggest that the method's primary risk lies in unauthorized access to user-specific TV input configurations or states. Given this context:

- **NONE** seems too permissive, as the method does interact with potentially sensitive system resources.
- **NORMAL** might be a reasonable choice if we consider that getting information about TV inputs could be a normal operation for many applications but still requires some level of access control to ensure it's done appropriately.
- **DANGEROUS** seems too restrictive unless there's an explicit risk of data leakage or system compromise by simply retrieving this information, which isn't clearly indicated from the provided snippets.
- **SYS_OR_SIG** implies a need for either system-level permissions or signature verification, typically reserved for operations that significantly impact system security or user privacy.

Given these considerations and without clear evidence that `getTvInputInfo` poses significant risks akin to those of media capture or requires system-level access, the most balanced approach seems to be assigning an access control level that recognizes the method's interaction with sensitive resources but does not unnecessarily elevate its permission requirements.

Therefore, considering the provided information and aiming for a cautious yet appropriate stance:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice reflects the need for some access control to protect system integrity and user data while acknowledging that retrieving TV input information is a plausible operation for applications interacting with TV services.
