To identify the sinks in the provided API `removeBroadcastInfo`, we need to analyze each path of execution and look for instructions that follow at least one of the positive rules.

### Path 1 Analysis
In Path 1, several methods are invoked with high naming similarity or use the input parameters (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`), such as:
- `TvInputManagerService.getOrCreateUserStateLocked(p4)` and `TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked(p2, p3, v10)`, which involve the API's parameters directly or indirectly.
- A new object creation is not directly observed here that would be considered a sink based on the provided rules. However, the method invocations with naming similarity to the API name (`removeBroadcastInfo`) and those processing input parameters are key.

The invocation of `v12.removeBroadcastInfo(p2)` also uses an input parameter (`p2`), showing dataflow from the API's parameters into this method call.

### Path 2 Analysis
In Path 2, we see:
- The method `this.this$0.getSessionStateLocked(p1, v1, v3)` is invoked with parameters related to the API inputs.
- `v9.removeBroadcastInfo(p2)` directly uses an input parameter (`p2`) and has a naming similarity with the API name.

These instructions contribute to potential sinks due to their method invocations that use or process the API's input parameters.

### Path 3 Analysis
In Path 3:
- Similar to the other paths, `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionStateLocked(this.this$0, p1, v1, v3)` and `v7.removeBroadcastInfo(p2)` involve the API's parameters or have naming similarity.

These method invocations process input parameters or show high relevance due to their names.

### Identifying Sinks
For each path, we identify a coherent set of instructions that together form potential sinks with clear dataflow links between them. We prioritize these based on sensitivity and direct involvement with the API's parameters and return values.

Given the analysis, here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int v5 = ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser(p2, p3, p4, 0, 0, p5, 0);",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v11 = TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked(p2, p3, v10);",
      "ITvInputSession v14 = TvInputManagerService$SessionState.-$$Nest$fgetsession(p2);",
      "v12.removeBroadcastInfo(p2);"
    ],
    [
      "int v4 = this.this$0.resolveCallingUserId(v2, v1, p3, \"removeBroadcastInfo\");",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v8 = this.this$0.getSessionStateLocked(p1, v1, v3);",
      "ITvInputSession v10 = this.this$0.getSessionLocked(v7);",
      "v9.removeBroadcastInfo(p2);"
    ],
    [
      "int v3 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(this.this$0, v2, v1, p3, \"removeBroadcastInfo\");",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState v6 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionStateLocked(this.this$0, p1, v1, v3);",
      "ITvInputSession v7 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetSessionLocked(this.this$0, v6);",
      "v7.removeBroadcastInfo(p2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

These sets of instructions represent the identified sinks for each path of the `removeBroadcastInfo` API. Each sink set includes method invocations that process input parameters or have naming similarity with the API name, adhering to the positive rules provided for identifying potential sinks.
