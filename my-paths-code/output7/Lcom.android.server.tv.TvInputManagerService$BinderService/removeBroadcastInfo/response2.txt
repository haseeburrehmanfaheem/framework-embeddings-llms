To assign an access control level to the `removeBroadcastInfo` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `removeBroadcastInfo` API has a similarity score of 0.9869822263717651 with the `requestBroadcastInfo` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippets of both APIs show similarities in handling user IDs and session states. Specifically, they both call `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` and `TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked`, which suggests that they are related to managing TV input sessions.

The `removeBroadcastInfo` API also has a similarity score of 0.9383163452148438 with the `setSurface` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although the similarity score is lower, the code snippets still show similarities in handling session states and calling methods on `ITvInputSession` objects.

Given these similarities, it is likely that the `removeBroadcastInfo` API requires a similar access control level to ensure that only authorized processes can remove broadcast information from TV input sessions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippets and the similarity scores with other APIs, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeBroadcastInfo` API.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
