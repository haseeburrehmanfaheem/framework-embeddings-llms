To determine the access control level for the `requestChannelBrowsable` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `requestChannelBrowsable` API sends a broadcast intent with the action "android.media.tv.action.CHANNEL_BROWSABLE_REQUESTED" and extras containing the channel ID and package name. This broadcast is sent using the `sendBroadcastAsUser` method, which requires the `android.permission.RECEIVE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_USAGE` permission.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `notifyResourceGranted(II)V`: This API also sends a broadcast intent, but with a different action ("android.intent.action.MEDIA_RESOURCE_GRANTED") and extras. It requires the `android.permission.RECEIVE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_USAGE` permission to receive the broadcast. The access control level for this API is `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any specific permissions or signatures to call.

2. `requestBroadcastInfo(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/media/tv/BroadcastInfoRequest;I)V`: This API handles a request for broadcast information and requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, which indicates that it can only be called by system or signature-protected applications.

Considering the similarities and differences between these APIs, we can conclude that the `requestChannelBrowsable` API does not require any specific permissions or signatures to call, as it is sending a broadcast intent that can be received by any application with the necessary permission. However, since it is related to TV input management and channel browsing, which are system-level features, it may still require some level of access control.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `requestChannelBrowsable` API, as it does not require any specific permissions or signatures to call but may still need to be protected from unauthorized access.

{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
