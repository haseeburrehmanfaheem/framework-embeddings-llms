To assign an access control level to the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs.

The given API has the following key aspects:
- It calls `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, which suggests some form of user handling or validation.
- It uses `TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2)`, indicating interaction with TV input states specific to a user.
- It accesses and potentially manipulates maps related to TV input states (`inputMap`) and services (`serviceStateMap`).
- The presence of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity` suggests that the method is interacting with binder calls, which could imply some level of permission or access control.

The similar APIs provided are:
1. `getTvInputState(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with an access control level of `NONE`.
2. `unregisterCallback(Landroid/media/tv/ITvInputManagerCallback;I)V` also with an access control level of `NONE`.

Both similar APIs interact with user states and TV input services, but they do not explicitly suggest a need for elevated permissions (like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`) based on the provided information. Their access control levels are set to `NONE`, indicating that they likely do not pose significant security risks or require special permissions beyond normal app operations.

Given this context, the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` API seems to follow similar patterns of interacting with TV input services and user states without explicit indications of requiring elevated permissions (e.g., accessing sensitive user data directly, performing system-level changes, etc.). The primary operations involve querying and potentially manipulating internal service states based on user inputs, which aligns more closely with `NONE` or possibly `NORMAL` access control levels.

However, since both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and there's no clear indication in the provided code snippet that `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` requires higher access rights (such as accessing sensitive information or performing system-critical operations), it is reasonable to conclude that this API should also be classified under a similar access control level.

Therefore, considering the nature of the API and its similarities with other APIs classified as `NONE`, the most appropriate access control level for `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This conclusion is based on the absence of clear indicators suggesting the need for elevated permissions or sensitive operations that would warrant a higher access control level.
