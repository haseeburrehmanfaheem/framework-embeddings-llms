To determine the access control level for the `startRecording` method, we should consider the similarities with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs, `stopRecording(Landroid/os/IBinder;I)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to recording (starting or stopping) are considered sensitive and require a certain level of system or signature protection to prevent unauthorized access.

Given the similarity in functionality between starting and stopping recordings, it's reasonable to infer that the `startRecording` method should have a similar access control level. The interactions with `ITvInputSession` and the management of sessions within the `TvInputManagerService` indicate that this method deals with sensitive operations that could impact system security or user privacy if not properly controlled.

Therefore, considering the similarity in purpose and functionality with the provided APIs, and the need to protect against unauthorized access to recording functionalities, the `startRecording` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
