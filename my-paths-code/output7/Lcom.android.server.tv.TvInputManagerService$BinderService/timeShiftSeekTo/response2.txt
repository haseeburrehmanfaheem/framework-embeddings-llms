To determine the access control level for the `timeShiftSeekTo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `timeShiftSeekTo` method involves several steps, including getting the calling user ID, handling incoming users, and interacting with a `TvInputManagerService`. The critical part of this method is its interaction with `ITvInputSession`, where it calls `timeShiftSeekTo(p2)`. This indicates that the method is performing an action related to TV input sessions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided shows interactions with `ITvInputSession` and handling of user IDs. This suggests that the security of this method is tied to how it manages access to TV input sessions and handles user identities.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `sendAppPrivateCommand` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also involves handling incoming users, similar to `timeShiftSeekTo`.
   - Another similar API, `sendCurrentChannelUri`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and involves user handling.

Given these points:

- Both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. This is likely due to their involvement in managing TV input sessions and handling sensitive user information.
- The `timeShiftSeekTo` method interacts with `ITvInputSession` and involves user ID handling, similar to the provided APIs.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `timeShiftSeekTo` method should have a similar access control level to ensure security and privacy in managing TV input sessions and handling user identities.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
