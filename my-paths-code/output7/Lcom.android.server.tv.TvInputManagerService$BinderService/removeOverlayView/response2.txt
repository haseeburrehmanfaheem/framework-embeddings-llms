To determine the access control level for the `removeOverlayView` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `removeOverlayView` method involves several steps including getting the calling user ID and process ID, handling incoming users, acquiring a lock (`TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock`), retrieving a session state and then a session locked object, and finally calling `removeOverlayView` on that session. This sequence suggests interaction with system-level components, particularly those related to TV input management.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink codes provided all lead to the invocation of `removeOverlayView` on an `ITvInputSession` object. This method seems to be part of managing or controlling TV input sessions, possibly removing overlays that are presented by these sessions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **relayoutOverlayView**: This API has a high similarity score with `removeOverlayView`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute. The method involves relaying out an overlay view, which is a related operation in the context of managing TV input sessions.
   - **unblockContent**: Although its similarity score is slightly lower than `relayoutOverlayView`, it still shares significant similarities with `removeOverlayView` and also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method is involved in unblocking content, which could be related to the management of TV input sessions.

Given these analyses:

- The operations (`removeOverlayView`, `relayoutOverlayView`, and `unblockContent`) all seem to interact with system-level components or require specific permissions to manage TV input sessions effectively.
- The similarity in access control levels between `relayoutOverlayView` and `unblockContent` (both being `SYS_OR_SIG`) suggests that operations related to managing TV input sessions, including overlay views, are considered sensitive and thus restricted to system or signature-level permissions.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's interaction with system components, its purpose in removing an overlay view which could impact the user experience or security of TV input sessions, and the access control levels of similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `removeOverlayView` should have a similar access control level to ensure consistency in managing these sensitive operations.

**Access Control Level**: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
This choice reflects the need for either system or signature-level permission to perform such operations, aligning with the principles observed in similar APIs and ensuring a consistent security posture for TV input session management.
