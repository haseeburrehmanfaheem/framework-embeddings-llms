To determine the access control level for the `removeBlockedRating` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeBlockedRating` method interacts with the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` and `PersistentDataStore` classes, which are also used in the similar APIs. The method removes a blocked rating from the user's state, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper access control.

Comparing the `removeBlockedRating` method with the similar APIs:

* The `isRatingBlocked` API has an access control level of `NONE`, but it only checks if a rating is blocked and does not modify any data. This API is read-only and does not pose a significant security risk.
* The `addBlockedRating` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permission to add a blocked rating. This API modifies the user's state and adds a new blocked rating, which is a sensitive operation.

Considering the similarity between the `removeBlockedRating` method and the `addBlockedRating` API, it is likely that the `removeBlockedRating` method also requires system or signature-level permission to remove a blocked rating. Removing a blocked rating can potentially allow access to previously restricted content, which is a security-sensitive operation.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `removeBlockedRating` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
