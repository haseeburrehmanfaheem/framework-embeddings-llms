To determine the access control level for the `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` method appears to handle TV input notifications by sending an intent based on specific conditions related to the TV program being watched or previewed.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **requestChannelBrowsable**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7679302096366882 with `sendTvInputNotifyIntent`. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it doesn't pose significant security risks. The code involves sending a broadcast intent after handling the user, which is somewhat similar to what `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` does.
   - **setAutoRevokeExempted**: With a similarity score of 0.7286423444747925, this API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting it requires higher privileges (either system or signature) due to its operations on package management and app ops.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - **NONE**: Typically assigned when the operation doesn't pose a significant security risk.
   - **NORMAL**: Requires a normal level of access control, usually for operations that can be performed by most apps without special permissions.
   - **DANGEROUS**: Assigned to operations that could potentially harm the user's privacy or cause financial loss if misused. These often require explicit user consent via permissions.
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: Indicates that the operation requires system-level privileges or a signature-level permission, usually for actions that are critical to system functionality or security.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` method involves sending broadcasts related to TV input notifications, which might not directly affect user privacy or cause financial loss but does interact with system-level components (like broadcasting intents).
   - Given its similarity to `requestChannelBrowsable`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, and considering that both methods involve intent broadcasting in a context that seems relatively contained within the TV input management framework, it suggests that `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` might not require high levels of access control.
   - However, the method does handle user IDs and broadcasts intents, which could imply some level of privilege. Yet, without explicit operations on sensitive data (like direct financial transactions or privacy-violating actions), the need for `SYS_OR_SIG` seems less pressing.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the provided similarities and the nature of the method's operations, it appears that `sendTvInputNotifyIntent` does not require the highest level of access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`) nor does it seem completely benign to warrant `NONE`. However, considering its functionality is more aligned with system-level services (like managing TV input notifications) and less directly impactful on user data or financial security compared to operations that would necessitate `DANGEROUS` permissions, the most fitting access control level seems to be `NORMAL`.

Given this analysis, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
