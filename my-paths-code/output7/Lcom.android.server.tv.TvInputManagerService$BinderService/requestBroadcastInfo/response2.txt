To determine the access control level for the `requestBroadcastInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `removeBroadcastInfo`: This API has a high similarity score with `requestBroadcastInfo` (0.9869822263717651) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `setSurface`: Although it has a slightly lower similarity score (0.9383202791213989), it also operates within a similar context and is assigned the same access control level, `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Code Semantics**:
   - The code for `requestBroadcastInfo` involves handling user IDs (`ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`), managing session states (`TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked`), and interacting with `ITvInputSession`. This pattern is consistent with the similar APIs, which also deal with session management and interaction with input sessions.
   - The presence of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` suggests that the method is concerned with identifying the caller's identity, a common practice in access control.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets provided show interactions with system services (`ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`), session state management (`TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked`), and direct calls to `ITvInputSession` methods (e.g., `requestBroadcastInfo`). These operations imply a level of privilege and trust, as they involve managing sessions and communicating with potentially sensitive components.

Given these observations:

- The high similarity scores and the consistent access control levels (`SYS_OR_SIG`) assigned to similar APIs suggest that `requestBroadcastInfo` likely requires a similar level of access control.
- The method's involvement in session management, user ID handling, and interaction with system services further supports the notion that it should be treated with a comparable level of security scrutiny.

Therefore, considering the similarity in functionality, code patterns, and the assigned access control levels of related APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `requestBroadcastInfo` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
