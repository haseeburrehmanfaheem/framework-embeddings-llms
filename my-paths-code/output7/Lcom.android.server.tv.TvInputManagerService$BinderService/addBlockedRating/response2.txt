To assign an access control level to the `addBlockedRating` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `addBlockedRating` method is used to add a blocked rating to the TV input manager service. It takes two parameters: `p1` (the rating to be blocked) and `p2` (the user ID). The method first resolves the calling user ID using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` and then retrieves the user state locked using `TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked`. If the user state is not null, it creates a new `TvContentRating` object from the provided rating string and adds it to the blocked ratings list.

The similar APIs provided are `isRatingBlocked` and `getBlockedRatings`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with the TV input manager service and user state, but they do not modify any data. The `isRatingBlocked` method checks if a rating is blocked, while the `getBlockedRatings` method retrieves the list of blocked ratings.

Comparing the code of `addBlockedRating` with the similar APIs, we can see that it modifies the blocked ratings list by adding a new rating. This modification requires some level of access control to ensure that only authorized users or processes can modify the blocked ratings.

However, since the similar APIs (`isRatingBlocked` and `getBlockedRatings`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that the TV input manager service does not enforce strict access control for rating-related operations. Therefore, we can assign a moderate access control level to the `addBlockedRating` method.

Based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `addBlockedRating` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires some level of authentication or authorization, but it is not as sensitive as methods that require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.
