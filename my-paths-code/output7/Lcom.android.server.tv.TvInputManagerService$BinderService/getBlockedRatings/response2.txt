To determine the access control level for the `getBlockedRatings` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getBlockedRatings` method appears to be part of a TV input manager service. It retrieves a list of blocked content ratings. The method involves handling user states, persistent data stores, and interacting with TV content rating objects.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets provided show how the method interacts with other components, such as resolving the calling user ID, getting or creating a user state, accessing a persistent data store to retrieve blocked ratings, and returning these ratings as a list of strings. This interaction suggests that the method is dealing with sensitive user data related to content preferences or restrictions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **unregisterCallback**: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. It's used for unregistering callbacks and doesn't directly deal with sensitive user data or system resources that would require higher access control levels.
   - **addBlockedRating**: With an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this API is involved in adding blocked ratings, which implies modifying user preferences or settings related to content restriction. This operation could potentially impact the system's behavior or user experience significantly.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `getBlockedRatings` deals with retrieving sensitive user data (blocked content ratings), it's reasonable to consider an access control level that ensures privacy and security.
   - The method does not seem to modify system settings or user data directly, as seen in `addBlockedRating`, but rather retrieves existing information.
   - Considering the similarity scores and the nature of operations:
     - If we lean towards the similarity with `unregisterCallback` (with an access control level of `NONE`), we might consider that retrieving blocked ratings doesn't necessarily require elevated permissions, as it's more about accessing existing user preferences rather than altering system states.
     - However, given the context of TV input management and content restriction, there's an implicit requirement to protect user data and ensure that such information is handled appropriately.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering the method's purpose, the similar APIs, and the need to balance access with protection of user data, the most appropriate access control level for `getBlockedRatings` seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects the method's involvement with user-specific data without implying a need for system-level modifications or signature-level permissions.
