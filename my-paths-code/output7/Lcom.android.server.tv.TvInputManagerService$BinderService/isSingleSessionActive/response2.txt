To determine the access control level for the `isSingleSessionActive` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `isSingleSessionActive` method has three paths, all of which involve checking the session state map of a `TvInputManagerService$UserState` object. The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity` to manage the calling identity, indicating that it is performing some kind of privileged operation.

The similar APIs provided are `getTvInputState` and `isParentalControlsEnabled`, both of which have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with `TvInputManagerService$UserState` objects and perform operations on their internal state.

However, the key difference between these APIs and `isSingleSessionActive` is that `isSingleSessionActive` does not appear to modify any sensitive data or perform any actions that would require elevated privileges. It simply checks the session state map and returns a boolean value indicating whether a single session is active.

Given this analysis, it seems that `isSingleSessionActive` does not require any special access control privileges beyond what is already provided by the Android framework. Therefore, its access control level should be `NONE`, similar to the other APIs provided.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
