To determine the access control level for the `hasPendingEscrowToken` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method checks if a token map contains a key based on the input parameter `p1` and then checks if a set related to this key is empty. This logic suggests it's checking for the presence of pending escrow tokens without modifying any data, which implies a read operation.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show interactions with token management, specifically getting pending tokens for a user or manipulating keys within token maps. These operations are about accessing or managing data related to token states.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API `removeWeakEscrowToken(JI)Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves removing a weak escrow token, which is a write operation that modifies the state of the token map.
   - The high similarity score between these APIs and `hasPendingEscrowToken` suggests they operate within similar contexts, likely related to managing or querying the state of tokens.

Given this analysis:

- **Read vs. Write Operations**: Unlike the similar API `removeWeakEscrowToken`, which performs a write operation (removing a token), `hasPendingEscrowToken` performs a read operation (checking if a pending escrow token exists). This distinction is crucial for determining access control levels, as write operations typically require higher access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications.

- **Access Control Levels**:
  - **NONE**: Typically used for methods that do not pose any risk and do not require special permissions.
  - **NORMAL**: For methods that are generally safe but may still need some form of permission or protection against misuse.
  - **DANGEROUS**: Methods that can cause harm if misused, such as those modifying sensitive data without proper authorization.
  - **SYS_OR_SIG**: For system-level operations or when a method requires a signature permission to execute, implying it needs elevated access rights.

Considering `hasPendingEscrowToken` is about checking the existence of tokens (a read operation) and given its similarity to APIs that manage token states but with a lower risk profile compared to write operations like removal:

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice reflects the method's nature as likely requiring some form of access control due to its interaction with sensitive data (token states) but not being as critical or dangerous as methods that modify this data, thus not necessarily requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` level protection. However, it still handles potentially sensitive information and thus should not be completely open (`NONE`). The actual choice might depend on the specific security policies of the system in question, but based on the provided information, `NORMAL` seems a reasonable assignment.
