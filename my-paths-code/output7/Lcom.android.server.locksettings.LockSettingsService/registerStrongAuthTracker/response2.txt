Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `registerStrongAuthTracker` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `registerStrongAuthTracker` method sends a message to a handler with an `IStrongAuthTracker` object as an argument. The sink code also shows that it calls another method `registerStrongAuthTracker` on an object `mStrongAuth`.

Looking at the similar APIs, we can see that they have a high similarity score (0.9896624088287354) and also send messages to a handler with an object as an argument. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality, it is likely that the `registerStrongAuthTracker` method requires a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign the following access control level to the `registerStrongAuthTracker` API:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is made considering the similarities with other APIs that have the same access control level and the fact that the method interacts with sensitive components (e.g., `IStrongAuthTracker`) that may require system or signature-level permissions.
