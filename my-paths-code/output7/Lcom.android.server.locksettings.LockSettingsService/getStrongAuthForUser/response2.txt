To determine the access control level for the `getStrongAuthForUser` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getStrongAuthForUser` method retrieves strong authentication requirements for a given user from a data structure (`this.mStrongAuthRequiredForUser`). It does not modify any system settings or perform actions that could be considered as altering security policies directly; it merely fetches existing information.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets show variations of how the `getStrongAuthForUser` method is called and its result used, but all essentially boil down to retrieving strong authentication requirements for a user. There's no indication of an action that would elevate privileges or directly impact system security in a dangerous way.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `registerStrongAuthTracker` API has a similarity score of 0.7653438448905945 and is assigned the access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method registers a strong auth tracker, which implies modifying or interacting with system-level security settings.
   - The `requireStrongAuth` API has a similarity score of 0.7552283406257629 and also carries an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It requires strong authentication for certain conditions, directly impacting security policies.

Given these similar APIs interact closely with system security settings and are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, we might initially consider `getStrongAuthForUser` to be in a similar vein due to its related functionality. However, it's crucial to differentiate based on the actual action performed:

- `registerStrongAuthTracker` and `requireStrongAuth` both imply setting or altering security settings directly.
- `getStrongAuthForUser`, on the other hand, is purely informational; it retrieves existing settings without modifying them.

Considering this distinction, while `getStrongAuthForUser` deals with sensitive information regarding user authentication, its read-only nature does not pose a direct risk to system integrity or security in the way that setting or modifying these settings would. Therefore, it doesn't fit neatly into the `SYS_OR_SIG` category based on the actions described.

However, given the context of accessing potentially sensitive user information and considering the proximity to system security functions, assigning `NONE` might underestimate its sensitivity. Between `NORMAL` and `DANGEROUS`, since retrieving strong auth requirements for a user doesn't directly enable or disable dangerous functionalities but does handle sensitive data, it leans more towards requiring some level of access control without being overtly dangerous.

Given the options provided:
- `NONE`: Too permissive given its interaction with security settings.
- `NORMAL`: Reflects a balanced approach considering it handles sensitive information but doesn't modify system settings.
- `DANGEROUS`: Overly restrictive as it's primarily a retrieval method, not a setting or modification of security policies.
- `SYS_OR_SIG`: Typically reserved for methods that directly impact system security policies in a more significant way.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This assignment acknowledges the method's interaction with sensitive information without overestimating its potential to cause harm or require system/signature-level permissions.
