To determine the access control level for the `requireStrongAuth` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs, `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` and `registerStrongAuthTracker`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

These APIs are similar in that they all involve sending messages via a handler (`this.mHandler.obtainMessage()` followed by `sendToTarget()`), which suggests they are interacting with system-level components or performing operations that require significant privileges.

Given the similarity score and the nature of the operations performed, it's reasonable to infer that the `requireStrongAuth` method is also dealing with system-level functionality or security-related features. The fact that it checks for a condition (`p2 == -1`) before proceeding with sending a message indicates specific handling based on input parameters, which might be related to security or authentication mechanisms.

Therefore, considering the similarity in code patterns and the context of system or security-related operations, the access control level for `requireStrongAuth` should be aligned with those of its similar APIs.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination is based on the method's operational similarity to other system or signature-protected APIs and the implication that it interacts with sensitive components or security features, thus requiring a higher level of access control.
