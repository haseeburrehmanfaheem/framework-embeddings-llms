To assign an access control level to the `getRecoverySecretTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getRecoverySecretTypes` method appears to interact with a database (`SQLiteDatabase`) to retrieve recovery secret types based on user ID and UID. It performs queries on the "recovery_service_metadata" table and handles the results, including parsing and returning an array of integers.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The method involves database operations (querying for specific data).
   - It retrieves and processes sensitive information ("secret_types").
   - The interaction with `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()` suggests it's aware of the caller's identity, which is crucial for access control decisions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`setRecoverySecretTypes([I)V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that setting recovery secret types requires either system or signature-level permission, suggesting that these operations are considered sensitive and should be restricted.
   - The high similarity score between these APIs and `getRecoverySecretTypes` implies that they share similar functionality or interact with the same data in a related manner. Given that setting secret types is considered sensitive enough to warrant `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it's reasonable to infer that getting (reading) this information might also require some level of restriction.

4. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Considering the method retrieves potentially sensitive information and its similarity to APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, assigning `NONE` or `NORMAL` might be too permissive.
   - The operation does not seem to modify system state in a dangerous way but rather reads from it. Thus, `DANGEROUS` might not be the most fitting choice unless the information retrieved poses a significant risk if accessed improperly.
   - Given the context and similarities with other APIs, `SYS_OR_SIG` seems like an appropriate access control level because it aligns with the protection afforded to similar operations (setting secret types) and acknowledges the potential sensitivity of the data being accessed.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality, its interaction with sensitive data, and the access control levels of similar APIs, the most suitable access control level for `getRecoverySecretTypes` is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
