Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `initRecoveryServiceWithSigFile` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `initRecoveryServiceWithSigFile` method appears to be related to initializing a recovery service with a signature file. It performs various checks and operations, including verifying the signature of the recovery service certificate file and updating the active root of trust.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `setRecoveryStatus(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.8353334665298462 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
2. `setRecoverySecretTypes([I)V` with a similarity score of 0.8189637660980225 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `initRecoveryServiceWithSigFile` method, it is likely that this method also requires system or signature-level permissions to execute. Therefore, I would assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to the `initRecoveryServiceWithSigFile` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
