Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getLights` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `getLights` method appears to be retrieving a list of lights from a `SparseArray` called `mLightsById`. The method iterates over the array, checks the type of each light, and adds it to an `ArrayList` if certain conditions are met. The method returns this list of lights.

The similar APIs provided, `getLightState(I)Landroid/hardware/lights/LightState;`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with lights, but they retrieve the state of a specific light instead of a list of lights.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all interact with sensitive lighting information, it is likely that the `getLights` method should have a similar access control level. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that the API is only accessible to system or signature applications, which is reasonable given the potential sensitivity of lighting information.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the `getLights` method and its similar APIs, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getLights` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
