Based on the provided information, I will analyze the code and similar APIs to determine the access control level for the `queryStatsForUser` method.

The `queryStatsForUser` method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `getInstalledApplicationsAsUser`: This method is used to retrieve a list of installed applications for a given user.
2. `getUserSize`: This method is used to retrieve the size of a user's data.
3. `PackageStats`: This class is used to store package statistics, including code size, data size, cache size, and external storage sizes.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getCacheBytes`: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and interacts with similar sinks, such as `getInstalledApplicationsAsUser` and `getUserSize`.
2. `queryStatsForUid`: This method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and interacts with similar sinks, including `getApplicationInfoAsUser` and `getAppSize`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that the `queryStatsForUser` method may also require a similar level of access control.

After analyzing the code and similar APIs, I conclude that the `queryStatsForUser` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method interacts with sensitive data, such as package statistics and user sizes, which requires a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
