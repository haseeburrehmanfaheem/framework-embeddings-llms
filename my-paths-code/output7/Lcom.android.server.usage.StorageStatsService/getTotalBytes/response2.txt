To assign an access control level to the `getTotalBytes` method, we need to analyze its functionality, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The `getTotalBytes` method calculates the total bytes of storage based on the provided UUID. If the UUID does not match a specific internal storage identifier, it attempts to find a volume by the given UUID. If no such volume is found (or if it's null), it returns the size of the disk after rounding it using `FileUtils.roundStorageSize(DiskInfo.size)`.

The sink code snippet provided directly relates to this calculation:
```java
long v2 = FileUtils.roundStorageSize(DiskInfo.size);
return v2;
```
This operation does not modify any system settings, access sensitive user data directly (like contacts, location, etc.), or perform actions that would typically be classified as dangerous (e.g., sending SMS, making calls, accessing external storage without permission). It appears to be an informational or query-type method intended to provide the size of storage.

Comparing this with the similar API `getDisks()[Landroid/os/storage/DiskInfo;`, which has a similarity score of 0.7881491184234619 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`, we see that both methods are involved in querying or retrieving information related to storage without modifying system settings or accessing sensitive data.

Given this analysis, the `getTotalBytes` method should also be classified as having a low-risk profile since it's primarily used for informational purposes (retrieving storage size) and does not perform any actions that could be considered dangerous or privacy-infringing.

Therefore, the access control level for the `getTotalBytes` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This classification reflects its nature as an information retrieval method without potential for harm or data exposure.
