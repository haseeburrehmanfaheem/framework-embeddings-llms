Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `queryExternalStatsForUser` method interacts with the `mInstalld` object, which is likely a privileged interface, and retrieves external storage statistics for a given user. The method also checks the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and performs various operations based on the result.

The similar APIs, `queryStatsForPackage` and `queryStatsForUser`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs also interact with privileged interfaces, such as `mInstalld`, and perform operations that require elevated permissions.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method, it is likely that the latter also requires a similar level of access control. Therefore, based on the provided information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities between the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method and the provided similar APIs, as well as the method's interactions with privileged interfaces and its potential to perform operations that require elevated permissions.
