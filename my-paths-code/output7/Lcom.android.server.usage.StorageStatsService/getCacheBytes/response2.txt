To determine the access control level for the `getCacheBytes` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `getCacheBytes` method involves several operations:

1. It retrieves a list of users using `this.mUser.getUsers()`.
2. It iterates over the installed applications for a given user using `this.mPackage.getInstalledApplicationsAsUser(8192, p2)`.
3. It checks if an application's UID is in a specific array using `ArrayUtils.contains(, v17)`.
4. It retrieves package statistics using `this.mInstalld.getUserSize(p1, p2, v23, v12)`.

The similar APIs provided also involve retrieving installed applications and package statistics. They have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive information.

Given the similarities between the `getCacheBytes` method and the provided APIs, it's likely that `getCacheBytes` also requires system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive user and package information. Therefore, the access control level for the `getCacheBytes` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
