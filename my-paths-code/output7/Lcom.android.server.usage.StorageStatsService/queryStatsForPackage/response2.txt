Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `queryStatsForPackage` method.

The method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them involve getting the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and then checking if the package is a system app or an updated system app. The method also interacts with the `mInstalld` object to get the app size and update the `PackageStats` object.

The sink code provided shows that the method updates the `PackageStats` object and returns a `StorageStats` object.

Comparing this method with the similar APIs provided, we can see that:

* The `queryStatsForUid` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and also interacts with the `mInstalld` object to get the app size and update the `PackageStats` object.
* The `requestQuietModeEnabled` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, but it does not interact with the `mInstalld` object or update the `PackageStats` object.

However, both similar APIs have a high similarity score with the `queryStatsForPackage` method, indicating that they share some common functionality and structure.

Given this information, we can conclude that the `queryStatsForPackage` method is likely to require a system or signature-level permission to access the app size and update the `PackageStats` object. Therefore, the access control level for this method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
