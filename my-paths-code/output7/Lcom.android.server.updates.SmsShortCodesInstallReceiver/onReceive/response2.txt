To assign an access control level to the `onReceive` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the operations performed by these APIs do not pose significant risks or require special permissions.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet for the `onReceive` method and its similar APIs involve creating an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and calling its `start()` method. There's no apparent interaction with sensitive data, hardware components, or actions that could potentially harm the system or violate user privacy directly within these snippets.

3. **Sink Code**: The sink code provided also involves the creation and execution of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, similar to the API's code snippet. This pattern does not inherently suggest a need for elevated permissions or special access controls based on the information given.

Given this analysis, since both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and there's no explicit indication that the `onReceive` method interacts with sensitive resources or performs dangerous operations beyond what's shown in the similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
