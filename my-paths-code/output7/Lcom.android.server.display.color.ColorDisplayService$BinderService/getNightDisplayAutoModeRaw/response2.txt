To determine the access control level for the `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` method retrieves the night display auto mode setting from the secure settings for a specific user. It uses `Settings$Secure.getIntForUser` to fetch this setting, which involves interacting with system settings that are typically considered sensitive or protected by access controls.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code points involve retrieving an integer value related to the night display auto mode, either directly from secure settings or through internal methods (`getNightDisplayAutoModeRawInternal`). These operations suggest interaction with potentially sensitive system configuration data.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs have a high similarity score (> 0.96) and are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the functionality related to getting night display auto mode settings is generally considered to require either system or signature-level permission, possibly due to its interaction with secure settings.
   - The internal implementation details (e.g., directly accessing secure settings vs. calling another internal method) do not seem to alter the access control level in these similar cases.

Given this analysis:
- The `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` method interacts with sensitive system settings.
- Similar APIs, despite minor differences in implementation, are categorized under `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating a need for either system or signature-level permissions due to their interaction with secure or protected data/settings.

Therefore, considering the interactions with system settings and the precedent set by similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
