To assign an access control level to the `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method retrieves a custom end time for night display from the secure settings. Here are key points about its operation:

1. **Access to Secure Settings**: It accesses secure settings using `Settings$Secure.getIntForUser`, which suggests interaction with sensitive user data.
2. **No Direct Modification of System State**: Unlike the similar APIs provided (e.g., `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`), this method does not modify any system state directly; it only reads a setting.
3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar APIs (`setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permission because they can alter system settings.
   - The method in question, however, is a getter and does not modify any system settings. It only reads a value from secure settings.

Considering these points:

- **NONE** seems inappropriate because the method does access user-specific settings which might be considered sensitive.
- **NORMAL** could be a fit since it's a getter method that doesn't directly alter system state, but accessing secure settings might require more than normal permissions depending on the context and Android version.
- **DANGEROUS** is typically used for operations that can cause harm to the user or the system if not properly authorized (e.g., accessing location, contacts). This doesn't seem to fit perfectly because getting a custom end time isn't inherently dangerous.
- **SYS_OR_SIG** suggests a need for either system-level or signature-level permissions. Given that this method reads from secure settings but does not modify them, it might not require such high-level access control.

Given the similarities with other APIs and considering the nature of the operation (reading from secure settings without modification), but also acknowledging the potential sensitivity of accessing user-specific data:

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
