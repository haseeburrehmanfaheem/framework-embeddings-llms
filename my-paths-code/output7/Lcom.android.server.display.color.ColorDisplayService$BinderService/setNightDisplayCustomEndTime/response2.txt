To assign an access control level to the `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method, we need to analyze its functionality, the sinks it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Functionality Analysis**: The `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method sets a custom end time for night display. It takes a `Time` object as input, converts it into seconds of the day, and then stores this value in the secure settings using `Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`. This operation involves modifying system settings related to display, which could potentially impact user experience but does not directly access sensitive information or perform critical operations that require high-level permissions.

2. **Sink Analysis**: The sinks mentioned involve getting the local time from the input `Time` object and storing an integer value in secure settings. These operations are specific to modifying a system setting and do not indicate direct access to sensitive user data, location, contacts, etc., or dangerous operations like sending SMS, making calls, etc.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**: The provided similar APIs (`getNightDisplayCustomEndTime`) have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods are involved in retrieving the custom end time for night display, which is a read operation rather than a write operation like `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`. However, both operations deal with system settings related to display customization. The fact that reading this setting does not require any special permission suggests that writing to it might also not be considered dangerous or requiring special access control.

Given these considerations:

- **NONE** seems inappropriate because the method does modify system settings, which could have implications on user experience and device functionality.
- **NORMAL** appears to be a reasonable choice since the operation involves modifying system settings but doesn't seem to pose significant risks like accessing sensitive user data or performing dangerous actions.
- **DANGEROUS** seems too restrictive given that setting a night display custom end time does not directly relate to sensitive operations or data access typically classified as dangerous (e.g., sending SMS, accessing location).
- **SYS_OR_SIG** might be considered if the operation significantly impacts system functionality or security, but based on the provided information, it doesn't seem to require signature or system-level permissions.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality and comparing it with similar APIs that have `NONE` access control for read operations, a balanced approach would suggest assigning an access control level of **NORMAL** to `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`, as it modifies system settings which is somewhat more significant than just reading them but does not rise to the level of being dangerous or requiring system/signature permissions.
