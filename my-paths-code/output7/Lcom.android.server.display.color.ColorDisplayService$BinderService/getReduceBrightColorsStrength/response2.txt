To determine the access control level for the `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` method has two possible paths to retrieve the strength value:

1. Directly from `this.mStrength`.
2. Through `ReduceBrightColorsTintController` using `v2.getStrength()`.

Both paths are used to return an integer value representing the reduce bright colors strength.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- `getReduceBrightColorsOffsetFactor()`: This method also accesses a property (`getOffsetFactor()`) of `ReduceBrightColorsTintController`, similar to one of the paths in `getReduceBrightColorsStrength`. Its access control level is `NONE`.
- `getNightDisplayColorTemperature()`: This method accesses a property (`getColorTemperature()`) of another controller (`NightDisplayTintController`), which is somewhat analogous to accessing properties through controllers as seen in `getReduceBrightColorsStrength`. Its access control level is also `NONE`.

Given the similarities and the fact that these methods are all about retrieving display-related settings without any indication of performing sensitive operations (like those involving user data, location, camera, etc., which would typically require higher access control levels), it's reasonable to conclude that `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` should have a similar access control level as its counterparts.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
