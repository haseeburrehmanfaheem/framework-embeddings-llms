To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method modifies a secure setting (`"night_display_custom_start_time"`), which suggests that it may require some form of access control to prevent unauthorized changes.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`, indicating that the method is using binder calls, possibly suggesting an interaction with system services or other components that might be protected by access controls.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()`) have an access control level of `NONE`. However, these methods are for retrieving information, not setting it, which typically requires less stringent access control compared to modifying settings.
   - Despite the similarity in names and functionalities (related to night display custom start time), the difference between getting and setting values can justify different access control levels due to the potential impact on system settings.

Given these considerations:

- The method `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` modifies a system setting, which could potentially affect how the device operates (in this case, related to display settings).
- The use of binder calls (`Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`) might indicate interaction with system-level services.
- The fact that similar "get" methods have an access control level of `NONE` does not directly imply the same for a "set" method, as setting typically requires more stringent controls than getting.

However, based on the provided similar APIs and their assigned access control levels (`NONE`), it might suggest that the system considers these operations (related to night display custom start time) as not critical enough to warrant higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL`. This interpretation leans towards treating the setting of night display custom start times with a level of openness similar to retrieving such information, possibly due to the specific nature of this setting and its impact on system functionality.

Therefore, considering the context provided:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice acknowledges that while there might be some need for access control (given it's a setting operation), the similarity with `NONE` leveled APIs and the nature of the setting itself suggests a moderate approach. However, without explicit guidance from similar methods that also modify settings or more detailed context about the system's security model, this decision leans on the side of caution while recognizing the operational differences between "get" and "set" operations. 

Given the information provided and typical Android access control practices, `NORMAL` seems a reasonable choice for an operation that modifies device settings but is not explicitly marked as dangerous or system/service-internal by similar APIs or context clues.
