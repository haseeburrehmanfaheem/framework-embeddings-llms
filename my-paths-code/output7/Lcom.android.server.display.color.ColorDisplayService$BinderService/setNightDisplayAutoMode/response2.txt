To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayAutoMode` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method interacts with system settings through `Settings$Secure.putStringForUser` and `Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`, which are related to secure settings that could potentially affect system behavior or user data privacy.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sinks involve getting and setting night display auto mode, including writing to secure settings. This indicates potential system-level modifications that could impact the device's functionality and security.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `getNightDisplayAutoMode()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It suggests that operations related to reading or modifying night display modes are considered sensitive, requiring either system or signature-level permissions.
   - `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw()` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating less sensitivity. However, the method name includes "Raw," which might imply a different context or usage scenario than `setNightDisplayAutoMode`.

Given these considerations:

- The method modifies secure settings (`Settings$Secure.putIntForUser` and `putStringForUser`), which typically requires careful access control to prevent unauthorized changes that could compromise system security or user data.
- The interaction with `ColorDisplayService.getNightDisplayAutoModeInternal()` and setting auto mode suggests a level of system integration that might require specific permissions.

Considering the above points, especially the sensitivity of modifying secure settings and the similarity in functionality with other APIs that have higher access control levels (like `SYS_OR_SIG` for `getNightDisplayAutoMode()`), it seems reasonable to conclude that `setNightDisplayAutoMode` should also be assigned a significant level of access control.

However, since `setNightDisplayAutoMode` involves setting system settings which might not necessarily require the highest level of system or signature permissions but still impacts device functionality, we can deduce its access control level based on the provided similar APIs and their levels.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
