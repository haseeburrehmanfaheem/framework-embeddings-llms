To determine the access control level for the `getGameMode` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs. 

The `getGameMode` method involves several key operations:
1. It calls `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, which suggests interaction with user-specific data.
2. It retrieves an `ApplicationInfo` object using `this.mPackageManager.getApplicationInfoAsUser`, indicating a need to access application information based on the user ID.
3. The method checks if certain settings or game modes are contained within maps (`this.mSettings.containsKey` and `this.mGameModes.containsKey`), suggesting it handles specific configurations or states for applications or games.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:
- Both provided similar APIs (`isAngleEnabled`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods, which also interact with user-specific data and application configurations (though differently in terms of specifics like checking for angle enablement), require a system or signature-level permission to execute. The similarity in code structure, especially the use of `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` and accessing application information via `PackageManager`, supports this comparison.

Given these points:
- The `getGameMode` method's operations are closely related to those of the similar APIs (`isAngleEnabled`), which have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The method's interaction with system-level data (user IDs, application information) and its checks on specific settings or configurations imply a need for restricted access.

Therefore, considering the similarities in functionality and the implications of these operations on system and user data, it is reasonable to assign the `getGameMode` method an access control level similar to that of the provided APIs.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
