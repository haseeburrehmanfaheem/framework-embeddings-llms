Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `getAvailableGameModes` method.

The `getAvailableGameModes` method interacts with the `mOverrideConfigs` and `mConfigs` objects, which are also accessed by the similar APIs `getGameModeInfo` and `getGameMode`. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive game mode information.

The `getAvailableGameModes` method also returns an array of integers representing available game modes, which is similar to the return type of the `getGameModeInfo` API. Additionally, the sink code of `getAvailableGameModes` includes calls to `getAvailableGameModesUnchecked`, which suggests that it may be accessing sensitive information.

Given these similarities and the access control levels of the related APIs, it is likely that the `getAvailableGameModes` method also requires system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive game mode information. Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment is based on the similarity in functionality and return types with other APIs that have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, as well as the potential access to sensitive game mode information.
