To assign an access control level to the `getGameModeInfo` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels. 

The `getGameModeInfo` method interacts with several sinks, including:
1. `getApplicationInfoAsUser`: This suggests interaction with application information, which could be sensitive.
2. `containsKey` and `get` methods of `mSettings` and `mOverrideConfigs`: These imply accessing and manipulating settings or configurations, which might require certain permissions.
3. `GameManagerService$GamePackageConfiguration.getAvailableGameModesBitfield()`: This method call indicates involvement with game modes and their configurations.

The similar APIs provided are:
- `getGameMode(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API seems to retrieve a game mode from settings, suggesting it deals with sensitive or system-level information.
- `notifyGraphicsEnvironmentSetup(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves setting up the graphics environment and checking game modes from settings.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it implies they are dealing with system or signature-level permissions, which are typically required for operations that involve system-level configurations or sensitive information.

The `getGameModeInfo` method, by interacting with application info, settings, and game mode configurations, seems to be operating within a similar domain. It does not appear to perform any operations that would categorize it as `DANGEROUS` (which typically involves direct access to sensitive user data or capabilities to make significant changes to the system or user data without explicit user consent), nor does it seem to fit perfectly into `NONE` or `NORMAL`, given its interaction with potentially sensitive settings and configurations.

Therefore, considering the interactions of `getGameModeInfo` with system-level configurations and settings, and comparing it with similar APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that `getGameModeInfo` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
