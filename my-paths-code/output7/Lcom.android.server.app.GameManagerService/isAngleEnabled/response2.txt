To determine the access control level for the `isAngleEnabled` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves checking the calling user's ID and package name, handling incoming users, getting application info, and accessing game mode configurations.
2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve similar operations like handling incoming users, getting application info, and accessing game mode configurations.
3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getGameMode(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with a similarity score of 0.9738648533821106 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
   - Another `getGameMode(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with a similarity score of 0.9596787691116333, also having an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Given these points:

- The method `isAngleEnabled` deals with sensitive operations such as handling user IDs, accessing application information, and game mode configurations, which are similar to the operations performed by the `getGameMode` APIs.
- Both provided `getGameMode` APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to access their functionality. This suggests that operations related to game modes and user/application information handling are considered sensitive.
- The similarity in functionality and the presence of similar checks (e.g., `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`, accessing application info) between `isAngleEnabled` and the `getGameMode` APIs imply that `isAngleEnabled` should have a comparable level of access control.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that the `isAngleEnabled` method should also be assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, as it handles sensitive information related to game modes and user/application data, similar to the `getGameMode` APIs.
