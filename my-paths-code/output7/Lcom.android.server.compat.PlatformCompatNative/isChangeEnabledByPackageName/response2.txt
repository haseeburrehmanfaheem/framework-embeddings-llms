To determine the access control level for the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with depth 2, all of which involve interactions with `PackageManagerInternal` class and application info. The critical parts include getting an application's information based on its package name and a user ID, checking if a change is enabled by package name, or directly reporting changes.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show interactions with `PackageManagerInternal`, retrieval of application information, and checks for whether certain changes are enabled. These operations suggest access to potentially sensitive information about applications and their configurations.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **isChangeEnabledByPackageName(JLjava/lang/String;I)Z**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9373387098312378) with the method in question and is assigned an `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Its code involves getting application info and checking if a change will be enabled, which aligns closely with the operations performed by `isChangeEnabledByPackageName`.
   - **isChangeEnabledByUid(JI)Z**: Although this API has a slightly lower similarity score (0.9022952318191528), it's also assigned an `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Its operation involves checking if a change is enabled by UID, which shares the theme of managing or querying application-level changes based on identifiers.

Given these observations:
- The method interacts with sensitive application information and change management logic.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute securely.

Therefore, considering the semantics of the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method and its similarity to other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also be assigned a similar level of access control to ensure secure execution and prevent unauthorized access to application information or change management capabilities.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
