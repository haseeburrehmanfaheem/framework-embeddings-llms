Based on the provided information, I will assign an access control level to the `notifyDeviceAppeared` API.

The `notifyDeviceAppeared` API has a similarity score of 0.9104941487312317 with the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Additionally, it has a similarity score of 0.9099335670471191 with the `disassociate` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The sink code for `notifyDeviceAppeared` involves checking the caller's permissions using `PermissionsUtils.checkCallerCanManageAssociationsForPackage`, which is similar to the permission checks performed in the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` and `disassociate` APIs.

Given these similarities, I conclude that the `notifyDeviceAppeared` API should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is likely to require similar permissions and access controls as the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` and `disassociate` APIs.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
