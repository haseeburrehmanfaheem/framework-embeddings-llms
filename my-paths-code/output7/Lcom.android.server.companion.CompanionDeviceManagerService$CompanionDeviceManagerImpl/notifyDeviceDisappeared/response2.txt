To determine the access control level for the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method, we should analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs (`disassociate` and `notifyDeviceAppeared`) along with their assigned access control levels.

1. **Analysis of Code Paths**:
   - The method checks if a device association exists for the given ID (`Integer v3 = Integer.valueOf(p1); Object v4 = this.mIdMap.get(v3);`).
   - It then retrieves the user ID and package name from the association info (`int v7 = v2.getUserId(); String v8 = v2.getPackageName();`) and checks if the caller can manage associations for that package using `PermissionsUtils.checkCallerCanManageAssociationsForPackage(v5, v7, v8)`.
   - If the check passes, it proceeds to handle the device disappearance logic, which includes removing the device from a list of reported self-managed devices (`boolean v15 = this.mReportedSelfManagedDevices.remove(v14);`) and checking if the device is still present using `CompanionDevicePresenceMonitor.isDevicePresent(p1)`.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **disassociate(I)V**: This API has a similarity score of 0.9592111706733704 with `notifyDeviceDisappeared` and is assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. The provided code snippet for `disassociate` involves similar checks for managing associations based on the user ID and package name, suggesting that both APIs deal with sensitive operations related to device associations.
   - **notifyDeviceAppeared(I)V**: With a similarity score of 0.9104941487312317, this API also operates within the context of device association management and is assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code involves sanitizing the association info based on caller checks and updating the association details.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs (`disassociate` and `notifyDeviceAppeared`) are assigned the SYS_OR_SIG access control level, and considering the code paths of `notifyDeviceDisappeared` which involve sensitive operations like managing device associations and checking presence based on package and user ID, it's reasonable to conclude that `notifyDeviceDisappeared` should also be assigned a similar access control level.
   - The SYS_OR_SIG access control level indicates that the API can be accessed by system or signature applications, reflecting its need for elevated permissions due to its involvement in managing device associations and presence.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis of code paths and comparison with similar APIs, the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method should be assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This reflects the API's requirement for system or signature-level permissions to perform operations related to device association management securely.
