Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `canPairWithoutPrompt` method.

The method has three paths with depth 2, and it interacts with the `AssociationStoreImpl` class, which is also used in the similar APIs. The sink code snippets show that the method accesses the `mAddressMap` and `mIdMap` fields of the `AssociationStoreImpl` instance, and uses the `MacAddress.fromString` method to convert an integer to a MAC address.

The similar APIs, `isDeviceAssociatedForWifiConnection` and `getAssociations`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the `AssociationStoreImpl` class and use similar lambda expressions to filter associations. The similarity scores between the `canPairWithoutPrompt` method and these APIs are high (0.8904051780700684 and 0.8702802658081055, respectively), indicating that they share similar functionality.

Considering the similarities in code structure, functionality, and access patterns, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to the `canPairWithoutPrompt` method as its similar APIs.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities between the `canPairWithoutPrompt` method and its similar APIs, which have an established access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The method's interactions with sensitive data, such as MAC addresses and association maps, also support this assignment.
