To determine the access control level for the `clearOverrideForTest` API, we need to analyze its code paths, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `clearOverrideForTest` method involves removing an override for a specific change identified by `p1` (a long value) and a package or version specified by `p2` (a String). This removal is done through the `CompatConfig.removeOverrideUnsafe` method.
   - It also handles file operations related to overrides, such as renaming, creating new files, and deleting old ones. These operations seem to be part of managing override configurations.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets involve removing overrides using `removeOverride` or `removeOverrideUnsafe` methods, which are directly related to the functionality of `clearOverrideForTest`.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`clearOverride(JLjava/lang/String;)Z` and `clearOverridesForTest(Ljava/lang/String;)V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to clearing or removing overrides typically require system or signature-level permissions, likely due to the sensitive nature of these configurations.

Given these points:

- The method's functionality is closely related to managing override configurations, which seems to be a sensitive operation given the similar APIs' access control levels.
- The involvement of file operations and potential impacts on app compatibility or security configurations suggest that this method could have significant system implications if misused.

Considering the similarity in functionality with other APIs that are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, and the nature of the operations performed by `clearOverrideForTest`, it's reasonable to conclude that this API should also be classified under a similar access control level to ensure proper protection and authorization for its usage.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `clearOverrideForTest` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
