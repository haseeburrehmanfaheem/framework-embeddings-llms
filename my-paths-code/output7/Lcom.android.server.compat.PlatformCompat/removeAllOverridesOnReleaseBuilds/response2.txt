Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method appears to be related to compatibility overrides and release builds. It interacts with various objects and methods, including `CompatibilityOverridesToRemoveByPackageConfig`, `CompatConfig`, and `Overrides`. The method's code snippet shows that it performs operations such as iterating over collections, checking for known change IDs, and removing overrides.

The similar APIs provided have a high similarity score, indicating that they share similarities with the `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method. Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Analyzing the code snippets of the similar APIs, we can see that they perform operations such as:

* Checking if all compatibility overrides are overridable
* Removing package overrides
* Saving overrides
* Invalidating caches

These operations seem to be related to managing compatibility overrides and release builds, which is consistent with the `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method.

Considering the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method appears to perform similar operations that require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
