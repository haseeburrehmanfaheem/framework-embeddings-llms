To determine the access control level for the `clearOverrides` method, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `clearOverrides` method appears to be responsible for removing package overrides for a given package name (`p1`). It iterates through a collection of changes, removes package overrides for each change, and then saves the updated overrides to a file. If necessary, it also kills the UID associated with the package.

Comparing this functionality with the similar APIs:

1. `setOverrides(Lcom/android/internal/compat/CompatibilityChangeConfig;Ljava/lang/String;)V`: This method adds package overrides and then kills the package. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `clearOverride(JLjava/lang/String;)Z`: This method removes an override for a given package and then kills the package. Its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Given the similarities in functionality between `clearOverrides` and these APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `clearOverrides` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because all three methods interact with package overrides and killing UIDs, which are sensitive operations that require elevated permissions.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
