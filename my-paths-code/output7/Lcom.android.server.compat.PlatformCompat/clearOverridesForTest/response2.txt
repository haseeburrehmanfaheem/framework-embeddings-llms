To determine the access control level for the `clearOverridesForTest` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippets Analysis**: The code snippets for `clearOverridesForTest` show interactions with package managers, application info, and override configurations. It involves removing package overrides and saving changes to files, which suggests it deals with system-level configurations or data that could potentially be sensitive.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code provided interacts with compatibility configurations, override states, and file operations (reading/writing). This implies that the method is handling data that could affect system behavior or application compatibility, potentially impacting user experience or security.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds**: This API has a high similarity score with `clearOverridesForTest` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It adds all package overrides to the config, which suggests it operates on system-level data that requires either system or signature-level permissions.
   - **putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds**: Similar to the first API, this has a high similarity score and the same access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`). It checks for overridable compatibility overrides before adding package overrides, further indicating it deals with sensitive or system-level data.

Given these observations:
- The method `clearOverridesForTest` deals with system-level configurations and data.
- The similar APIs (`putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` and `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggesting they operate on sensitive system data that requires high permission levels.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the code snippets, sink code, and the similarity with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their interaction with system-level configurations and sensitive data, it is reasonable to conclude that `clearOverridesForTest` should also have a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
