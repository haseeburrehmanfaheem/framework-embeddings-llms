Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method interacts with the `Overrides` class, `CompatConfig` class, and file operations (e.g., `renameTo`, `createNewFile`). The method's purpose is to remove compatibility overrides on release builds.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9372891187667847 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It removes all package overrides on release builds.
2. `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9147920608520508 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It adds package overrides on release builds.

Both similar APIs have a SYS_OR_SIG access control level, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

The `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method's code snippet shows interactions with sensitive data (e.g., `CompatConfig`, `Overrides`) and file operations, which are similar to the operations performed by the similar APIs. Therefore, it is likely that this method also requires a SYS_OR_SIG access control level to ensure that only authorized entities can remove compatibility overrides on release builds.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method and its similar APIs, I assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to this method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
