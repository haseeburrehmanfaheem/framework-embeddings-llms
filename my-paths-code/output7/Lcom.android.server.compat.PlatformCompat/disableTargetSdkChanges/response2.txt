Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `disableTargetSdkChanges` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `disableTargetSdkChanges` method appears to be related to compatibility changes for packages, and it interacts with various components such as `PackageOverride`, `OverrideAllowedState`, and `CompatConfig`. The method also performs operations like adding package overrides, invalidating caches, and killing packages.

Looking at the similar APIs, we can observe that they have a high similarity score (> 0.97) with the `disableTargetSdkChanges` method. These similar APIs, `enableTargetSdkChanges`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

The sink code provided also indicates that the `disableTargetSdkChanges` method is interacting with sensitive components and performing operations that could potentially impact the system or other packages. Specifically, the method is:

1. Creating a `LongArray` and adding IDs to it.
2. Getting the enable state of target SDK changes for a package.
3. Enforcing override allowed states for packages.
4. Killing packages using `IActivityManager`.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that the `disableTargetSdkChanges` method requires a similar access control level as its similar APIs, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only system or signature-level components can execute this method and perform the necessary operations.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
