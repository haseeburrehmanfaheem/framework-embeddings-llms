To assign an access control level to the `reportChangeByPackageName` method, we must carefully review its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The method interacts with sensitive information such as package names, UIDs, and application info. It uses `LocalServices.getService(PackageManagerInterna.class)` to get an instance of `PackageManagerInterna`, which suggests that it requires system-level access or signature-level permission.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:
- The API `reportChangeByPackageName(JLjava/lang/String;I)V` has a similarity score of 0.9547637104988098 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with `PackageManagerInterna` and reports changes, which aligns with the behavior of the method in question.
- The API `reportChangeByUid(JI)V` has a similarity score of 0.8770630359649658 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although it reports changes by UID instead of package name, its system-level interaction and reporting nature are comparable.

Considering the method's interactions with system services, application info, and the similar APIs' access control levels, we can infer that the `reportChangeByPackageName` method requires a similar level of access control to perform its operations securely and effectively.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the method's need for system-level or signature-level permissions to interact with sensitive data and services securely.
