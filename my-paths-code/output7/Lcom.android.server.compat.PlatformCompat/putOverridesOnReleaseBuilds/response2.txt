To determine the access control level for the `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method, we need to analyze its code paths, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The method interacts with compatibility override configurations, checks for known change IDs, and modifies override settings. It also handles file operations related to storing overrides (e.g., creating, renaming, and deleting files). The presence of these operations indicates that the method could potentially impact system behavior or data integrity.

Let's examine the key aspects:

1. **Interaction with System Configurations**: The method accesses and modifies compatibility override configurations. This suggests it has some level of influence over how the system behaves in terms of compatibility, which is a sensitive aspect.

2. **File Operations**: It performs file operations like renaming, creating, and deleting files related to overrides. Such actions could potentially be used maliciously if not properly controlled, indicating a need for elevated access control.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API `setOverrides` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies that setting overrides is considered a sensitive operation requiring either system or signature-level permission.
   - Another similar API, `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, also has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This further supports the notion that operations involving compatibility overrides are subject to stricter access controls.

Given these points and considering the method's potential impact on system behavior and data integrity, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects its sensitivity and the need for proper authorization.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code paths, sink code, and similar APIs with their access control levels, the final access control level for the `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This choice aligns with the access control levels assigned to similar APIs that also deal with compatibility overrides and system configurations, reflecting the method's potential to influence system behavior and its involvement in sensitive operations.
