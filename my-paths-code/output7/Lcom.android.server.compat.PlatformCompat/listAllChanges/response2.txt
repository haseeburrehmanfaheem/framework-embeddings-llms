To determine the access control level for the `listAllChanges` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `listAllChanges` method iterates over a collection of changes (`this.mChanges.values()`) and constructs a `CompatibilityChangeInfo` object based on these changes. It does not seem to access or modify any sensitive data directly but deals with compatibility change information, which could be considered internal implementation details rather than user-sensitive data.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **listUIChanges**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows that it also deals with compatibility changes (`this.mCompatConfig.dumpChanges()`) and processes them in a stream. The similarity score is high (0.962494432926178), indicating that the functionality and possibly the required permissions are closely related to `listAllChanges`.
   - **getAppConfig**: With an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` as well, this method involves constructing a compatibility change configuration based on application information. Although its similarity score with `listAllChanges` is somewhat lower (0.8832776546478271), it also handles internal compatibility configurations.

Given these observations:
- Both similar APIs (`listUIChanges` and `getAppConfig`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that they require either system or signature-level permissions to access the necessary data.
- The `listAllChanges` method deals with internal implementation details related to compatibility changes, which are not typically considered sensitive user data but could still require restricted access due to their nature as system internals.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's functionality and its similarity to other APIs that have been classified as requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it is reasonable to conclude that `listAllChanges` should also be assigned a similar access control level. This ensures consistency in how related methods are secured within the system.
