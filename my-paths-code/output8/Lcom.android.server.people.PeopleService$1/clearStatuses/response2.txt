To determine the access control level for the `clearStatuses` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets for `clearStatuses` show different paths of execution but all lead to updating conversation information through `DataManager`. The key operations involve:

1. Handling incoming user checks.
2. Checking if the caller is the same app as the one associated with the conversation.
3. Updating or clearing statuses within a conversation.

The sink code points out specific lines where `ConversationInfo$Builder` is used to set statuses (in this case, clear them) and then update the conversation store, notifying listeners about changes.

Comparing this with similar APIs:

- The `clearStatus` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also updates a conversation status using `ConversationInfo$Builder`, similar to how `clearStatuses` operates.
- The `addOrUpdateStatus` method, with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, adds or updates a status within a conversation, which is conceptually close to clearing statuses.

Given these similarities and the fact that all these methods interact closely with sensitive data (conversation statuses) and require checks like `handleIncomingUser` and `checkCallerIsSameApp`, it suggests that they are dealing with operations that need to be restricted or monitored. The access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` for similar APIs indicates that these operations should only be performed by system or signature applications, or after a specific signature verification process.

Therefore, considering the nature of the operation (clearing conversation statuses), the checks involved (like same app and user handling), and the comparison with similar APIs (`clearStatus` and `addOrUpdateStatus`), it's reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `clearStatuses` method should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
