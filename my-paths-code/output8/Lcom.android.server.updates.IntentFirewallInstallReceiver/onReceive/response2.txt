To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

The provided code snippet for `onReceive` is:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
And the sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Both of these indicate that the method starts a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and calls its `start` method.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`. Their code snippets are almost identical to the one for `onReceive`, with the same operations being performed:
- Starting a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`.
- Calling the `start` method on this instance.

Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the semantics of the `onReceive` method, which involves receiving intents and potentially starting new processes or threads (as indicated by the creation and start of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`), we can infer that this operation does not inherently require special permissions or pose significant risks typically associated with `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` access control levels in a broad sense. The operations seem to be more related to internal handling of intents and updates rather than accessing sensitive user data, making system changes, or performing actions that would typically require higher access control levels.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
