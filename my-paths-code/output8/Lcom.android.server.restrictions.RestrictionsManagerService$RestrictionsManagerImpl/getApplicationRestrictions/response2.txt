Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getApplicationRestrictions` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they are sensitive and require a high level of restriction. These APIs interact with user restrictions, application restrictions, and device policy, which are all sensitive topics.

The `getApplicationRestrictions` method returns a `Bundle` containing application restrictions for a given user, which is similar to the data returned by the other APIs. Given the similarities in functionality and the sensitive nature of the data being accessed, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to this method.

Therefore, I conclude that the `getApplicationRestrictions` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is handling sensitive data related to application restrictions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
