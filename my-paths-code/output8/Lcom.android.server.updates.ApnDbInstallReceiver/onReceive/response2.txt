To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The given code snippet for `onReceive` is:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
And the sink code is essentially the same as the body of the `onReceive` method:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
The similar APIs provided have a similarity score very close to 1.0, indicating they are nearly identical in terms of functionality and structure to the `onReceive` method we're analyzing. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given this information:
- The code snippets for the `onReceive` method and its similar APIs are essentially performing the same operations (creating a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and starting it).
- The sink codes provided do not indicate any sensitive operations that would typically require elevated permissions or access control levels like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- All similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that the functionality implemented by these methods does not pose significant security risks or require special permissions.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`, as its functionality aligns closely with that of the similar APIs and does not indicate any operations that would necessitate a higher level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
