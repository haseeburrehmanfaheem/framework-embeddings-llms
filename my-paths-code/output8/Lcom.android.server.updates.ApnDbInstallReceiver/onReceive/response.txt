To analyze this code snippet according to the provided rules and identify potential sinks, we'll break down the instructions:

1. `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);` 
   - This line creates a new object of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. The creation of this object directly involves parameters passed to the API (`p2`, `p1`) and potentially another parameter or field (`p0`). Given that it uses data flow from the API parameters, it follows one of the positive rules for identifying sinks.

2. `v1.start();` 
   - This line invokes a method on the object created in the previous step. The method invocation is directly related to the object creation and thus continues the data flow initiated by the API's input parameters.

3. `return;`
   - This line simply ends the execution of the method without returning any value, as it's declared to return `void`. It does not contribute to a sink in terms of data flow or access control but marks the end of the method's execution.

Given these observations and applying the rules:

- The creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its subsequent method invocation (`v1.start()`) are directly linked through data flow (the object is created with API parameters and then an action is performed on it). This forms a coherent set of instructions that could be considered a sink, primarily because the new object's creation involves API input parameters.

The JSON representation of the identified sinks would be:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v1.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This sink is ranked as most sensitive because it directly involves the creation and manipulation of an object based on API input parameters, which could potentially be used to exploit access control vulnerabilities.
