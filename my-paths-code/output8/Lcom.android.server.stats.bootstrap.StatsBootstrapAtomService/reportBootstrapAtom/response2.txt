To determine the access control level for the `reportBootstrapAtom` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `reportBootstrapAtom` method is used to report bootstrap atom statistics. It involves creating a `StatsEvent` builder, setting an atom ID, writing byte arrays, and finally building and logging the event using `StatsLog.write`.

2. **Analyzing Paths**: All three paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) of the method involve similar operations:
   - Creating a `StatsEvent$Builder`.
   - Setting an atom ID based on `StatsBootstrapAtom.atomId`.
   - Writing byte arrays to the event builder.
   - Building the event and writing it to the log using `StatsLog.write`.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets provided all involve creating a `StatsEvent`, setting properties (like atom ID), writing data (byte arrays in this case), building the event, and logging it. This pattern is consistent across all paths of the `reportBootstrapAtom` method.

4. **Similar APIs**:
   - **reportPlaybackMetrics**: This API has an access control level of NONE. It involves creating a `StatsEvent`, setting an atom ID (320 in this case), and logging the event after adding various metrics.
   - **reportPlaybackStateEvent**: Also with an access control level of NONE, it creates a `StatsEvent`, sets an atom ID (322), adds state and time information, and logs the event.

5. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE.
   - The operations performed by `reportBootstrapAtom` are analogous to those in the similar APIs: creating a `StatsEvent`, setting properties, and logging it.
   - There's no indication that `reportBootstrapAtom` accesses sensitive information or performs actions that would require elevated permissions (like NORMAL, DANGEROUS, or SYS_OR_SIG).

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for the `reportBootstrapAtom` method seems to be NONE, as it aligns with the similar APIs provided and does not appear to involve sensitive operations or data.

**Final Access Control Level:**
