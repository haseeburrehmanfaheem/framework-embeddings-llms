Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getBundleSessionId` method.

The `getBundleSessionId` method generates a random session ID and returns it as a string. The method does not seem to access or modify any sensitive data, and its functionality is similar to other methods in the same class that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

The similar APIs provided, such as `getTranscodingSessionId`, `getPlaybackSessionId`, and `getRecordingSessionId`, all have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also generate random session IDs and return them as strings, without accessing or modifying sensitive data.

Given the similarities between these methods and the lack of sensitive data access or modification, I conclude that the `getBundleSessionId` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
