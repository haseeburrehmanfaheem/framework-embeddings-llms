To determine the access control level for the `reportPlaybackStateEvent` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show that the `reportPlaybackStateEvent` API logs a playback state event using the `StatsLog.write` method. This is similar to the behavior of the `reportTrackChangeEvent` and `reportPlaybackMetrics` APIs, which also log events using `StatsLog.write`.

All three APIs have similar code structures, with the main difference being the atom ID used in the `StatsEvent$Builder`. The `reportPlaybackStateEvent` API uses atom ID 322, while the other two APIs use different IDs (324 and 320).

The access control levels of the similar APIs are both `NONE`, indicating that they do not require any specific permissions or access controls to function.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the `reportPlaybackStateEvent` API also does not require any specific permissions or access controls. Therefore, its access control level should be `NONE`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
