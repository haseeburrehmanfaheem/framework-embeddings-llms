To determine the access control level for the `releaseSessionId` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of `releaseSessionId` Method**: The method takes two parameters, a `String` and an `int`, but it doesn't perform any operations; it simply returns without executing any code that could potentially interact with sensitive data or system resources.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code provided is essentially the same as the method's code snippet, indicating that there are no additional operations being performed beyond what's shown in the method itself.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **API Name**: `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest`
   - **Similarity Score**: 0.7282181978225708
   - **Access Control Level**: SYS_OR_SIG

Given this information, we need to consider why `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This level typically indicates that the API requires system or signature-level permission to execute, suggesting it interacts with sensitive system resources or capabilities.

However, looking at the provided code for both `releaseSessionId` and its similar API, neither performs any action that would require elevated permissions; they both simply return without executing any potentially sensitive operations. 

Despite this, the similarity in structure and the fact that a similar method (`revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest`) is classified as SYS_OR_SIG might suggest that `releaseSessionId` could be intended for system-level use or interacts with concepts (like session IDs) that are typically managed at a system level. 

But based strictly on the code provided and typical access control principles, since `releaseSessionId` does not perform any operations that directly interact with sensitive data or require special permissions to execute (as it essentially does nothing), one might argue for a less restrictive access control level.

Given the choices:
- NONE: Implies no access restrictions.
- NORMAL: Typical access without needing special system permissions.
- DANGEROUS: Requires careful consideration due to potential impact on user data or device functionality.
- SYS_OR_SIG: Requires system or signature-level permission, typically for operations that are sensitive or could impact system stability.

Considering the method does not execute any code and based on standard security principles where the least privilege necessary is granted, one might lean towards "NONE" as it doesn't perform any action. However, considering the context of similar APIs and potential implications of session management (even though not explicitly shown in this snippet), a cautious approach might still be warranted.

But strictly based on the information given and focusing on the principle of least privilege:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This conclusion is drawn because the method, as provided, does not perform any operations that would necessitate elevated access control levels. If additional context or the actual implementation details (not shown) imply interactions with sensitive resources, a reevaluation might be necessary.
