Since the provided code does not contain any method invocations, field access or updates, object creation, or data flows that follow at least one of the positive rules, and considering it's a very simple API with no operations other than returning immediately, we can conclude there are no sinks according to the given rules.

However, for completeness and following the instruction to consider all instructions as part of a sink for small APIs, we could technically include the entire method body as a single sink set due to its simplicity and lack of data flow. But strictly speaking, this does not adhere to the positive rules provided.

Given the constraints and focusing on providing an answer in the requested format while acknowledging that this API doesn't fit well with the criteria for identifying sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "public void releaseSessionId(String p1, int p2){",
      "return;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This approach considers the entire method as a single unit of execution, albeit not fitting perfectly into the defined rules for sink identification. In more complex APIs, such simple methods would likely be excluded based on the negative rules (e.g., auxiliary operations or lack of significant data processing).
