Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getEditingSessionId` method.

The `getEditingSessionId` method is a getter method that returns a session ID. The method generates a random session ID using `SecureRandom` and encodes it using `Base64`. The method does not modify any sensitive data or perform any critical operations that would require elevated access control.

Analyzing the similar APIs, we can see that:

* `getTranscodingSessionId`, `getBundleSessionId`, and `getPlaybackSessionId` have a similarity of 1.0 or close to 1.0 with the `getEditingSessionId` method and have an access control level of `NONE`.
* `getRecordingSessionId` has a lower similarity but still has an access control level of `NONE`.
* `createSession` has a lower similarity and requires a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`) because it creates a new session, which is a more critical operation.

Considering the similarities and the nature of the `getEditingSessionId` method, I conclude that it does not require elevated access control. Therefore, the assigned access control level for the `getEditingSessionId` method is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the method only generates and returns a random session ID without modifying any sensitive data or performing critical operations. The similar APIs with high similarity also have an access control level of `NONE`, which supports this decision.
