To determine the access control level for the `reportTrackChangeEvent` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `reportTrackChangeEvent` method has three paths with different depths. All paths ultimately lead to writing a `StatsEvent` to the `StatsLog`. The method checks the logging level and only writes the event if the level is not 99999.

The similar APIs, `reportPlaybackErrorEvent` and `reportPlaybackStateEvent`, also write `StatsEvent`s to the `StatsLog` and have a similarity score of 0.9209 and 0.8699, respectively. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given that all three methods are similar in functionality and purpose, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to `reportTrackChangeEvent`. The fact that they all write to the `StatsLog` without any explicit permission checks or sensitive data handling suggests that they do not require elevated permissions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity with other APIs, the access control level for the `reportTrackChangeEvent` method should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is made considering the similarities in code structure and functionality between `reportTrackChangeEvent` and the provided similar APIs, as well as the lack of explicit permission checks or handling of sensitive data within these methods.
