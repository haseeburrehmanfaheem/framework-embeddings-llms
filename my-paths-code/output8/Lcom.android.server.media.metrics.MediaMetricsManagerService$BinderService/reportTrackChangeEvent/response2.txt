To determine the access control level for the `reportTrackChangeEvent` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `reportTrackChangeEvent` method logs track change events using the `StatsEvent` builder. It checks the logging level and only logs the event if the level is not 99999. The method also checks the mode and block list before logging the event.

Comparing this method with similar APIs, we can see that:

* `reportPlaybackErrorEvent`, `reportPlaybackStateEvent`, and `reportPlaybackMetrics` all log events using the `StatsEvent` builder and have a similarity score above 0.7.
* These methods do not have any specific access control checks, and their access control level is set to `NONE`.
* The `reportBootstrapAtom` method also logs an event using the `StatsEvent` builder, but it has a lower similarity score (around 0.8).
* The `onWakeupEvent` method has a low similarity score (around 0.7) and uses a different logging mechanism.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the `reportTrackChangeEvent` method is similar to other methods that log events using the `StatsEvent` builder and do not have specific access control checks. Therefore, its access control level should be set to `NONE`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
