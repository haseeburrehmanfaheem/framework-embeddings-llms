To determine the access control level for the `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with different conditions and actions:
   - Path 1 (depth 1) checks if the calling UID is 1001 and not 1000 before proceeding with granting permissions.
   - Path 2 (depth 0) enforces that the caller must be either a system or phone caller using `PackageManagerServiceUtils.enforceSystemOrPhoneCaller` before granting permissions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet provided also checks for UID 1001 and then proceeds to grant permissions, similar to path 1 of the method.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps`: This API has a high similarity score (0.9850553274154663) with `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp`. It requires the caller to be either system or signature, as inferred from its access control level being `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `getTasks`: Although it has a lower similarity score (0.8579557538032532), its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that system or signature privileges are required.

Given these points:

- The method's paths indicate checks for specific UIDs and enforcement of system or phone caller status, suggesting restrictions on who can call this method.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, implying that only system or apps signed with the platform signature can call them.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate access control level for `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the restrictions and privileges observed in its code paths and similar APIs.
