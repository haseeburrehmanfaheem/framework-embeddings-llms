To determine the access control level for the `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp` method, we need to analyze the provided information, including the code snippets of the method itself and its similar APIs along with their assigned access control levels.

1. **Analysis of the Method**: The `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp` method has two paths:
   - Path 1 checks if the calling UID is 1001 and then performs an action if it's not equal to 1000, which seems to be a specific condition for handling permissions.
   - Path 2 directly enforces system or phone caller check using `PackageManagerServiceUtils.enforceSystemOrPhoneCaller`, indicating that this method should only be callable by system or phone processes.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - All similar APIs provided (`grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps`, `getTasks`, `cancelAuthorization`, `clearPassword`, and `generateCinematicEffect`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that they are all protected to be accessed only by system or signature holders, which typically includes system processes or apps signed with the platform key.
   - The presence of `Binder.getCallingUid()` in these APIs indicates a check for the caller's identity, and subsequent actions are based on this check. The use of `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level implies that these methods are sensitive and should only be accessible to trusted callers.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that all similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it suggests that the operations they perform (and by extension, the operation performed by `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp`) are sensitive and require a high level of trust.
   - The method's Path 2 explicitly enforces system or phone caller check, aligning with the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control principle.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it handles sensitive operations related to granting permissions and its similar APIs are protected at the same level.
