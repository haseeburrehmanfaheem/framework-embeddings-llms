Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps` method.

The method is used to grant default permissions to enabled carrier apps, which suggests that it requires a certain level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications. The similar APIs provided also suggest that this method should have a high level of access control.

The API `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that only system or signature apps can call this method. Similarly, the other similar APIs (`getTasks`, `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps`, `grantDefaultPermissionsToCarrierServiceApp`, and `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledTelephonyDataServices`) also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given that these similar APIs require a high level of access control, it is likely that the `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps` method should also have a similar level of access control.

Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity between the APIs and the potential security risks associated with granting default permissions to enabled carrier apps. By requiring a system or signature app to call this method, we can ensure that only authorized entities can modify the permissions of carrier apps.
