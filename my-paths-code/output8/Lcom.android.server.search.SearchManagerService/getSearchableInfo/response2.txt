Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getSearchableInfo` method.

The similar APIs (`getGlobalSearchActivity`, `getGlobalSearchActivities`, and `getSearchablesInGlobalSearch`) all have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods seem to be related to retrieving search-related information, which is similar to what the `getSearchableInfo` method does.

Upon reviewing the code snippets for the `getSearchableInfo` method, I notice that it performs checks such as `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` and `canAccessComponent` to ensure that the caller has the necessary permissions. However, these checks do not necessarily imply a higher access control level.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the fact that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getSearchableInfo` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the analysis of similar APIs and the semantics of the `getSearchableInfo` method, which suggests that it does not require a higher access control level.
