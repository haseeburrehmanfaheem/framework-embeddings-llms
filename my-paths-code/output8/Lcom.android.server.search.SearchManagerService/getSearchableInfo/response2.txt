To determine the access control level for the `getSearchableInfo` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs. The provided code snippets show different paths of execution for the `getSearchableInfo` method, but they all seem to involve retrieving or updating searchable information related to a given `ComponentName`.

The key aspects to consider when assigning an access control level are:

1. **Interaction with Sensitive Data**: Does the method access or modify sensitive user data or system settings?
2. **Impact on System Security**: Could the method's execution potentially compromise system security, such as by allowing unauthorized access to components or data?
3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**: How do similar APIs behave in terms of access control?

Given these considerations:

- The `getSearchableInfo` method interacts with searchable information and component names, which could be considered sensitive in certain contexts.
- It updates internal maps (`this.mSearchablesMap`) based on the provided `ComponentName`, which might have implications for system security if not properly validated.
- The similar APIs (`getGlobalSearchActivity` and `getWebSearchActivity`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that they do not pose significant risks to system security or sensitive data. However, these methods seem to primarily focus on updating searchable lists without the complex conditional checks and component access validations present in `getSearchableInfo`.

Despite the similarities, `getSearchableInfo` includes additional checks (e.g., `canAccessComponent`) that imply a level of scrutiny regarding who can access certain components, suggesting it might handle more sensitive operations compared to the similar APIs.

However, based on the provided information and focusing strictly on the access control levels defined (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), and considering that the method does involve checks for accessing components but seems to be more about retrieving information rather than performing dangerous operations:

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
