Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getGlobalSearchActivity` method.

The `getGlobalSearchActivity` method is used to retrieve the global search activity for a given user. The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately lead to retrieving the global search activity.

Upon analyzing the similar APIs provided, we can see that:

* `getWebSearchActivity` has an access control level of NONE.
* `getGlobalSearchActivities` has an access control level of NONE.
* `getSearchableInfo` has an access control level of NONE.
* `getSearchablesInGlobalSearch` has an access control level of NONE.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, which suggests that retrieving search-related information is not considered sensitive and does not require any specific access control.

Additionally, the method `getGlobalSearchActivity` does not modify any data or perform any actions that could potentially pose a security risk. It only retrieves information, which is generally less sensitive than modifying data.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the semantics of the `getGlobalSearchActivity` method, I conclude that the access control level for this method should be NONE.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
