To determine the access control level for the `getUidsWithPolicy` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getUidsWithPolicy` method appears to interact with user ID policies (`mUidPolicy`) and returns an array of UIDs based on a given policy. The method does not seem to modify any system settings or perform actions that require high-level permissions directly within its provided code snippet. However, the interaction with `mUidPolicy` suggests it deals with sensitive information regarding user IDs and their associated policies.

The similar APIs provided, `factoryReset(Ljava/lang/String;)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods seem to perform more critical operations such as resetting the factory settings and setting UID policies unchecked, which are actions that typically require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on the device's state and security.

Given the nature of `getUidsWithPolicy`, it does not appear to perform actions as sensitive or impactful as those in the `factoryReset` methods. It primarily retrieves information based on existing policies without modifying system settings directly. However, its interaction with user ID policies could still be considered sensitive.

Considering these points and comparing with the similar APIs:

- The method does not seem to require system-level permissions for its operation based on the provided code.
- It deals with sensitive information but does so in a read-only manner without direct system modifications.

Therefore, the access control level for `getUidsWithPolicy` would likely be less restrictive than `SYS_OR_SIG` but still recognizes the method's handling of potentially sensitive user policy data. Between `NONE`, `NORMAL`, and `DANGEROUS`, given its nature, it seems most appropriate to categorize it as `NORMAL`, acknowledging that while it handles sensitive information, it does so in a manner that is less directly impactful than methods requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` permissions.
