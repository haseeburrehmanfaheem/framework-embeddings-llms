To determine the access control level for the `getUidsWithPolicy` method in the `NetworkPolicyManagerService` class, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `factoryReset` and `getUidPolicy`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The `getUidsWithPolicy` method interacts with the `mUidPolicy` data structure, which seems to store policies for different UIDs (User IDs). This method returns an array of UIDs that match a given policy. The logic inside the method suggests it's filtering UIDs based on their associated policies and the input parameter `p1`.

Given that:
- The similar API `factoryReset` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute, likely due to its ability to reset network policies.
- The `getUidPolicy` method also has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggesting that reading the policy for a specific UID is considered sensitive and requires appropriate permissions.

Considering these points:
- The `getUidsWithPolicy` method is essentially reading data (UIDs with certain policies) rather than modifying it. However, since the corresponding setter methods or similar APIs (`factoryReset`, `setUidPolicyUncheckedUL`) require high-level access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`), and given that `getUidPolicy` also requires `SYS_OR_SIG`, it implies that the information about UIDs and their policies is sensitive.

Therefore, even though reading data might generally be considered less sensitive than writing, in this context, due to the sensitivity of the data (UIDs and their network policies) and the access control levels of similar APIs, the `getUidsWithPolicy` method should also have a restrictive access control level to protect the privacy and security of user data.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects the need to protect sensitive information about user IDs and their associated network policies, aligning with the access control levels assigned to similar methods within the `NetworkPolicyManagerService` class.
