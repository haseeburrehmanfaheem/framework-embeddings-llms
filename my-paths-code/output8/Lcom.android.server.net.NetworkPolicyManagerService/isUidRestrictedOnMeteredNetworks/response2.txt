To determine the access control level for the `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` method in the `NetworkPolicyManagerService` class, we should consider the sensitivity of the data it accesses and the potential risks associated with its functionality.

1. **Similar API Analysis**: The provided similar API, `isUidNetworkingBlocked(IZ)Z`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the operations related to checking or modifying network restrictions for specific UIDs are considered sensitive and should be restricted to system or signature-level access. The similarity in functionality between `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` and `isUidNetworkingBlocked` implies that they might handle similar types of sensitive data.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code `Object v2 = this.mUidBlockedState.get(p1);` indicates that the method accesses the blocked state of a specific UID (`p1`). This operation involves reading data related to network restrictions, which can be considered less sensitive than modifying such data. However, given the context of network policy management, even reading this information could potentially reveal sensitive details about how the system manages network access for different applications or users.

3. **Access Control Principles**: In Android, if a getter method is protected, it implies that the corresponding setter should have an equal or higher level of access control. Since `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` is essentially a getter method (it retrieves information about whether a UID is restricted on metered networks), its access control level should be considered in the context of protecting sensitive data.

Given these considerations:

- The method's functionality and similarity to other APIs with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggest that it handles sensitive information.
- Reading network restriction data, while less risky than writing it, still involves accessing potentially sensitive system configuration details.

Therefore, assigning an access control level of `NORMAL` might not be sufficient due to the method's involvement in network policy management, which is a system-level functionality. However, without direct evidence that this specific getter method poses a significant risk if accessed by non-system or non-signature applications, we must weigh the need for protection against the principle of least privilege.

Considering these factors and the provided similar API's access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`), but also acknowledging that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing it, the most appropriate access control level for `isUidRestrictedOnMeteredNetworks` would be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects a balance between protecting system integrity and allowing necessary access for legitimate applications, given that there's no clear indication from the provided information that this method's data is so sensitive it requires `SYS_OR_SIG` protection.
