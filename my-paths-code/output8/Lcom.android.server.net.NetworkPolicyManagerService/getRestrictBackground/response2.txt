To determine the access control level for the `getRestrictBackground` method in the `NetworkPolicyManagerService` class, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getRestrictBackground` method simply returns a boolean value indicating whether background data is restricted. This operation does not modify any system settings or sensitive data; it only reads the current state.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getRestrictBackgroundStatus(I)I` and `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller()I`) have an access control level of `NORMAL`. These methods are involved in determining the status of background data restriction, either by internal status or based on the caller's UID. Their operations are slightly more complex than just returning a boolean state, as they involve additional logic to determine the restriction status.
   - The key point here is that these similar APIs deal with retrieving information related to background data restrictions and have been assigned a `NORMAL` access control level.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - In Android, reading data (as in the case of getter methods) generally poses less risk than writing data (setter methods). Therefore, if a setter method requires a certain level of access control, the corresponding getter might require less or the same level of restriction.
   - Given that the similar APIs (`getRestrictBackgroundStatus` and `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller`) are assigned `NORMAL` access control and considering they perform slightly more complex operations related to background data restriction status, we can infer that retrieving the simple boolean state of background restriction (`getRestrictBackground`) would likely not require a higher level of access control.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `getRestrictBackground` only returns a boolean indicating whether background data is restricted and does not modify any system settings or sensitive information, it aligns with the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive.
   - Considering the similar APIs have a `NORMAL` access control level for more complex operations related to the same domain (background data restriction), assigning `NONE` could be reasonable because it's a simple getter method that doesn't modify system state or expose sensitive information. However, given the context and similarities with other methods in the same class that deal with network policy management, aligning with the least privilege principle but also considering standard practices for such manager services, `NORMAL` seems like an appropriate choice to ensure consistency and security within the service's operations.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision balances the need for security with the operational requirements of the method, ensuring that while it does not pose a significant risk by itself, it still adheres to a standard level of access control expected within the network policy management service.
