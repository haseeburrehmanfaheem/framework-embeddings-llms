To determine the access control level for the `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method, we should consider the following factors:

1. **Similarity with other APIs**: The provided similar APIs (`setSubscriptionOverride` and `setSubscriptionPlans`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to subscription plans are considered sensitive and require a higher level of access control.

2. **Semantics of the API**: The `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method retrieves information about the owner of subscription plans, which could be considered less sensitive than setting or modifying subscription plans. However, given the context that reading data is generally less sensitive but still related to potentially sensitive information (subscription plans), it's reasonable to consider a moderate level of access control.

3. **Access Control Principle**: If a setter method requires a high level of access control (`SYS_OR_SIG` in this case), the corresponding getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading data is generally less risky than writing. However, since both similar APIs provided are setters with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control and there's no direct getter comparison, we should consider the nature of the data being accessed.

Given these considerations:

- The similarity in functionality (dealing with subscription plans) suggests that some level of restriction is necessary.
- The principle that getters can have lower restrictions than setters but still require protection due to the sensitive nature of the data they handle.
- The specific access control levels provided for similar APIs are `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating a need for system or signature-level permission, which is typically reserved for operations that significantly impact system functionality or security.

However, since `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` is a getter and not a setter, and considering the general principle that reading data is less sensitive than modifying it, we might lean towards a slightly less restrictive access control compared to the setters. Yet, given the context of managing subscription plans and the lack of a clear precedent for a getter in the provided information, aligning with the more secure approach taken by similar APIs seems prudent.

Therefore, considering the need to protect sensitive data related to subscription plans but also acknowledging that reading this data is less risky than modifying it, we should still apply a significant level of access control. Given the options and the context:

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
This choice reflects a balance between protecting sensitive information and recognizing that reading data (in this case, about subscription plans owners) poses a lesser risk compared to modifying such data. However, without a direct comparison to another getter method in the provided context, and considering the principle of least privilege, `NORMAL` access control seems an appropriate assignment given the information at hand.
