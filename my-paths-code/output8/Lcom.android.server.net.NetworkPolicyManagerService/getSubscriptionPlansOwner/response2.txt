To determine the access control level for the `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar API 1: `setSubscriptionOverride(III[IJLjava/lang/String;)V`**
   - Access Control Level: `SYS_OR_SIG`
   - This API interacts with subscription plans by checking if an array is empty (`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(v44)`). The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control suggests that this operation requires either system or signature-level permission, likely due to its involvement in managing or overriding subscription settings.

2. **Similar API 2: `setSubscriptionPlans(I[Landroid/telephony/SubscriptionPlan;JLjava/lang/String;)V`**
   - Access Control Level: `SYS_OR_SIG`
   - This method updates subscription plans (`this.mSubscriptionPlans.put(p1, p2)`) and sends a broadcast with the permission `"android.permission.MANAGE_SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS"`. The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the caller's UID and the specific permission for managing subscription plans indicates that this operation is sensitive and requires system or signature-level access control.

Given these examples, we can infer that operations related to subscription plans, whether reading or modifying them, are considered sensitive. They often require specific permissions to protect user data and ensure that only authorized processes can alter or access such information.

The `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` method retrieves the owner of a subscription plan based on an input parameter (`int p1`). Although it's a read operation rather than a write operation like the similar APIs provided, accessing sensitive information about subscription plans could still be considered a privileged action. This is because knowing who owns a particular subscription plan could potentially reveal sensitive user or account information.

However, since `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` does not modify any data and seems to only retrieve existing information without any explicit permission checks mentioned in the code snippet (like sending broadcasts with specific permissions), it might not require the highest level of access control like `SYS_OR_SIG`. But, considering the sensitivity of the information it handles and for consistency with how similar operations are secured, assigning a moderate level of access control seems prudent.

Given the choices:
- `NONE`: Implies no access control is needed, which seems inappropriate given the context.
- `NORMAL`: Suggests a standard level of protection that might be applicable but could be too lenient considering the sensitivity of subscription plan information.
- `DANGEROUS`: Indicates a high risk if misused, which aligns with the handling of sensitive user data but might be more appropriate for operations that modify data rather than just read it.
- `SYS_OR_SIG`: Requires system or signature-level permission, typically used for operations that significantly impact the system or user data security.

Considering these points and aiming to balance between protecting sensitive information and the nature of the operation (read-only), one might lean towards a more restrictive access control. However, since the method is read-only and doesn't explicitly handle or modify sensitive data in a way that's directly harmful if accessed improperly (unlike operations that change system settings or user data), the most fitting choice based on the provided similar APIs and their access control levels would be to align with the protective stance taken for related methods but also consider the nature of this specific method.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
This decision reflects a balance, considering that while `getSubscriptionPlansOwner` deals with potentially sensitive information, it does so in a read-only capacity and doesn't explicitly involve system-altering operations or broadcasts that would necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` access control. However, without explicit evidence of permission checks or handling of particularly dangerous data (like financial information directly), `NORMAL` seems a reasonable choice to ensure some level of protection while acknowledging the method's functionality.
