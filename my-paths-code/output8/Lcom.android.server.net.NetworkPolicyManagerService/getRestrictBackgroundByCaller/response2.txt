To determine the access control level for the `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of the Method**: The `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` method has two paths:
   - Path 1 returns a constant value (`v3 = 3;`) without any conditional checks based on the caller's UID.
   - Path 2 calls `getRestrictBackgroundStatusInternal(v2)` where `v2` is the caller's UID, suggesting that the return value depends on the caller's identity.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `getServiceDeviceInfo` has an access control level of `NONE`, but it involves checking if a UID is allowed (`isUidAllowed(v1)`), which implies some form of permission or access control check.
   - `getRestrictBackgroundStatus` has an access control level of `NORMAL`. This method seems to be related in functionality to `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` as both deal with background restriction status, but the exact implications of `NORMAL` access control are not detailed here.
   - `createSession` and `openDevice` both have `NONE` access control levels. These methods involve getting the caller's UID and possibly other identifiers but do not seem to directly influence or reflect the security sensitivity of `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller`.
   - `clearPassword` has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to its sensitive nature of clearing passwords.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` involves checking the caller's UID and potentially returns sensitive information regarding background data usage restrictions, some form of access control is warranted.
   - The method does not seem to modify any state but rather retrieves information based on the caller's identity. Thus, it might not require as high a level of protection as methods that can alter system or user data (like `clearPassword`).
   - Considering the similarities with `getRestrictBackgroundStatus`, which has an access control level of `NORMAL`, and given that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing it, `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` likely requires at least a `NORMAL` level of access control to ensure that the information about background data usage restrictions is not indiscriminately available.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and considering the principles of Android's access control, where reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it but still warrants some protection, especially when related to system or user-specific settings like background data usage, `getRestrictBackgroundByCaller` should have an access control level that reflects its need for controlled access without being overly restrictive.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice balances the need to protect the information about background data restrictions with the understanding that this method does not modify system state, aligning with the access control levels observed in similar APIs.
