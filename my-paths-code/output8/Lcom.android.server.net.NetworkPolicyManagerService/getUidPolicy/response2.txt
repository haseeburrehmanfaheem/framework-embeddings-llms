Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, we can make an informed decision about the access control level for the `getUidPolicy` method.

The `getUidPolicy` method is a getter method that returns the policy for a given UID. The similar APIs provided are all setter methods or methods that modify the policy in some way, and they all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that modifying the policy requires a high level of access control.

However, as mentioned in the problem statement, if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level. In this case, since the setter methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's likely that the getter method `getUidPolicy` should have a lower or equal access control level.

Given that the `getUidsWithPolicy` method, which is also a getter method, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's possible that the `getUidPolicy` method should also have a similar access control level. However, since reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, a lower access control level such as `NORMAL` could also be appropriate.

After careful consideration, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getUidPolicy` method, as it is a getter method that only returns information and does not modify any data.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
