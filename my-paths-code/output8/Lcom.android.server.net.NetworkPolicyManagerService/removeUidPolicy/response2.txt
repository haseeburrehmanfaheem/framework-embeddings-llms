Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `removeUidPolicy` API.

The `removeUidPolicy` API has similarities with other APIs that have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Specifically:

* `addUidPolicy(II)V` in `Lcom.android.server.net.NetworkPolicyManagerService` has a similarity of 0.9999998807907104 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `setUidPolicy(II)V` in `Lcom.android.server.net.NetworkPolicyManagerService` has a similarity of 0.9700804948806763 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock(ZI)V` in `Lcom.android.server.locksettings.LockSettingsService` has a similarity of 0.935772716999054 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout(I)V` in `Lcom.android.server.locksettings.LockSettingsService` has a similarity of 0.9282615780830383 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

These similar APIs suggest that the `removeUidPolicy` API should have a similar access control level, as they all seem to be related to system-level operations that require elevated privileges.

On the other hand, the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync(Landroid/os/IBinder;)V` API in `Lcom.android.server.inputmethod.InputMethodManagerService` has a similarity of 0.921485960483551 but an access control level of `NONE`. However, this API seems to be related to input method management, which is a different domain than network policy management.

Considering the similarities and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I conclude that the `removeUidPolicy` API should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is likely to require system-level privileges to modify network policies.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
