Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similarities and access control levels of the given APIs to determine the appropriate access control level for the `onDestroyPredictionSession` method.

All the similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. The similarities between these APIs and the `onDestroyPredictionSession` method are high, ranging from 0.846 to 0.979, indicating that they share similar functionality and potentially interact with the same sinks.

The sink code entries for the `onDestroyPredictionSession` method also show similarities with the sink code entries of the other APIs, which further supports the idea that they require similar access control levels.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onDestroyPredictionSession` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is likely to interact with sensitive data or system resources that require system or signature-level permission to access.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
