Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method.

The similar APIs have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to app prediction and session management, and they all interact with the same sinks as the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method.

Given the similarities in code structure and sink interactions between the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method and the similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `notifyAppTargetEvent` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
