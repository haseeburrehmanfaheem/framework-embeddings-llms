Based on the provided information, we can analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `requestPredictionUpdate` method.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to app prediction and session management, which are sensitive operations that require proper authorization.

The `requestPredictionUpdate` method is also related to app prediction and session management, as it updates the prediction session with new data. Given its similarity to the other APIs, it is likely that this method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `requestPredictionUpdate` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
