To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we should consider the similarity in code and functionality with the provided similar APIs. Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and their code snippets are nearly identical to the one provided for the `onReceive` method. The key aspects to consider include:

1. **Similarity in Code**: The code snippets provided for the similar APIs are essentially the same as the one for the `onReceive` method. This suggests that these methods perform very similar, if not identical, operations.

2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This indicates that the operations performed by these methods do not require special permissions or pose significant risks to the system or user data.

3. **Semantics and Functionality**: The method `onReceive` is typically used in the context of broadcast receivers, which are components of Android applications that can respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. The fact that it starts a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` suggests it's involved in updating configurations or handling installation-related events. However, without explicit interactions with sensitive data or system resources that require elevated permissions, there's no clear indication that this method would need a higher access control level.

Given these considerations and the fact that the similar APIs have been assigned `NONE` as their access control level, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This decision is based on the similarity in code, functionality, and the lack of any apparent need for elevated permissions or special system access.
