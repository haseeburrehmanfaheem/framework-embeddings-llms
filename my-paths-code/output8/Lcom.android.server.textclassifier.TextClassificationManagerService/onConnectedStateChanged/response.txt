Since the method `onConnectedStateChanged` does not contain any instructions that follow the positive rules (i.e., it does not invoke methods, access or update fields, create new objects, or return values related to its parameters), and considering the negative rules do not apply here as there are no generic utility methods, logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, or auxiliary operations, we can conclude that this API does not contain any sinks according to the provided rules.

However, given the instruction to consider all instructions as part of a sink for small APIs, and since this API is very simple with only one line that directly returns without performing any operation related to its parameter `p1`, we could argue that the entire method constitutes a single, albeit not very sensitive, sink due to its simplicity and lack of data processing.

Thus, the JSON representation would be:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "public void onConnectedStateChanged(int p1){",
      "return;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This represents the entire method as a single set of instructions that collectively form a potential sink, albeit with minimal sensitivity due to its lack of interaction with the input parameter `p1`.
