Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `onSelectionEvent` method.

The method has three paths with different depths, and it interacts with several sinks, including:

* `TextClassificationManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3 v5 = new TextClassificationManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3(p1,p2);`
* `int v11 = UserHandle.getCallingUserId();`
* `SystemTextClassifierMetadata v2 = this.mSystemTcMetadata;`
* `p0.handleRequest(v4, 1, 1, v5, "onSelectionEvent", this.NO_OP_CALLBACK);`

The similar APIs provided have a high similarity score and are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with similar sinks, such as:

* `TextClassificationManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda9 v5 = new TextClassificationManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda9(p1,p2,p3);`
* `TextClassificationManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda6 v5 = new TextClassificationManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda6(p1,p2,p3);`

Considering the similarities between the `onSelectionEvent` method and the provided APIs, it is likely that the access control level for `onSelectionEvent` should be similar.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `onSelectionEvent` method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
