Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `onSelectionEvent` method.

The reasoning behind this decision is as follows:

1. The `onSelectionEvent` method has a high similarity with other methods in the same class that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods include `onGenerateLinks`, `onSuggestSelection`, `onTextClassifierEvent`, `onSuggestConversationActions`, and `onClassifyText`.
2. The sink code entries for these similar methods also show similarities with the sink code entries for the `onSelectionEvent` method, such as the creation of synthetic lambda objects and the use of `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`.
3. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level is typically used for system or signature-protected APIs, which suggests that these methods are intended to be used by system-level components or applications with a specific signature.
4. Given the similarities between the `onSelectionEvent` method and the other methods in the same class, it is likely that this method is also intended to be used by system-level components or applications with a specific signature.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `onSelectionEvent` method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
