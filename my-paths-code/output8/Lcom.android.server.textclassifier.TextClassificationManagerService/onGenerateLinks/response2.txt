To determine the access control level for the `onGenerateLinks` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show that the `onGenerateLinks` API interacts with various objects and services, including `TextClassificationSessionId`, `TextLinks$Request`, `ITextClassifierCallback`, and `SystemTextClassifierMetadata`. The API also uses lambda expressions and binder calls to handle requests.

Comparing this API with similar ones, such as `onSuggestSelection` and `onSelectionEvent`, we can see that they share similarities in their code structure and the use of lambda expressions. These similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Given the similarities between these APIs, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `onGenerateLinks` API. Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I conclude that the access control level for the `onGenerateLinks` API should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
