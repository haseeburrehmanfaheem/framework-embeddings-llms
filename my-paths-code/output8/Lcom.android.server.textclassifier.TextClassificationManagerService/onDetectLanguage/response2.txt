Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `onDetectLanguage` API.

The `onDetectLanguage` API has three paths with different depths, and it interacts with various sinks, including `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`, `TextClassificationManagerService.getUserStateLocked(v11)`, and `handleRequest(v4, 1, 1, v5, "onDetectLanguage", p3)`.

The similar APIs provided, `onSuggestSelection` and `onClassifyText`, have a similarity score of 0.9122413396835327 and 0.8338622450828552, respectively, with the `onDetectLanguage` API. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The code snippets for these similar APIs show that they also interact with the same sinks as the `onDetectLanguage` API, such as `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` and `handleRequest(v4, 1, 1, v5, "onClassifyText", p3)`.

Given the similarities between the `onDetectLanguage` API and the provided similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `onDetectLanguage` API should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
