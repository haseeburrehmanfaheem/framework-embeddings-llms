Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `removePrintJobStateChangeListener` API.

The `removePrintJobStateChangeListener` API has a high similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs include:

* `addPrintJobStateChangeListener`: Similarity 0.8987495303153992, Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
* `removePrintServicesChangeListener`: Similarity 0.8957398533821106, Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
* `restartPrintJob`: Similarity 0.8666536211967468, Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
* `setPrintServiceEnabled`: Similarity 0.8345696926116943, Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG

The sink code for the `removePrintJobStateChangeListener` API also involves getting or creating a `UserState` object and calling a method on it, which is similar to the sink code of other APIs with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering these factors, I conclude that the `removePrintJobStateChangeListener` API should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is similar to other APIs that require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive print job state change listener functionality.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
