To determine the access control level for the `getPrintJobInfos` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `getPrintJobInfos` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path involves checking user states, getting print jobs for a running app, and interacting with the remote print spooler.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path involves getting or creating a user state, clearing calling identity, and retrieving print jobs from the print job cache or the spooler.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path simply returns null.

The sink code provided interacts with user states, print job caches, and the remote print spooler, which are similar to the operations performed in the `getPrintJobInfos` method.

Comparing the `getPrintJobInfos` method with the similar APIs:

* The `restartPrintJob` API has a similarity score of 0.9205911159515381 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It interacts with user states, print job info, and the spooler, which are similar to the operations in the `getPrintJobInfos` method.
* The `setLightStates` API has a similarity score of 0.8938586115837097 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Although it deals with light states, its interaction with native code and state management is somewhat similar to the `getPrintJobInfos` method.

Considering the similarities in code paths and interactions with system components, I would assign an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG** to the `getPrintJobInfos` method. This is because the method interacts with sensitive system components, such as user states and the remote print spooler, which require a higher level of access control.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
