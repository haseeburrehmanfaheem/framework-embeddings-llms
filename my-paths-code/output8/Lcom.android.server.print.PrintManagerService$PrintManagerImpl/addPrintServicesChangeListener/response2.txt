To determine the access control level for the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `addPrintJobStateChangeListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `setPrintServiceEnabled`: SYS_OR_SIG
4. `isPrintServiceEnabled`: NONE
5. `removePrintServicesChangeListener`: SYS_OR_SIG

The similarities between these APIs and `addPrintServicesChangeListener` are high, ranging from 0.88 to 0.95. This suggests that they share similar functionality and may require similar access control levels.

All the similar APIs with high similarity (above 0.88) have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, except for `isPrintServiceEnabled`, which has a level of NONE. However, `isPrintServiceEnabled` is a getter method, and as mentioned in the problem statement, getter methods typically require less restrictive access control than setter methods.

Given that `addPrintServicesChangeListener` is a setter method (it adds a listener), it's likely to require a more restrictive access control level than a getter method. The high similarity with other SYS_OR_SIG APIs suggests that `addPrintServicesChangeListener` should also have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the final access control level for the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
