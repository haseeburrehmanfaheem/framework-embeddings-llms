To determine the access control level for the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them eventually lead to adding a listener to a list (`mPrintServicesChangeListenerRecords`). This operation involves interacting with system-level services and user states.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve getting or creating a `UserState` object and adding a new listener to the records. These operations are related to managing user interactions with print services, which can be sensitive in terms of system security and privacy.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `addPrintJobStateChangeListener`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It's similar in that it also deals with adding a listener for changes in print job states.
   - `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener`: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and it involves adding a listener for recommendations regarding print services.

Given the similarities between these APIs, including their operations on system-level user states and listener records, and considering that they all have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, we can infer that the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` method should also be treated with a similar level of caution and access restriction.

The reason for assigning `SYS_OR_SIG` (which stands for either system or signature) is because these operations are typically restricted to system-level components or applications that have a specific signature (i.e., they are signed with the platform key), indicating they are part of the system or trusted applications. This level of access control prevents arbitrary applications from accessing or modifying sensitive user data or system settings without proper authorization.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, the `addPrintServicesChangeListener` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
