To determine the access control level for the `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code paths for `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` involve interactions with user states and listener records. Specifically:

1. **Path 1 (Depth 2)**: This path involves conditional checks and potential creation or modification of `UserState` objects, as well as adding a listener to `mPrintJobStateChangeListenerRecords`. However, the condition `if (1 == 0)` suggests that this path is not actually executable in practice.

2. **Path 2 (Depth 1)**: This path directly interacts with getting or creating a user state and then adds a listener (`UserState$2`) to `mPrintJobStateChangeListenerRecords`. It involves clearing and restoring the calling identity, which is a common pattern when performing operations that should not be attributed to the current caller for security reasons.

3. **Path 3 (Depth 0)**: This path simply returns without any action, suggesting it's either a placeholder or an optimization for certain conditions.

The sink code provided involves getting or creating a user state and adding a specific type of listener to records, which is similar across the paths that actually perform operations.

Given the similar APIs:

- `addPrintServicesChangeListener` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both of these APIs involve adding listeners and interact with user states in a manner similar to `addPrintJobStateChangeListener`. The key aspect here is the interaction with system-level components (like `UserState`) and the addition of listeners that could potentially receive sensitive information or affect system behavior.

Considering the similarities in code patterns, especially the involvement of `UserState` and listener additions which are critical for system functionality and security, it's reasonable to conclude that `addPrintJobStateChangeListener` should have a similar access control level to its counterparts. 

Given this analysis, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination is based on the API's interaction with system components and its potential impact on system security and functionality, aligning with the access control levels of similar APIs that perform analogous operations.
