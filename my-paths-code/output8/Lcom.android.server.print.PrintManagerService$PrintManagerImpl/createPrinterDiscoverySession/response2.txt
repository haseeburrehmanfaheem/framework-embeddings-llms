Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `createPrinterDiscoverySession` API.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to be executed. These APIs are related to printer discovery and management, and they seem to be designed to work together with the `createPrinterDiscoverySession` API.

Upon reviewing the code snippets for the `createPrinterDiscoverySession` API, I notice that it involves creating a new printer discovery session, registering an observer, and clearing custom printer icon cache. These operations do not appear to pose significant security risks or require sensitive permissions.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the `createPrinterDiscoverySession` API should have an access control level of `NONE`, similar to its counterpart APIs.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
