To determine the access control level for the `removePrintServicesChangeListener` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The API has three paths with different depths, but all of them ultimately lead to removing a print services change listener from the user state. This operation involves interacting with system-level components and user states.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code directly removes a print services change listener from a user state, which is a specific action related to managing print services and their listeners.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `setPrintServiceEnabled(Landroid/content/ComponentName;ZI)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API enables or disables a print service for a given component name, indicating that it requires system-level permissions to modify the state of print services.
   - `removePrintJobStateChangeListener(Landroid/print/IPrintJobStateChangeListener;I)V` has an access control level of `NONE`. This API removes a listener for print job state changes, which seems less critical in terms of system security compared to enabling/disabling print services.

Given these points:

- The operation of removing a print services change listener is related to managing system resources (print services and their listeners), but it does not directly imply a significant risk or alteration to the system's security state like enabling/disabling a service might.
- The similarity with `setPrintServiceEnabled` suggests some level of system interaction, but `removePrintServicesChangeListener` seems less impactful on system security compared to modifying service states.
- The comparison with `removePrintJobStateChangeListener`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, indicates that removing listeners (in this case, for print job state changes) might not require elevated permissions.

However, considering the context of managing print services and the fact that it involves system-level components, assigning an access control level requires balancing between security and functionality. Given that `removePrintServicesChangeListener` deals with system resources but doesn't seem to pose a significant risk like modifying service states, it's reasonable to consider it as not requiring the highest level of access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`) but still needing some level of protection or normal access control.

Therefore, considering the balance and the nature of the operation (removing a listener), which is less critical than enabling/disabling services but still involves system resources, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`. This reflects the need for controlled access without elevating it to the level required for more sensitive operations like service state modifications.
