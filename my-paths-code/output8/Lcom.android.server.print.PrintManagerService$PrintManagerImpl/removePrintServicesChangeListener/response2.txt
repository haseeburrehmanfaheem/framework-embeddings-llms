To determine the access control level for the `removePrintServicesChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The most similar APIs in terms of functionality and structure are `addPrintServicesChangeListener`, `setPrintServiceEnabled`, and `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener`. These methods all interact with print services or their recommendations and have a high similarity score.
   - Among these, `addPrintServicesChangeListener` and `addPrintServiceRecommendationsChangeListener` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permission to execute. This suggests that adding listeners for print services changes is considered sensitive.
   - `setPrintServiceEnabled` also has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, further supporting the notion that modifying print service states (enabling/disabling) requires elevated permissions.

2. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, if a setter method (or in this case, an "adder" of a listener) requires a certain level of access control, the corresponding remover or getter should have either the same or lower access control requirements. This is because adding or modifying data typically poses a greater security risk than reading or removing it.
   - However, given that `removePrintJobStateChangeListener` has an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that not all listener removals are considered equally sensitive.

3. **Specific Method Analysis**:
   - The `removePrintServicesChangeListener` method is involved in managing listeners for print service changes. Given its similarity to `addPrintServicesChangeListener`, which requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access, one might initially think it should have a similar or lower access control level.
   - However, considering the principle that removing a listener might be less sensitive than adding one (since it's about stopping the receipt of information rather than initiating it), and looking at the example of `removePrintJobStateChangeListener` having `NONE` access control, we can infer that not all removal operations are equally restricted.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the similarities with other methods that require `SYS_OR_SIG` access for adding listeners or modifying print service states, but also considering the principle that removing a listener is generally less sensitive than adding one, and the specific example of `removePrintJobStateChangeListener` having no restrictions (`NONE`), we can deduce that `removePrintServicesChangeListener` likely requires a moderate level of access control.
   - However, since there's a precedent for removal operations being less restricted (as seen with `removePrintJobStateChangeListener`), and considering the specific interactions with system components, it seems reasonable to align its access control with the more permissive end of the spectrum while still acknowledging some level of sensitivity.

Therefore, based on the analysis and balancing between the sensitivity of managing print services listeners and the precedent set by similar APIs, I would assign an access control level that reflects a need for some protection but recognizes the removal operation as less risky than addition or modification.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This choice is made considering the removal of a listener is generally less sensitive and aligns with the precedent set by `removePrintJobStateChangeListener`. However, it's crucial to note that specific security requirements can depend on detailed contextual factors not fully captured in this analysis.
