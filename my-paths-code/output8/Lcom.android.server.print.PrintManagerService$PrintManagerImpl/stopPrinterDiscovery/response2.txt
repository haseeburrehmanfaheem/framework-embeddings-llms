Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method.

The `stopPrinterDiscovery` method has a similarity score above 0.95 with several other APIs in the same class, including `stopPrinterStateTracking`, `startPrinterDiscovery`, `startPrinterStateTracking`, and `validatePrinters`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Additionally, the sink code entries for these similar APIs involve interactions with the `UserState` and `PrinterDiscoverySession` objects, which are also present in the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method does not require any specific access control level beyond what is already implied by its similarity to other APIs with an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, I would assign the following access control level to the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This assignment is based on the principle that if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction. In this case, since the similar APIs with an access control level of `NONE` are all involved in stopping or starting printer discovery or state tracking, it is likely that the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method does not pose a significant security risk and can be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
