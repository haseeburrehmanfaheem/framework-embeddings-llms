To determine the access control level for the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but the critical parts for determining access control are in paths 1 and 2. Path 3 is a simple return statement without any actual operation, which doesn't contribute to understanding the access control needs.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves getting or creating a user state locked (`PrintManagerService$PrintManagerImpl.getOrCreateUserStateLocked`) and stopping printer discovery locked (`this.mPrinterDiscoverySession.stopPrinterDiscoveryLocked`). These operations suggest interaction with system services and management of printer discovery sessions, which could imply a need for certain permissions or access controls.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `stopPrinterStateTracking`: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and involves stopping the tracking of a printer's state. Its similarity to `stopPrinterDiscovery` suggests that if one requires no special access control, the other might not either, given their similar operations.
   - `startPrinterDiscovery`: Also with an access control level of `NONE`, this method starts a printer discovery session. The symmetry in access control levels between starting and stopping a service often implies consistency in how these operations are secured.

Given these points:

- The operations within `stopPrinterDiscovery` (getting/creating user states, managing printer discovery sessions) do not inherently suggest a need for elevated or dangerous permissions based on the provided similar APIs.
- Both similar APIs (`stopPrinterStateTracking` and `startPrinterDiscovery`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that these types of operations might not require special permissions.

Therefore, considering the consistency with similar APIs and the nature of the operations involved, the most appropriate access control level for the `stopPrinterDiscovery` method would be `NONE`.
