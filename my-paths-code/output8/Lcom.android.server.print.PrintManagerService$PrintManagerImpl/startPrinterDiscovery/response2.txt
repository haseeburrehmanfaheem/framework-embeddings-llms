Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, we can make an informed decision about the access control level for the `startPrinterDiscovery` API.

The `startPrinterDiscovery` API has similarities with other APIs in the same class, such as `stopPrinterDiscovery`, `startPrinterStateTracking`, `stopPrinterStateTracking`, `validatePrinters`, and `createPrinterDiscoverySession`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given that the `startPrinterDiscovery` API interacts with the same sinks (e.g., `UserState` and `mPrinterDiscoverySession`) as these similar APIs, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level.

Furthermore, the semantics of the `startPrinterDiscovery` API suggest that it is not performing any sensitive operations that would require elevated access control. The API appears to be responsible for starting printer discovery, which is a relatively benign operation.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the semantics of the `startPrinterDiscovery` API, I conclude that the access control level for this API should be `NONE`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
