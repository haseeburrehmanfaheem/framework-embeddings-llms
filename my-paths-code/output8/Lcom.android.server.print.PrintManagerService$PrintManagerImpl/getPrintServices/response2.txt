To determine the access control level for the `getPrintServices` method in the `PrintManagerService$PrintManagerImpl` class, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs that interact with the same sinks.

1. **Analysis of getPrintServices Method**:
   - The method returns a list of print services based on certain conditions and parameters (`p1` and `p2`).
   - It involves checking user states, installed services, and their enablement status.
   - The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` to clear the calling identity, which is a common practice when performing operations that should not be attributed to the calling process.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **isPrintServiceEnabled**: This method checks if a print service is enabled for a given user. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any specific permissions or restrictions.
   - **setPrintServiceEnabled**: This method enables or disables a print service for a user and requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that it should be protected with system or signature-level permissions due to its ability to modify system settings.
   - **addPrintServicesChangeListener**, **restartPrintJob**, and **print**: These methods all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting they require significant protection as they can modify system states, restart jobs, or initiate printing operations.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that the `getPrintServices` method is primarily a getter method that returns information about available print services without modifying any system settings, it generally poses less risk compared to setter methods like `setPrintServiceEnabled`.
   - However, considering the similarities with other protected methods (`addPrintServicesChangeListener`, `restartPrintJob`, `print`) and the fact that it deals with system-level services, assigning a higher access control level than `NONE` might be prudent.
   - Since reading data (in this case, getting print services) is less sensitive than writing or modifying data, but still involves system services, an access control level of `NORMAL` seems appropriate. This balances the need for some level of protection with the understanding that merely accessing a list of services does not inherently pose a significant security risk.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's functionality and comparisons with similar APIs, assigning an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getPrintServices` method is reasonable. This reflects its role in providing system information without directly modifying sensitive settings or data.
