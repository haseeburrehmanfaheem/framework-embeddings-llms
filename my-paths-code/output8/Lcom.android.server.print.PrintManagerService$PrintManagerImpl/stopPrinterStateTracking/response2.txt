To determine the access control level for the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code paths for `stopPrinterStateTracking` involve interactions with user states, printer discovery sessions, and checking of various conditions such as whether a user is unlocking or unlocked, and the state of active services. The method seems to be involved in managing the tracking of printer states, which could potentially impact system resources or user data.

Given the similar APIs:
- `startPrinterStateTracking` with an access control level of `NONE`, which also interacts with printer discovery sessions but for starting the tracking.
- `stopPrinterDiscovery` with an access control level of `NONE`, which stops printer discovery and also involves interaction with a printer discovery session.

Both of these similar APIs have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that operations related to managing printer state tracking or discovery are not considered sensitive enough to require higher levels of access control like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering the semantics and functionality of `stopPrinterStateTracking` in relation to these similar APIs, it appears that stopping printer state tracking does not inherently involve sensitive operations that would necessitate elevated permissions. The method's interactions with user states and printer discovery sessions are comparable to those in the similar APIs, which do not have restrictive access control levels.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the comparison with similar APIs, the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.
