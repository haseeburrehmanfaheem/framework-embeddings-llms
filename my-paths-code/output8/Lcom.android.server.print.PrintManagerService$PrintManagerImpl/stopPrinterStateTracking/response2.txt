Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `stopPrinterStateTracking` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them seem to be related to stopping printer state tracking for a given printer ID. The sink code entries suggest that this method interacts with user states, printer discovery sessions, and printer state tracking.

The similar APIs provided have the following characteristics:

* `startPrinterStateTracking`: starts printer state tracking for a given printer ID, with a similarity of 0.9853869080543518.
* `stopPrinterDiscovery`: stops printer discovery for a given observer, with a similarity of 0.9809011220932007.
* `validatePrinters`: validates printers for a given list, with similarities ranging from 0.9513656497001648 to 0.938139796257019.
* `startPrinterDiscovery`: starts printer discovery for a given observer and list, with a similarity of 0.9486712217330933.
* `createPrinterDiscoverySession`: creates a printer discovery session for a given observer, with a similarity of 0.9126855731010437.

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method does not require any specific access control restrictions, as it is likely related to stopping a tracking process that was previously started.

Considering the similarities and the lack of access control restrictions in the similar APIs, I conclude that the `stopPrinterStateTracking` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.
