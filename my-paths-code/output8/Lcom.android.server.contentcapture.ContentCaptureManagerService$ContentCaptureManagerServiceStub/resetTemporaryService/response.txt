Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public void resetTemporaryService(int p1){
    this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);
    return;
}
```

The analysis of potential sinks is as follows:

- The method `resetTemporaryService` takes an input parameter `p1`.
- It invokes another method with the same name (`resetTemporaryService`) on a class instance referenced by `this$0`, passing `p1` as an argument.
- This invocation meets one of the positive rules: it has naming similarity with the API name and takes the input parameters as arguments.

Given this analysis, the identified sink is:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "public void resetTemporaryService(int p1){",
            "this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

However, since `return;` does not contribute to a potential sink according to the provided rules (it's more of an auxiliary operation indicating the end of the method), it is excluded from the list. The invocation of `resetTemporaryService` on `this$0` directly influences the handling of the input parameter `p1`, making these instructions part of the same sink set due to their direct dataflow link.
