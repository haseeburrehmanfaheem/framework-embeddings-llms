To determine the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are both named `setTemporaryService` and have an access control level of `NONE`. 

The key factors to consider when determining the access control level include:
1. **Similarity in Functionality**: The `resetTemporaryService` method seems to be related in functionality to the `setTemporaryService` methods, given their similar names and the fact that they both appear to interact with a temporary service setting.
2. **Code Structure**: Both the `resetTemporaryService` and `setTemporaryService` methods have a simple structure where they call another method of the same name on `this.this$0`, suggesting a delegating or wrapper pattern.
3. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: The similar APIs (`setTemporaryService`) both have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that operations related to setting or resetting temporary services might not require special permissions or pose significant risks.

Given these considerations:
- The method does not seem to interact with sensitive data or perform actions that would typically require elevated permissions (like those classified as `DANGEROUS`).
- It does not appear to be a system-level operation requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access.
- The similarity in functionality and structure with methods classified as `NONE` suggests it might also not need strict access control.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, the most appropriate access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` method would be `NONE`.
