To determine the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` method in the `ContentCaptureManagerService$ContentCaptureManagerServiceStub` class, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `setTemporaryService(ILjava/lang/String;I)V` in `Lcom.android.server.contentcapture.ContentCaptureManagerService$ContentCaptureManagerServiceStub` with an access control level of `NONE`.
2. `setTemporaryComponent(Landroid/content/ComponentName;)V` in `Lcom.android.server.speech.SpeechRecognitionManagerService$SpeechRecognitionManagerServiceStub` with an access control level of `NONE`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to be called. 

However, it's essential to consider the semantics and potential security implications of the `resetTemporaryService` method itself. The method seems to reset a temporary service based on an integer parameter (`p1`). Without more context about what this service does or how critical its resetting might be, we must rely on the similarities and the general principle that if related setter methods (like setting a temporary service) have no restrictions, the corresponding reset functionality might also not require strict access control.

Given these considerations and the fact that both similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`, it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `resetTemporaryService` method. This approach assumes that resetting a temporary service does not pose a significant security risk or violate user privacy, consistent with the treatment of similar methods.

Therefore, based on the information and similarities provided:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision aligns with the principle that if related operations (in this case, setting and resetting temporary services) are not restricted, then `resetTemporaryService` should also be accessible without specific access control, assuming it does not introduce significant security risks or privacy concerns not addressed by the similar APIs.
