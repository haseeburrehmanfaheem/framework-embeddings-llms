Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `unloadNanoAppFromHub` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. The `unloadNanoAppFromHub` method is similar to these APIs in terms of its functionality and sink code entries.

Additionally, the `unloadNanoAppFromHub` method interacts with sensitive data and performs operations that could potentially impact the system's security or stability. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to this method.

Considering the above factors, I conclude that the `unloadNanoAppFromHub` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
