To determine the access control level for the `getContextHubInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `getContextHubInfo` method takes an integer parameter `p1`, which is used to retrieve a value from `mContextHubIdToInfoMap`.
   - If the map contains the key `p1`, it returns the corresponding value; otherwise, it implicitly returns `null` (though the return statement is only explicitly shown for the case when the key exists).

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves converting the input parameter to an `Integer`, checking if this integer is a key in `mContextHubIdToInfoMap`, and then retrieving the associated value from the map.
   - This operation does not seem to involve any sensitive data or operations that could potentially harm the system or leak sensitive information.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs, `getContextHubHandles()`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These methods interact with the same map (`mContextHubIdToInfoMap`) but return handles (keys) instead of info associated with a specific handle.
   - The similarity in functionality and the fact that they operate on the same data structure suggest that the security considerations might be related.

Given these points, we need to consider why `getContextHubHandles()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This could be due to the sensitivity of the information returned or the potential for misuse if accessed improperly. However, `getContextHubInfo` returns more specific information about a context hub based on its ID, which might not be as sensitive as the handles themselves but still requires some level of access control.

Considering the method does not seem to perform any dangerous operations and is related to retrieving information rather than modifying system state or accessing highly sensitive data, it's reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects its need for protection without being overly restrictive.

**Access Control Decision**:
Given the analysis, `getContextHubInfo` seems to require some form of access control but does not appear to deal with highly sensitive operations or data that would necessitate the highest levels of protection (`SYS_OR_SIG`). It's more aligned with operations that should be protected from unauthorized access but are not as critical as those requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions.

Therefore, a reasonable assignment for the access control level of `getContextHubInfo` could be `NORMAL`, reflecting its need for controlled access without indicating it handles extremely sensitive data or operations.
