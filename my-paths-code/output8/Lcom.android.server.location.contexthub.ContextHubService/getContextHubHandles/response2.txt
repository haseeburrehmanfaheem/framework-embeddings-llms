Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getContextHubHandles` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getContextHubHandles` method returns an array of context hub handles, which are identifiers for context hubs. The method accesses the `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` map, which stores context hub information, and returns the keys of this map as an array of integers.

The similar APIs, `getContextHubInfo(I)Landroid/hardware/location/ContextHubInfo;`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` map, but they retrieve a specific context hub info object based on a given ID.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all interact with the same `mContextHubIdToInfoMap` map, it is likely that the `getContextHubHandles` method should have a similar access control level.

However, since the `getContextHubHandles` method only returns a list of handles (IDs) and does not provide direct access to sensitive context hub information, its access control level might be less restrictive than `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the choices, `NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, and `SYS_OR_SIG`, the most appropriate access control level for the `getContextHubHandles` method would be `NORMAL`. This is because the method provides some information about the context hubs, but it does not pose a significant security risk.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
