To determine the access control level for the `getContextHubs` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getContextHubs` method returns a list of context hub information directly (`this.mContextHubInfoList`). This operation does not involve any sensitive user data, complex computations, or interactions with external systems that could pose a security risk.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code ['return this.mContextHubInfoList;'] simply returns the list without any modifications or additional operations, indicating a straightforward and potentially low-risk operation.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `getContextHubHandles()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method seems to return handles (possibly IDs) related to context hubs, which could be considered less sensitive than the actual hub information but still requires a certain level of access control due to its potential to indirectly expose system or application internals.
   - The similarity score between `getContextHubs` and `getContextHubHandles()` is 0.7438616156578064, indicating a significant similarity in their functionality or purpose.

Given these points:

- **Similarity with SYS_OR_SIG API**: Since `getContextHubHandles()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the similarity between the two methods, one might initially think to assign a similar access control level. However, it's crucial to differentiate based on what each method returns and its potential impact.
  
- **Nature of Returned Data**: The actual data returned by `getContextHubs` (a list of context hub information) could be more sensitive or system-internal than just handles or IDs. This sensitivity might necessitate a higher access control level to protect against unauthorized access.

- **Lack of Sensitive Operations**: Despite the potential sensitivity of the data, there's no indication in the provided code that `getContextHubs` performs any operations that would classify it as dangerous (e.g., modifying system settings, accessing sensitive user data without permission).

Considering these factors and given that we have four choices: `NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, the most appropriate access control level for `getContextHubs` seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects the method's potential to return system-internal information without directly engaging in dangerous operations or handling highly sensitive user data.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision balances the need to protect system internals with the understanding that returning a list of context hub information, while potentially sensitive, does not inherently pose a significant risk akin to what `DANGEROUS` or even `SYS_OR_SIG` might imply.
