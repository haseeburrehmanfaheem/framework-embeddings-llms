To determine the access control level for the `getContextHubs` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Method Semantics**: The `getContextHubs` method returns a list of context hub information. This implies it is providing data about the current state or configuration of context hubs available to the system.

2. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The similar API, `getContextHubHandles`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that accessing handles (which can be considered as identifiers or references to specific context hubs) is restricted to system or signature-level permissions. This restriction likely exists because having access to these handles could potentially allow for manipulation or unauthorized access to the context hubs themselves.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code for `getContextHubs` simply returns a list of context hub information (`this.mContextHubInfoList`). There's no apparent modification or sensitive operation being performed directly within this method.
   - For `getContextHubHandles`, the process involves iterating over a set of keys (context hub IDs) and returning an array of these IDs. This operation is read-only and does not modify system state but still requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.

4. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, reading data (as in the case of `getContextHubs`) is considered less sensitive than writing or modifying it. However, if the information returned by `getContextHubs` could be used to infer sensitive details about the device's state or user behavior, it might still require some level of protection.
   - The principle that if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should have an equal or higher access control level, suggests we consider the potential sensitivity and implications of accessing this information.

Given these considerations:

- **getContextHubs** returns information about context hubs without modifying them. This operation seems less sensitive than operations requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions but could still potentially reveal system details.
- The similar API (`getContextHubHandles`) requires `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that even read-only operations related to context hub management are considered sensitive enough to warrant higher access control.

However, since `getContextHubs` does not directly manipulate or expose sensitive data in the same way as handles might (which could be used for further unauthorized actions), and considering the general principle that reading is less risky than writing, it's reasonable to conclude that while some protection is warranted, it may not need to be as restrictive as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, a balanced approach would suggest an access control level that reflects the method's potential to reveal system or configuration details but does not pose an immediate risk of data manipulation or security breach.

**Conclusion**: Given the information and analysis, assigning an access control level of **NORMAL** seems appropriate. This choice acknowledges the need for some protection due to the method's ability to provide system-related information while recognizing that it doesn't directly enable sensitive operations.
