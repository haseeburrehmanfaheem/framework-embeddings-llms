To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided `onReceive` method has the following code:

```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```

And the sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE` and their code snippets are almost identical to the one in question. The similarity scores are 1.0 and 0.9965633153915405, indicating a very high degree of similarity between these methods.

Given this information, we can conclude that the `onReceive` method should have the same access control level as its highly similar counterparts, which is `NONE`. This is because the code patterns are nearly identical, suggesting that they pose a similar risk or requirement for access control.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
