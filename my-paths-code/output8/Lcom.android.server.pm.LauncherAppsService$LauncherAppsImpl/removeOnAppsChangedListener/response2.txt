To determine the access control level for the `removeOnAppsChangedListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with different implementations but shares a common sink code snippet: `boolean v1 = this.mListeners.unregister(p1);`. This line is crucial as it directly interacts with the listener registration mechanism.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **unregisterListener(Landroid/net/INetworkPolicyListener;)V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9814019203186035) and is assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. The key operation in this similar API is also the `unregister` call, which suggests that the primary action (unregistering a listener) is considered normal in terms of access control.
   - **unregisterWeakEscrowTokenRemovedListener(Lcom/android/internal/widget/IWeakEscrowTokenRemovedListener;)Z**: With a similarity score of 0.9500769376754761, this API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although it also involves unregistering a listener, the context and the return type (indicating success or failure) might imply a need for system or signature-level permission due to the nature of escrow token management.

3. **Semantics and Context**: The `removeOnAppsChangedListener` method is involved in managing listeners for app changes, which could be related to system-level events or user-installed apps. Unregistering such a listener might not necessarily require dangerous permissions but does involve system resources and callbacks.

Given these points:

- The primary action (unregistering a listener) is similar across the compared APIs.
- The `NORMAL` access control level of the highly similar `unregisterListener` API suggests that such operations are generally considered safe and not requiring elevated permissions.
- Although one of the similar APIs has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, its context (escrow token management) might imply specific security considerations not directly applicable to app change listeners.

**Conclusion**: Considering the similarity in operation (unregistering a listener) and the assigned access control levels of similar APIs, especially the highly similar one with `NORMAL` access control, it's reasonable to conclude that the `removeOnAppsChangedListener` method should also have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This is because it primarily deals with managing callbacks for system events without directly implying a need for dangerous or signature-level permissions.
