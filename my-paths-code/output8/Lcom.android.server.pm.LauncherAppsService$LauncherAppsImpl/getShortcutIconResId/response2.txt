To determine the access control level for the `getShortcutIconResId` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - The method has three different code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0), but all of them eventually call `this.mShortcutServiceInternal.getShortcutIconResId` after checking if the profile is accessible or if certain conditions are met related to user IDs and permissions.
   - The checks involve `canAccessProfile`, `isProfileAccessible`, and comparisons between user IDs, indicating that access control is enforced based on the caller's identity and the target user/profile.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Two similar APIs (`getShortcutIconUri`) are provided with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with shortcut services and enforce access controls based on user IDs.
   - The similarity in functionality (dealing with shortcuts) and the enforcement of access controls suggest that these APIs handle sensitive data or operations, thus requiring a certain level of permission or signature verification.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that all paths in `getShortcutIconResId` lead to a call that is similar in nature to those found in the `SYS_OR_SIG` rated `getShortcutIconUri` methods, and considering the access control checks (e.g., profile accessibility, user ID comparisons), it's reasonable to conclude that `getShortcutIconResId` should have a similar access control level.
   - The method does not seem to perform operations that would categorize it as `DANGEROUS` (which typically involves direct manipulation of sensitive data or hardware resources without the need for system or signature permissions) nor as `NONE` (which implies no access control). It also doesn't fit perfectly into `NORMAL`, as the checks and the similarity with `SYS_OR_SIG` rated methods suggest a need for more than basic protection.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of code paths, similar APIs, and the nature of access controls enforced within the method, the most appropriate access control level for `getShortcutIconResId` is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects the method's interaction with sensitive user data (shortcuts) and its reliance on system-level checks to ensure that access is properly controlled.
