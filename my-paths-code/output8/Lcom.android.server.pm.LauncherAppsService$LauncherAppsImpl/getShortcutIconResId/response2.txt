Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getShortcutIconResId` method.

The `getShortcutIconResId` method is used to retrieve the icon resource ID of a shortcut. The method has three paths with different depths, and all of them involve checking the caller's permission to access the profile before returning the icon resource ID.

The similar APIs provided have the following access control levels:

* `getShortcutIconUri`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `getShortcutIconFd`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `hasShortcutHostPermission`: NONE
* `registerShortcutChangeCallback`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `getIconMaxDimensions`: SYS_OR_SIG

Most of the similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which indicates that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. The only exception is `hasShortcutHostPermission`, which has an access control level of NONE.

However, considering the semantics of the `getShortcutIconResId` method and its interaction with the `mShortcutServiceInternal` object, it is likely that this method requires a system or signature-level permission to access. This is because the method is retrieving sensitive information (icon resource ID) related to shortcuts, which may be restricted to certain users or applications.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the semantics of the `getShortcutIconResId` method, I assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to this method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
