To determine the access control level for the `getStartedJobs` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `getPendingJob(I)Landroid/app/job/JobInfo;` has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `getAllPendingJobs()Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` also has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `cancelAll()V` has a more restrictive access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to its ability to cancel jobs which could impact system functionality.
   - `getAllJobSnapshots()Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that accessing job snapshots is considered sensitive and requires higher privileges.

2. **Semantics of the APIs**:
   - The `getStartedJobs` method returns a list of jobs that are currently running. This operation is essentially a read operation, as it does not modify any data but rather retrieves existing information about the state of jobs.
   
3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Generally, reading data (as in the case of `getStartedJobs`) is considered less sensitive than writing or modifying data. However, the sensitivity also depends on what kind of data is being accessed and how it could be used.
   - The fact that similar methods like `getPendingJob` and `getAllPendingJobs` have an access control level of `NONE` suggests that reading job information is not considered highly sensitive in this context.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the above points, especially considering that `getStartedJobs` is a read operation and similar APIs for reading job information have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `getStartedJobs` should also have a relatively low restriction level. The method does not seem to pose significant security risks by itself since it only retrieves information about running jobs without modifying system state.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getStartedJobs` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision aligns with the principle that read operations are generally less risky than write operations and reflects the access control levels of similar APIs within the same class.
