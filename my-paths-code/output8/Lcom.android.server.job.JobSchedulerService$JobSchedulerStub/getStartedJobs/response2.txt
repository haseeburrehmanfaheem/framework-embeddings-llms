To determine the access control level for the `getStartedJobs` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getStartedJobs` method appears to be retrieving a list of started jobs from an `ArraySet` called `mRunningJobs`. The method iterates over the set, adds job information to an `ArrayList`, and returns this list. 

Looking at the two paths provided for the API:
1. Path 1 seems to involve accessing a member variable `this.mRunningJobs` directly.
2. Path 2 involves accessing a static or class-level variable `JobSchedulerService.mConcurrencyManager.getRunningJobsLocked()`.

Both paths suggest that the method is accessing internal job management data, which could be considered sensitive in terms of system operation and security. However, the actual sensitivity depends on what "started jobs" represent and how this information could be used.

The sink code provided focuses on retrieving running jobs from `JobSchedulerService.mConcurrencyManager.getRunningJobsLocked()`, iterating over them, and returning their job information. This suggests that the method is primarily concerned with exposing job scheduling information.

Comparing this to the similar APIs:
- `getPendingJob(I)Landroid/app/job/JobInfo;` has an access control level of `NONE`. It retrieves pending jobs by UID, which might be considered less sensitive than started jobs since it doesn't directly expose active system operations.
- `getAllPendingJobs()Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` also has an access control level of `NONE`. This method returns all pending jobs, which could be a significant amount of data but still pertains to jobs that are not currently executing.

Given the similarity in functionality and considering that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that exposing job information (whether started or pending) is not considered highly sensitive. However, the actual decision should also consider the context in which this method is used and the potential implications of exposing started jobs' information.

Since the method does interact with system-level data but similar APIs dealing with job information have been classified as `NONE`, and without explicit indications that started jobs' information poses a significant risk (e.g., revealing sensitive user data, compromising system security), it's reasonable to align the access control level of `getStartedJobs` with that of its similar APIs.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision assumes that exposing started jobs does not significantly compromise system security or user privacy, consistent with the treatment of pending jobs in the similar APIs.
