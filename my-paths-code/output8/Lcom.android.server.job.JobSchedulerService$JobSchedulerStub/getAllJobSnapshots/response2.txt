Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `getAllJobSnapshots` method.

The similar APIs are:

1. `getAllPendingJobs()` with an access control level of `NONE`
2. `getStartedJobs()` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
3. `getPendingJob(I)` with an access control level of `NONE`
4. `getAllRootTaskInfos()` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`

The `getAllJobSnapshots` method is similar to these APIs in that it retrieves a list of job snapshots, which is a sensitive operation. However, the access control level of `NONE` for `getAllPendingJobs()` and `getPendingJob(I)` suggests that retrieving pending jobs or a specific pending job does not require significant access control.

On the other hand, the access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` for `getStartedJobs()` and `getAllRootTaskInfos()` indicates that retrieving started jobs or root task infos requires higher access control, likely due to the sensitive nature of this information.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `getAllJobSnapshots` method, I would argue that retrieving all job snapshots is a sensitive operation that requires some level of access control. However, since it is similar to `getAllPendingJobs()` and `getPendingJob(I)` which have an access control level of `NONE`, I would not assign the highest access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getAllJobSnapshots` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
