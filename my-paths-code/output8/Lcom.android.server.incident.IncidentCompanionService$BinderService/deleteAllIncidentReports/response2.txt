To determine the access control level for the `deleteAllIncidentReports` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: All three paths of the `deleteAllIncidentReports` method involve clearing the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` before calling `IIncidentManager`'s `deleteAllIncidentReports(p1)`, and then restoring it with `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`. This pattern suggests that the method is interacting with a system service (`IIncidentManager`) in a way that requires temporarily changing or hiding the caller's identity, which is a common approach when performing operations that should not be attributed to the calling application for security or privacy reasons.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided also follow the same pattern of clearing and restoring the calling identity before interacting with `IIncidentManager`. This further emphasizes the method's interaction with system-level services in a secured manner.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs (`deleteIncidentReports`) are provided, both with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with `IIncidentManager` but for deleting incident reports based on additional parameters (strings). The similarity in access control levels between these methods and the pattern of clearing/restoring calling identities suggests that operations related to incident management have specific security considerations.
   - The high similarity scores (0.9817627668380737 and 0.9773914813995361) indicate that `deleteAllIncidentReports` shares significant functionality or operational context with these `deleteIncidentReports` methods, likely implying similar security requirements.

Given this analysis:

- **Interaction with System Services**: The method interacts with system services (`IIncidentManager`) in a manner that requires securing the caller's identity.
- **Similarity with Other APIs**: High similarity scores with other methods that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating similar security and operational contexts.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's interaction with system-level services, the need to secure or alter the calling identity temporarily, and the high similarity with other methods classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `deleteAllIncidentReports` method should also be classified under a similar access control level to ensure consistency in security handling for incident management operations.

The final access control level for the API is:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
