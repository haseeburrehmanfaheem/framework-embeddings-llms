To determine the access control level for the `deleteAllIncidentReports` method, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The provided API has high similarity scores (above 0.97) with `deleteIncidentReports`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the operations performed by these two methods are closely related in terms of security requirements.

2. **Security Implications**: Both `deleteAllIncidentReports` and `deleteIncidentReports` interact with incident reports, which likely contain sensitive information about system or application incidents. Deleting such reports could potentially be used to cover up malicious activities or errors, implying a need for restricted access.

3. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**:
   - `deleteIncidentReports`: `SYS_OR_SIG`
   - `getIncidentReport` and `getIncidentReportList`: Both are `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that even reading incident reports requires high-level access, suggesting that the data is sensitive.
   - `clearPassword`: Also `SYS_OR_SIG`, which is expected due to its direct impact on user account security.

4. **Comparison with Less Similar APIs**:
   - `createSession` has a much lower similarity score and an access control level of `NONE`. This method, however, deals with a different domain (TV input services) and does not handle sensitive data in the same way incident reports do.

Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that `deleteAllIncidentReports`, like its highly similar counterpart `deleteIncidentReports` and other methods dealing with sensitive incident report data, should have a high access control level to prevent unauthorized deletion of potentially critical system or application incident data.

**Access Control Decision**: Since the method involves deleting all incident reports, which could be a security-sensitive operation (potentially allowing a malicious actor to hide evidence of wrongdoing), it should require a significant level of permission. The similarity in functionality and security implications with other `SYS_OR_SIG` methods supports assigning it the same access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
