Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `getIncidentReportList` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getIncidentReport`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It is similar to `getIncidentReportList` in terms of its functionality, as both methods interact with the incident manager service.
2. `deleteIncidentReports` and `deleteAllIncidentReports`: Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although they are not directly related to `getIncidentReportList` in terms of their functionality (they are used for deletion instead of retrieval), they do interact with the same incident manager service.

Considering the similarities and the fact that all the provided similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getIncidentReportList` method should also have a similar access control level. This is because the incident manager service is likely to require system or signature-level permissions to access and manage incident reports.

Additionally, since `getIncidentReportList` is a getter method, its access control level might be less restrictive than that of the corresponding setter methods (e.g., `deleteIncidentReports` and `deleteAllIncidentReports`). However, given the similarities with the other APIs and the fact that they all interact with the same sensitive service, it's likely that `getIncidentReportList` should still have a relatively high access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getIncidentReportList` method.

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
