To determine the access control level for the `denyReport` API, let's analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of the `denyReport` method involve parsing a URI from the input string `p1`, extracting an "id" parameter, and then performing actions based on this id, such as removing a pending report record and sending broadcasts.
   - The critical operations include `PendingReports.sendBroadcast()` (or its overloaded version with additional parameters) and `PendingReports$PendingReportRec.listener.onReportDenied()`. These suggest interactions with system-level components or other apps, which could imply a need for certain permissions.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `approveReport(Ljava/lang/String;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute.
   - This API also involves finding and removing pending report records and sending broadcasts, which are similar operations to those found in the `denyReport` method.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given the similarities between `denyReport` and `approveReport`, including their interactions with system components (e.g., sending broadcasts) and the need to manage pending reports securely, it's reasonable to infer that `denyReport` should have a similar access control level.
   - The operations within `denyReport`, such as removing records and notifying listeners, do not appear to pose an immediate risk that would necessitate a `DANGEROUS` permission (which typically involves direct access to sensitive user data or device capabilities).
   - Therefore, considering the system-level interactions and the need for security in managing reports, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems appropriate. This ensures that only authorized components (either system-level or those signed with the same certificate as the component defining this API) can invoke this method.

**Final Access Control Level**:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's functionality, its similarity to other APIs with known access control levels, and the principle of least privilege, ensuring that system interactions are secured appropriately without over-restricting legitimate usage.
