To determine the access control level for the `denyReport` method in the `IncidentCompanionService$BinderService` class, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `denyReport` method appears to be part of a service that handles incident reports. It takes a string parameter `p1`, which seems to contain an ID for a pending report. The method's primary actions include:

1. Parsing the input string to extract the report ID.
2. Removing the corresponding report from a list of pending reports if found.
3. Sending a broadcast related to the denial of the report.
4. Notifying a listener about the report denial.

Given these operations, we can see that this method modifies data (by removing a pending report) and performs actions that could have security implications (such as sending broadcasts and notifying listeners).

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

- `approveReport(String)` in `IncidentCompanionService$BinderService` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method is similar in nature to `denyReport`, as it also deals with modifying the state of a report (approving instead of denying) and performs related actions like sending broadcasts. The high similarity score (up to 0.9557846784591675) suggests that these methods are closely related in functionality.
- `authorizeReport(int, String, String, String, int, IIncidentAuthListener)` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although its parameters and specific actions differ, it's involved in the authorization process of reports, which is a security-sensitive operation.

Considering these points:

- The `denyReport` method modifies data and performs security-relevant actions.
- Similar methods (`approveReport` and `authorizeReport`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require significant protection due to their impact on system security and privacy.

Given the information provided and following the principle that writing data (in this case, denying a report) usually poses a greater security risk than reading it, and considering the similarities with other methods that are protected at the `SYS_OR_SIG` level, it's reasonable to conclude that the `denyReport` method should also be assigned a high level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `denyReport` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the method's potential impact on system security and privacy, aligning with the protection levels of similar APIs within the same service.
