To determine the access control level for the `deleteIncidentReports` method, we need to analyze the provided information, including the code snippets of the method and its similar APIs, along with their assigned access control levels.

1. **Analysis of deleteIncidentReports Method**:
   - The method involves clearing the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` before performing operations related to incident reports.
   - It interacts with an `IIncidentManager` service, which suggests it deals with managing incidents, potentially involving sensitive data or system-level operations.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **deleteAllIncidentReports**: This method has a high similarity (above 0.97) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The high similarity in code structure and the involvement of incident management suggest that `deleteIncidentReports` might require a similar level of access control.
   - **getIncidentReport** and **getIncidentReportList**: Both have similarities above 0.88 and are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels. Although they are getter methods, which generally require less restrictive access control than setter or deletion methods, their involvement in incident report management and the need to protect potentially sensitive information justify a higher access control level.
   - **clearPassword**: With a lower similarity (0.70) but still assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method's inclusion suggests that operations affecting user or system security are treated with high scrutiny regarding access control.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the similarities in code patterns, especially with `deleteAllIncidentReports`, and considering the nature of incident report management which likely involves sensitive data or system-level operations, it's reasonable to conclude that `deleteIncidentReports` should have a stringent access control level.
   - The fact that all similar APIs analyzed have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` as their access control level further supports this conclusion. This level indicates that the method can only be accessed by system or signature-protected components, ensuring that sensitive operations are securely managed.

Based on the analysis of the code snippets and the similarities with other APIs, along with their assigned access control levels, it's clear that `deleteIncidentReports` should have a high level of access control to protect sensitive data and ensure system security.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination aligns with the principle that operations which can modify or delete sensitive data, such as incident reports, should be restricted to system-level components or those protected by signature verification to prevent unauthorized access.
