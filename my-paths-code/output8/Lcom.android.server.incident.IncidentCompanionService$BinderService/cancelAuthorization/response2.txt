Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `cancelAuthorization` method.

The similar APIs with high similarity scores (above 0.7) are:

1. `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps([Ljava/lang/String;I)V` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `getTasks(IZZI)Ljava/util/List;` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
4. `authorizeReport(ILjava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;ILandroid/os/IIncidentAuthListener;)V` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. This is likely due to the sensitive nature of the operations being performed, such as granting permissions or accessing task information.

In contrast, the `getInputMethodWindowVisibleHeight(Lcom/android/internal/view/IInputMethodClient;)I` method has an access control level of NONE, but its similarity score is relatively low (0.7291520237922668).

Considering the similarities between the `cancelAuthorization` method and the other APIs, I believe that it should have a similar access control level. The method appears to be related to incident reporting and authorization, which may involve sensitive information and require system-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `cancelAuthorization` method should have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
