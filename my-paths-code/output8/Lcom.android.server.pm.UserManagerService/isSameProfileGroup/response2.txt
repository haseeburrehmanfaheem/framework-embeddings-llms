To determine the access control level for the `isSameProfileGroup` method in the `UserManagerService` class, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `getSeedAccountOptions`: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `canHaveRestrictedProfile`: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `getUserSerialNumber`: NONE
4. `isUserNameSet`: SYS_OR_SIG
5. `getSeedAccountName`: SYS_OR_SIG

These APIs have similarities in terms of accessing user information through `this.mUsers.get(p1)` and checking removing user IDs via `this.mRemovingUserIds.get(p1)`. The majority of these similar APIs (4 out of 5) are assigned the access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access or modify sensitive user data.

The `isSameProfileGroup` method, as shown in its code paths, also accesses user information and checks for removing user IDs, similar to the other APIs. This suggests that it handles sensitive user data and thus should be protected at a level consistent with these similar APIs.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `isSameProfileGroup` method is `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the protection levels of the majority of its similar APIs and reflects the sensitivity of the data it accesses.
