To determine the access control level for the `isUserRunning` method in the `UserManagerService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `isUserRunning` method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately lead to checking if a user is running or not. The sink code entries for this method are related to getting the state of a user from a map (`v4.get(p1, -1)`) and calling another method on `mLocalService` to check if the user is running.

The similar APIs provided have varying access control levels:

- `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked` and `isUserUnlocked` in `UserManagerService` both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are related to checking the unlock state of a user, which could be considered sensitive information.
- `getProperty` in `BatteryService$BatteryPropertiesRegistrar` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that getting battery properties is not restricted.
- `logEvent` in `IpConnectivityMetrics$Impl` has an access control level of `NORMAL`, suggesting some level of restriction but not as high as system or signature level.
- `createPartition` in `DynamicSystemService` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that creating a partition is not restricted.

Given the similarities between `isUserRunning` and other methods like `isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked` and `isUserUnlocked`, which are all related to user states and have a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`), it's reasonable to infer that `isUserRunning` should also have a similar or at least not lower access control level. This is because checking if a user is running could potentially reveal sensitive information about the system's current state.

However, considering the principle that reading data (like checking if a user is running) is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and without explicit indications that this method poses a significant security risk, we might not necessarily assign the highest level of restriction. But given the context and similarities with other methods in `UserManagerService`, assigning a level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems appropriate to maintain consistency with how user state information is protected.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the nature of the method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects the need to protect sensitive user state information consistently within the `UserManagerService` class.
