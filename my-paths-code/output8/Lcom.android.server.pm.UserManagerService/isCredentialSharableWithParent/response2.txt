Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `isCredentialSharableWithParent` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `hasBadge(I)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
2. `isUserOfType(ILjava/lang/String;)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
3. `getUserBadgeResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
4. `getUserIconBadgeResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
5. `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

The `isCredentialSharableWithParent` method appears to be related to user management and credential sharing, which is a sensitive operation. Given the similarities with the other APIs, it is likely that this method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `isCredentialSharableWithParent` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
