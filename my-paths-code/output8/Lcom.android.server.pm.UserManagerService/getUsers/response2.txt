To determine the access control level for the `getUsers` method in the `UserManagerService` class, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are:

1. `findCurrentGuestUser()`: Access Control Level - `SYS_OR_SIG`
2. `getPrimaryUser()`: Access Control Level - `SYS_OR_SIG`
3. `getRemainingCreatableUserCount(String)`: Access Control Level - `SYS_OR_SIG`
4. `someUserHasSeedAccount(String, String)`: Access Control Level - `SYS_OR_SIG`
5. `createProfileForUserWithThrow(String, String, int, int, String[])`: Access Control Level - `SYS_OR_SIG`

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access or modify user data.

Given the similarities in code structure and the fact that `getUsers` also deals with sensitive user information, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a similar access control level. The method interacts with user data, which is a sensitive operation, suggesting that it should not be freely accessible to all applications.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the principle that reading data (in this case, retrieving a list of users) is generally less sensitive than writing data but still requires protection due to the nature of the data being accessed, the access control level for `getUsers` should be aligned with the levels of its similar APIs.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
