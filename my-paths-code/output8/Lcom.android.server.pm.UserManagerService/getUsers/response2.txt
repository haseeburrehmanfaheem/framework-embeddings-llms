To determine the access control level for the `getUsers` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The `getUsers` method appears to be interacting with user data, specifically retrieving a list of users based on certain conditions.

The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them involve accessing user information from `this.mUsers`, which seems to be a collection of user data. The first two paths involve more complex logic and conditional checks before adding user information to the result list, while the third path simply calls an internal method `getUsersInternal` to retrieve the list.

The similar APIs provided, `findCurrentGuestUser()` and `getPrimaryUser()`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with user data but seem to be focused on finding specific types of users (guest or primary) rather than retrieving a general list of users. However, their logic involves checking the size of the user collection, accessing specific user objects, and checking removal status, which are similar operations to those found in the `getUsers` method.

Given these observations:

- The `getUsers` method handles sensitive user data.
- It performs operations similar to those in `findCurrentGuestUser()` and `getPrimaryUser()`, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- Accessing and manipulating user data typically requires a certain level of system or signature permission to ensure privacy and security.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of the data being handled and the similarities with other APIs that require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getUsers` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
