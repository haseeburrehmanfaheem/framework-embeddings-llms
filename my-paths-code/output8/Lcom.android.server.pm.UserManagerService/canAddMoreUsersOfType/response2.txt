Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will analyze the `canAddMoreUsersOfType` method to determine its access control level.

The `canAddMoreUsersOfType` method is used to check if more users of a specific type can be added. It interacts with the `mUserTypes` map and retrieves information about the user type, such as whether it's enabled, the maximum allowed number of users, and the current number of users.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to user management, such as getting the remaining creatable user count, checking if a user type is enabled, and creating a new user.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `canAddMoreUsersOfType` method, it's likely that this method also requires system or signature-level permission to access. This is because it provides sensitive information about user management and could potentially be used to bypass security restrictions if not properly restricted.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `canAddMoreUsersOfType` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
