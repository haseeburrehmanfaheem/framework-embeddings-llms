Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` method.

The method `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` is used to retrieve the dark color resource ID for a user's badge. The similar APIs provided, such as `getUserBadgeColorResId`, `getUserBadgeLabelResId`, `getUserIconBadgeResId`, `getUserBadgeResId`, and `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also used to retrieve various resources related to user badges.

The sink code entries for these similar APIs show that they interact with the same sinks, such as `UserInfo` and `UserTypeDetails`, and perform similar operations, such as retrieving badge colors or labels. The similarities in code and functionality suggest that the access control level for `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` should be consistent with these similar APIs.

Given that the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the semantics of the `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` method, I conclude that this method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because retrieving a user's badge dark color resource ID may require system or signature-level permissions to ensure that only authorized components can access this information.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
