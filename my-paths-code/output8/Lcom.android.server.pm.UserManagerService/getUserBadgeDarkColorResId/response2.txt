To determine the access control level for the `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with different logic flows but ultimately aims to retrieve a user's badge dark color resource ID based on certain conditions and user information.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with `UserInfo` and `UserTypeDetails` objects, specifically accessing methods like `getDarkThemeBadgeColor` and `getBadgeColor`. These interactions are crucial for determining the access control level as they involve sensitive user data.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getUserBadgeColorResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9771738052368164 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code logic is similar, involving `UserInfo` and `UserTypeDetails` to get the badge color.
   - `getUserBadgeLabelResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9602962136268616 and also an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It follows a similar pattern, using user information to retrieve the badge label.

Given these points:

- The method interacts with sensitive user data through `UserInfo` and `UserTypeDetails`.
- The logic involves conditional checks and retrieval of specific user-related resources (in this case, the dark color resource ID for a badge), which is similar to other methods that have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
- The similarity scores with other APIs (`getUserBadgeColorResId` and `getUserBadgeLabelResId`) are high, indicating that these methods share significant logic and purpose, including the handling of user data.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId` method should have a similar access control level due to its interaction with sensitive user information and its functional similarity to other methods classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
