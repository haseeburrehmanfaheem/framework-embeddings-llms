Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `hasBadge` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getUserBadgeResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
2. `getUserIconBadgeResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
3. `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
4. `isCredentialSharableWithParent(I)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
5. `getUserBadgeLabelResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

The `hasBadge` method is similar to these APIs in terms of its functionality and sink code entries. It also interacts with the same sinks, such as `UserTypeDetails` and `UserInfo`.

Given this information, I conclude that the `hasBadge` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is similar to other APIs that require system or signature-level permission to access.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
