Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `getUserIconBadgeResId` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getUserBadgeResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
2. `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
3. `hasBadge(I)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
4. `getUserBadgeColorResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
5. `getUserBadgeLabelResId(I)I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the user's badge information.

The `getUserIconBadgeResId` method is similar to these APIs, as it also retrieves information related to the user's badge. Therefore, it is likely that this method requires a similar level of access control.

Considering the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `getUserIconBadgeResId` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
