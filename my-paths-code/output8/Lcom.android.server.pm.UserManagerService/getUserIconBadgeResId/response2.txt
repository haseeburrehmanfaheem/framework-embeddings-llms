To determine the access control level for the `getUserIconBadgeResId` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately lead to retrieving an icon badge resource ID based on user type details or directly from a `UserTypeDetails` object.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `UserTypeDetails` and `UserInfo`, focusing on getting the badge or icon badge resource IDs. This indicates that the method is accessing user-specific data, potentially sensitive in nature.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getUserBadgeResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9873342514038086 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves getting user info, checking for badges, and returning the badge plain resource ID.
   - `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9793401956558228 and also an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It follows a similar pattern but returns the badge no background resource ID.

Given these points, we can observe that:
- The method interacts with sensitive user data (user types, badges).
- Similar APIs (`getUserBadgeResId` and `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId`) that also deal with user badges have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to protect potentially sensitive operations.

Considering the similarities in functionality and the handling of user-specific data, it's reasonable to conclude that `getUserIconBadgeResId` should have a comparable access control level to ensure consistency in protecting user data and maintaining system integrity.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `getUserIconBadgeResId` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment aligns with the protection of sensitive user data and maintains consistency with similar APIs that handle user badges.
