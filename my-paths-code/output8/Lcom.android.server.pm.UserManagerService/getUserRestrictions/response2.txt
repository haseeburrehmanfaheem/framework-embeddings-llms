Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getUserRestrictions` method.

The `getUserRestrictions` method is used to retrieve user restrictions, which is a sensitive operation as it involves accessing and returning potentially sensitive data. 

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

- `hasUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z`, `setUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;ZI)V`, `getUserRestrictionSources(Ljava/lang/String;I)Ljava/util/List;`, `markGuestForDeletion(I)Z`, and `hasBaseUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

This suggests that operations related to user restrictions are considered sensitive and require a higher level of access control.

Given the semantics of the `getUserRestrictions` method, which is to retrieve user restrictions, it's reasonable to conclude that this operation should also be protected with a similar or higher access control level as the corresponding setter methods (e.g., `setUserRestriction`) and other related APIs.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getUserRestrictions` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
