To determine the access control level for the `addUserRestrictionsListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) that all involve adding a listener (`IUserRestrictionsListener`) to a list of user restrictions listeners. This action does not directly imply a dangerous operation like accessing sensitive data or performing a critical system function without proper checks.

2. **Similar APIs**: The provided similar APIs are `grantDefaultPermissionsToCarrierServiceApp` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs involve granting permissions, which is a more sensitive operation compared to adding a listener for user restrictions updates. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests these operations require system or signature-level permission, indicating they are critical and potentially dangerous if misused.

3. **Semantics and Sinks**: The sink code provided shows the creation of a synthetic lambda function (`UserManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda1`) and its addition to a list of listeners. This operation does not directly access sensitive data or perform system-critical functions without proper authorization checks, unlike what is implied by the similar APIs' need for `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.

Given these points:

- **Adding a listener** is generally less critical than granting permissions or accessing sensitive information directly.
- The **similar APIs** provided are more sensitive and require higher access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`), but they involve different operations (granting permissions) compared to adding a listener.
- There's no indication that `addUserRestrictionsListener` directly accesses sensitive data or performs dangerous operations without proper authorization.

Considering the above analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `addUserRestrictionsListener` method would be **NORMAL**. This is because adding a listener, while it should be controlled and validated to prevent misuse (e.g., adding malicious listeners), does not inherently require the high-level system or signature permissions that operations like granting default permissions do.
