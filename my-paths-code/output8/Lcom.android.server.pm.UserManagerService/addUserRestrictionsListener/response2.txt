Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `addUserRestrictionsListener` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs are related to permission management and user restrictions, which implies that they handle sensitive operations.

The `addUserRestrictionsListener` method is also related to user restrictions, as it adds a listener for user restriction changes. This operation may potentially expose sensitive information about the user's restrictions or allow an attacker to manipulate these restrictions.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the potential security implications, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `addUserRestrictionsListener` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that only system or signature-level privileged entities can add listeners for user restriction changes, preventing potential security risks.
