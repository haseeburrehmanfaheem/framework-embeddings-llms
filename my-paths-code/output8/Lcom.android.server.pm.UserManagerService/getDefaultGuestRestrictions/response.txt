Based on the provided code snippet, here's the analysis:

The `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` method returns a `Bundle` object that is created using the `mGuestRestrictions` field. 

Here are the potential sinks in JSON format:
```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Bundle v2 = new Bundle(this.mGuestRestrictions);",
      "return v2;"
    ]
  ]
}
```
In this case, there is only one set of instructions that together form a potential sink. The creation of the `Bundle` object and its return value are directly linked, as the output of the `new Bundle` instruction influences the input to the `return` statement.

The `mGuestRestrictions` field access has naming similarity with the API name `getDefaultGuestRestrictions`, which follows one of the positive rules. Additionally, the created `Bundle` object is returned by the API, further supporting its classification as a sink. 

Note that there are no other instructions in this method that could be considered sinks based on the provided rules.
