To determine the access control level for the `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` method creates a new `Bundle` object (`v2`) by copying the contents of `this.mGuestRestrictions`. It then returns this new bundle. This operation does not seem to involve any sensitive data manipulation or system-level modifications that would typically require higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `getUserRestrictionSources` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves getting restriction sources for a specific user and adding an enforcing user, which suggests it deals with system-level user management.
   - The `getUserRestrictions` API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves effective user restrictions based on a given user ID and returns them as a bundle. This operation involves accessing and potentially modifying user restriction settings, which is a system-level functionality.

3. **Comparison**: Both similar APIs have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their involvement in system-level operations such as user management and restriction settings. However, the `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` method seems less intrusive as it simply returns a copy of the default guest restrictions without any indication of modifying system settings or accessing sensitive information.

Given these observations:

- The operation performed by `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` does not appear to modify system settings or access sensitive data directly.
- It does not seem to pose significant risks that would necessitate a `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level based on the provided code snippet and comparison with other APIs.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality is more aligned with retrieving information rather than performing system-level modifications or accessing sensitive data, the most appropriate access control level for `getDefaultGuestRestrictions` would be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects its operation as less critical compared to the similar APIs provided but still recognizes it as an API that should have some form of access control.

{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
