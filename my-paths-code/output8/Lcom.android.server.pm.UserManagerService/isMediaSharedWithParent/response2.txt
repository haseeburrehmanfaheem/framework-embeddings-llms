Based on the provided information and the similar APIs, I will analyze the access control level for the `isMediaSharedWithParent` method.

The method is part of the `UserManagerService` class and interacts with user types and their details. The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access or modify sensitive user data.

The `isMediaSharedWithParent` method seems to be checking whether media is shared with a parent user, which could be considered sensitive information. The method's implementation involves getting user type details and checking specific flags, which is similar to the implementation of the other APIs provided.

Given the similarities in implementation and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `isMediaSharedWithParent` method. This is because the method is accessing sensitive user data and requires system or signature-level permission to ensure that only authorized components can access or modify this information.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
