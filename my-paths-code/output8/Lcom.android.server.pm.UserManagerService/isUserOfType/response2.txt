To determine the access control level for the `isUserOfType` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `isUserOfType` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path involves checking if a user is of a certain type by retrieving the user's information from `this.mUsers` and comparing it with `UserInfo.partial`. If the user is not found, it checks if the user is being removed and then compares the user type with `UserInfo.userType`.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path directly retrieves the user's information using `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` and compares the user type with `UserInfo.userType`.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path uses `p0.getUserTypeNoChecks(p1)` to get the user type and compares it with the input `p2`.

The sink code for this method involves retrieving user information using `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` or `p0.getUserTypeNoChecks(p1)` and comparing the user type with the input.

Comparing these paths with the similar APIs:

* `getProfileType(I)Ljava/lang/String;` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and retrieves user information using `p0.getUserInfoLU(p1)`.
* `isCredentialSharableWithParent(I)Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and uses `UserManagerService.getUserInfoLU(p1)` to retrieve user information.

Both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access user information. The `isUserOfType` method's code paths also involve retrieving user information using similar methods, which suggests that it should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code paths and comparison with similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `isUserOfType` method is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level privileged components can access user information using this method.
