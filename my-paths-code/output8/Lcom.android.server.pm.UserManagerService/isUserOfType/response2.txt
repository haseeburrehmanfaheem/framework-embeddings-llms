Based on the provided information, we can see that the `isUserOfType` method is similar to other APIs in the `UserManagerService` class, such as `getProfileType`, `isCredentialSharableWithParent`, `getUserName`, `getUserCreationTime`, and `hasBadge`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The `isUserOfType` method appears to be checking if a user is of a certain type, which is a sensitive operation that requires system or signature-level permission. The method interacts with the `UserInfo` class and uses methods like `getUserInfoLU` and `getUserTypeNoChecks`, which are also used by the similar APIs.

Given the similarities between the `isUserOfType` method and the other APIs in the `UserManagerService` class, it is likely that the `isUserOfType` method requires a similar level of access control. Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `isUserOfType` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
