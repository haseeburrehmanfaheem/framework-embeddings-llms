Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` method.

The method is used to retrieve application restrictions for a specific user, which involves accessing sensitive data. The similar APIs provided, such as `getApplicationRestrictions`, `getUserRestrictionSources`, `getUserRestrictions`, `hasUserRestriction`, and `setUserRestriction`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that accessing or modifying user restrictions requires system or signature-level permission.

The `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` method has a similar functionality to these APIs, as it retrieves application restrictions for a specific user. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to this method.

Additionally, the method's implementation involves checking if the caller is a system or root user using `UserManagerService.checkSystemOrRoot(v9)`, which further supports the assignment of a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the method's functionality, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getApplicationRestrictionsForUser` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
