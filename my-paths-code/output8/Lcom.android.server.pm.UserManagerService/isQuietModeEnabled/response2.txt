To determine the access control level for the `isQuietModeEnabled` method, we should consider the similarities and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the `isQuietModeEnabled` method itself.

1. **Similarity and Access Control of Similar APIs**:
   - All the similar APIs (`isRestricted`, `requestQuietModeEnabled`, `isDemoUser`, `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId`, `getUserBadgeResId`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to user management, including checking or modifying user states (like quiet mode), are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permission.

2. **Semantics of `isQuietModeEnabled`**:
   - The method checks if quiet mode is enabled for a given user ID. Quiet mode can be associated with managed profiles or other restricted user environments, which implies that accessing or modifying this state could have security implications.
   - Given the context, reading the quiet mode status (a getter operation) might seem less sensitive than setting it (a setter operation). However, knowing whether a user is in quiet mode could still provide valuable information about the device's current state and user configurations.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Since all similar APIs are protected at the `SYS_OR_SIG` level, it suggests that any interaction with user management data, including both reading and writing operations, should be restricted to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.
   - The principle that getter methods do not necessarily require the same level of protection as setter methods is important. However, in this context, given the sensitive nature of user management and the uniform treatment of similar APIs, it's reasonable to apply a consistent access control level.

**Conclusion**:
Given the similarities with other APIs in the `UserManagerService` class and considering the potential sensitivity of user management operations, the most appropriate access control level for the `isQuietModeEnabled` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures consistency with other similar methods and protects sensitive user information from unauthorized access.
