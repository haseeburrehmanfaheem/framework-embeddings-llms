To determine the access control level for the `getRemainingCreatableUserCount` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
- `canAddMoreUsersOfType`: SYS_OR_SIG
- `preCreateUserWithThrow`: SYS_OR_SIG
- `getRemainingCreatableProfileCount`: SYS_OR_SIG
- `hasBadge`: SYS_OR_SIG
- `isUserTypeEnabled`: SYS_OR_SIG

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. This suggests that the `getRemainingCreatableUserCount` method, being similar in functionality and purpose, should also be restricted to system or signature-level access for security reasons.

Given the context that this method is involved in user management and returns sensitive information about the number of creatable users of a specific type, it's reasonable to conclude that it should have a similar level of protection as the other APIs listed. 

Therefore, based on the similarities with other APIs and considering the principles of access control where reading data (like getting the count of creatable users) is generally less sensitive than modifying it but still requires protection due to its potential impact on system security and user management, we can assign an access control level to `getRemainingCreatableUserCount`.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
