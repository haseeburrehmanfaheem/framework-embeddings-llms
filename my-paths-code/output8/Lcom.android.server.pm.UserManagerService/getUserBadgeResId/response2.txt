Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control levels of similar APIs and their similarities to the `getUserBadgeResId` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getUserIconBadgeResId(I)I`: This API has a similarity of 0.9873342514038086 with the `getUserBadgeResId` method and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId(I)I`: This API has a similarity of 0.9852578043937683 with the `getUserBadgeResId` method and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. `hasBadge(I)Z`: This API has a similarity of 0.9701502323150635 with the `getUserBadgeResId` method and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
4. `getUserBadgeColorResId(I)I`: This API has a similarity of 0.8895895481109619 with the `getUserBadgeResId` method and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
5. `getUserBadgeLabelResId(I)I`: This API has a similarity of 0.8882095813751221 with the `getUserBadgeResId` method and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. The similarities between these APIs and the `getUserBadgeResId` method are relatively high, ranging from 0.8882 to 0.9873.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getUserBadgeResId` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is similar to other APIs that require system or signature-level permission to access.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
