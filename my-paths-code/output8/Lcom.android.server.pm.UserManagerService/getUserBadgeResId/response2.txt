To determine the access control level for the `getUserBadgeResId` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths with varying depths, all of which involve retrieving user information or badge details based on a given parameter `p1`. These paths interact with `UserManagerService` and `mUserTypes` to fetch user types and their corresponding badge resources.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show interactions with `UserManagerService` for getting user info or type, accessing `mUserTypes` for user type details, checking if a badge exists, and retrieving the badge resource ID.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getUserIconBadgeResId(I)I` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves similar steps: getting user info, accessing user types, checking for badges, and returning an icon badge resource.
   - `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId(I)I` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, with a similar pattern of getting user information, accessing user type details, checking for badges, and returning a badge resource without background.

Given the similarities in functionality and code structure between `getUserBadgeResId` and the two provided APIs (`getUserIconBadgeResId` and `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId`), which both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to infer that `getUserBadgeResId` should also be assigned a similar access control level. This is because all these methods deal with sensitive user information (user types, badges) and interact with system services (`UserManagerService`) in a manner that suggests they require a certain level of privilege or signature permission to execute securely.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippets, sink code, and the similarity with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, the final access control level for the `getUserBadgeResId` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects the method's interaction with system services and sensitive user data, aligning with the access control principles demonstrated by similar APIs.
