Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level to the `getPreInstallableSystemPackages` API.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs are related to user management, package installation, and system configuration, which are sensitive operations that require elevated privileges.

The `getPreInstallableSystemPackages` API is also related to package installation and system configuration, as it retrieves a list of pre-installable system packages for a given user type. This operation may involve accessing sensitive system data and configuring system settings, which requires careful control and restriction.

Given the similarities between this API and the provided similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getPreInstallableSystemPackages` API. This ensures that only authorized system or signature-level components can access this API and perform sensitive operations.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
