To determine the access control level for the `removeUser` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets for `removeUser` show various paths (depths) of execution, but they all involve checking user restrictions, removing a user, and interacting with system services like `ActivityManager` and `AppOpsService`. The key aspects to focus on are:

1. **User Restriction Checks**: The API checks if the removal of a managed profile is restricted.
2. **Interaction with System Services**: It interacts with `ActivityManager` to stop the user and with `AppOpsService` to remove the user, which are system-level operations.
3. **Modification of User Data**: The API modifies user data by removing the user, which is a significant operation that requires appropriate permissions.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- **removeUserWhenPossible(IZ)I** and **removeUserEvenWhenDisallowed(I)Z** both have an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG**, indicating they require either system or signature-level permission to execute. These APIs also interact with system services and modify user data, similar to `removeUser`.

Given the similarities in functionality and the need for system-level permissions to perform these operations securely, it's reasonable to conclude that `removeUser` should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the API's functionality, its interaction with system services, and comparison with similar APIs, the access control level for `removeUser` should be **SYS_OR_SIG**.
