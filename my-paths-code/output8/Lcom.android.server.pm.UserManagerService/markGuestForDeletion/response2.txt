Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `markGuestForDeletion` method.

The `markGuestForDeletion` method is used to mark a guest user for deletion. This operation involves modifying user data and requires certain permissions. The method has three paths with different code snippets, but all of them involve checking user restrictions and updating user data.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to user management and restriction, which is similar to the `markGuestForDeletion` method.

Considering the similarities between the `markGuestForDeletion` method and the provided APIs, I believe that the `markGuestForDeletion` method should have a similar access control level. The method involves modifying user data, which requires a certain level of permission to prevent unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similar APIs, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `markGuestForDeletion` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
