Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `setUserIcon` method.

The `setUserIcon` method is similar to other methods in the `UserManagerService` class that modify user data, such as `setUserEnabled`, `setUserAdmin`, `setUserEphemeral`, `removeUserWhenPossible`, and `setUserAccount`. These methods all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to execute.

The `setUserIcon` method also modifies user data by writing a new bitmap icon for the user, which is a sensitive operation. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to this method.

Additionally, the method calls `enforceUserRestriction` with the restriction "no_set_user_icon", which suggests that setting the user icon is a restricted operation that requires special permission.

Based on these considerations, I conclude that the `setUserIcon` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
