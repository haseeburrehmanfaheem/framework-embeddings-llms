Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `getUserBadgeLabelResId` method.

The method is similar to other APIs in the same class, such as `getUserBadgeColorResId`, `getUserBadgeDarkColorResId`, `getUserIconBadgeResId`, and `getUserBadgeResId`, which all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also related to user badges and seem to be handling sensitive information.

The sink code for `getUserBadgeLabelResId` is also similar to the sink code of the other APIs, which suggests that it is handling similar data and operations.

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getUserBadgeLabelResId` method should have a similar access control level to the other APIs in the same class. Since all the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can assign the same level to `getUserBadgeLabelResId`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is based on the similarity between the methods and the fact that they are handling sensitive information related to user badges. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that the method can only be accessed by system or signature-protected components, which is consistent with the handling of sensitive user data.
