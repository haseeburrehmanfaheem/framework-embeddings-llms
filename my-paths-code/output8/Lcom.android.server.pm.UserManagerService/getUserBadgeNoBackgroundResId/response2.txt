To determine the access control level for the `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) that all ultimately lead to retrieving a badge resource ID related to user types or info. These paths involve interactions with `UserManagerService`, accessing user type details, and checking for badges.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show the critical parts of the method where it interacts with sensitive data or operations, such as getting user info, accessing user types, checking for badges, and returning badge resource IDs.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getUserBadgeResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9852578043937683 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method is very similar in terms of functionality, focusing on retrieving a badge resource ID but for the plain badge.
   - `getUserIconBadgeResId(I)I` has a similarity score of 0.9793401956558228 and also an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method retrieves the icon badge resource ID.

Given these similarities and the nature of the operations (accessing user information, badges, and resource IDs), it's clear that `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` deals with sensitive data or functionality related to user management and badges. The high similarity scores with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels indicate that this method likely requires a similar level of protection or restriction.

**Access Control Level Decision**: Considering the method's interactions with potentially sensitive user information, its similarities with other methods that are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, and the general principle of assigning stricter access controls when dealing with user data or system-level functionalities, it is reasonable to conclude that `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
