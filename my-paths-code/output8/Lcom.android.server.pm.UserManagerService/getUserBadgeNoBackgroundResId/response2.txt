Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method.

The method is similar to other APIs in the same class, such as `getUserBadgeResId`, `getUserIconBadgeResId`, `hasBadge`, `getUserBadgeColorResId`, and `getUserBadgeLabelResId`. All of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The similarities between these methods and `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` are high, with similarity scores ranging from 0.877 to 0.985. This suggests that the method is closely related to the other APIs and likely requires a similar level of access control.

Furthermore, the method interacts with sensitive data, such as user badges and icons, which are typically protected by stricter access controls.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getUserBadgeNoBackgroundResId` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, consistent with the other similar APIs in the same class.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
