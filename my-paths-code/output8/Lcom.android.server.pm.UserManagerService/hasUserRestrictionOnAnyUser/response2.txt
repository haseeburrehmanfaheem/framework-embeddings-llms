To determine the access control level for the `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` method checks if a specific user restriction is applied to any user on the device. It does this by iterating over all users, checking their effective restrictions, and returning true if the specified restriction is found.

Looking at the sink code, we can see that it involves:

1. Checking if a restriction is valid (`USER_RESTRICTIONS.contains(p1)`).
2. Getting the calling UID (`Binder.getCallingUid()`).
3. Interacting with the package manager to get packages for the calling UID.
4. Updating user restrictions (`this.mUserRestrictions.put(UserInfo.id, v35)`).

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `hasBaseUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method checks if a base user restriction is applied to a specific user.
2. `getUserRestrictionSources(Ljava/lang/String;I)Ljava/util/List;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method returns the sources of user restrictions for a specific user.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access user restriction information.

Considering the code and the similar APIs, we can conclude that the `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` method also requires system or signature-level permissions to access and update user restriction information. Therefore, the access control level for this method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
