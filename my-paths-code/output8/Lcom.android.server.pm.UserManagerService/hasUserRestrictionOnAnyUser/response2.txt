Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` method.

The method is checking if a specific user restriction is applied to any user. This operation seems to be related to retrieving or querying user restrictions, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper authorization.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `hasBaseUserRestriction`, `getUserRestrictionSources`, `setUserRestriction`, and `getUserRestrictions` all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these operations are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permission.
* The similarities between these APIs and the `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` method are relatively high (above 0.79), indicating that they share similar functionality and security requirements.

Considering the above points, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `hasUserRestrictionOnAnyUser` method, as it is likely to require system or signature-level permission to perform this operation.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
