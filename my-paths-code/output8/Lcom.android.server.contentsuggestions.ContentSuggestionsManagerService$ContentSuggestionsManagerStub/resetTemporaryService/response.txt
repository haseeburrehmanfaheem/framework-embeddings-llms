Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public void resetTemporaryService(int p1){
    this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);
    return;
}
```

The analysis yields the following result in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The method `resetTemporaryService` is invoked on an instance (`this.this$0`), which suggests a potential sink due to the naming similarity with the API name and because it takes the input parameter `p1` as an argument.
- Although there's only one relevant instruction in this case, it still follows at least one of the positive rules (naming similarity and taking input parameters).
- The method invocation directly influences the behavior or outcome of the API, making it a coherent set of instructions for a potential sink. 
- Given the simplicity and directness of this code snippet, there's no need to separate instructions into different sink arrays.
- Since there's only one identified set of instructions contributing to a sink, ranking sensitivity isn't applicable here; however, if more complex scenarios were present, the ranking would prioritize based on data flow influence and parameter usage.
