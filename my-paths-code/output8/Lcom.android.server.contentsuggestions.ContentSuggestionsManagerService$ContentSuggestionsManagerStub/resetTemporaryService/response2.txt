To determine the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet**: The method calls `this.this$0.resetTemporaryService(p1);`, which indicates it is delegating its functionality to another instance's method with the same name. This suggests that the access control level of this method might depend on the access control level of the method it calls.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code is essentially the same as the method call within the `resetTemporaryService` method itself, reinforcing the idea that we're looking at a delegated call.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `setTemporaryService(ILjava/lang/String;I)V`, with an access control level of `NONE`. The similarity score is high (0.8328460454940796), indicating these methods share significant characteristics with `resetTemporaryService`.
   - These similar APIs also delegate their calls to `this.this$0.setTemporaryService(p1, p2, p3);`, which is structurally similar to how `resetTemporaryService` operates.

Given this analysis:
- The method's operation and the operations of its similar counterparts are primarily about delegation. This suggests that the access control level might not be stringent since they do not directly interact with sensitive data or operations but rather pass through to another layer.
- The high similarity score and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` imply that `resetTemporaryService` likely does not require elevated permissions to execute its intended function.

Therefore, considering the delegation nature of the method and the access control levels of its highly similar counterparts, it's reasonable to conclude that `resetTemporaryService` should also have a relatively open access control level.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
