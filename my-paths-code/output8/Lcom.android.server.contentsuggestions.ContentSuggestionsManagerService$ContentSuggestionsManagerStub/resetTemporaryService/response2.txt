To determine the access control level for the `resetTemporaryService` method in the `ContentCaptureManagerService$ContentCaptureManagerServiceStub` class, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The first similar API, `setTemporaryService(ILjava/lang/String;I)V`, has an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that setting a temporary service does not require any specific permissions or restrictions.
   - The second similar API, `setTemporaryComponent(Landroid/content/ComponentName;)V`, also has an access control level of `NONE`. Although it's used in a different context (speech recognition), the fact that it doesn't require strict access control is noteworthy.

2. **Method Semantics**:
   - The method `resetTemporaryService` resets a temporary service based on an integer parameter `p1`, which likely represents a user ID or another form of identifier.
   - Resetting a service might have implications for the current state or functionality provided by the service, but without more context, it's difficult to assess the full security impact.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, if a setter method (which modifies state) requires a certain level of access control, the corresponding getter method (which only reads state) might require less or the same level of restriction.
   - Since both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that modifying or resetting temporary services or components does not pose a significant security risk in these contexts.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the similarities with other APIs and their access control levels, along with considering the general principles of access control in Android, the `resetTemporaryService` method seems to follow the pattern where such operations are not heavily restricted.
   - Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, assigning an access control level of `NONE` to the `resetTemporaryService` method appears reasonable.
