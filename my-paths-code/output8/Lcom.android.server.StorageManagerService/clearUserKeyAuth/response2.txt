To determine the access control level for the `clearUserKeyAuth` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Path 1 checks if the byte array `p3` is empty. If not, it converts the byte array to a hexadecimal string using `HexDump.toHexString(p3)` and then calls `this.mVold.clearUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)`.
   - Path 2 directly encodes the byte array `p3` using `p0.encodeBytes(p3)` and calls `this.mVold.clearUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)`.
   - Path 3 is similar to Path 1 but uses a hardcoded string `"!"` instead of converting the byte array when it's not empty.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves converting a byte array to a string (either through `HexDump.toHexString(p3)` or `p0.encodeBytes(p3)`) and then passing this string along with two integers to `this.mVold.clearUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)`.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs (`addUserKeyAuth(II[B)V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also involve encoding a byte array and passing it along with integers to `this.mVold.addUserKeyAuth(p1, p2, v2)`.

Given the similarities in how these methods handle data (converting byte arrays to strings and then interacting with `mVold` methods), and considering that the similar APIs (`addUserKeyAuth`) are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that the `clearUserKeyAuth` method likely requires a similar level of access control due to its interaction with potentially sensitive data (user key authentication) and system-level operations (`mVold.clearUserKeyAuth`).

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the access control level for the `clearUserKeyAuth` API should be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it involves system or signature-level permissions likely due to its interaction with user authentication data and system-level volume operations.
