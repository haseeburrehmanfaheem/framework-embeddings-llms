To determine the access control level for the `notifyAppIoResumed` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all start with `p0.enforceExternalStorageService();`, which suggests that this method is protected and requires a certain level of access or permission related to external storage services.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve interactions with `mConnections` and `mUidsBlockedOnIo`, which seem to be related to managing connections and tracking blocked I/O operations for different user IDs. These operations imply a need for careful access control to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosures of sensitive information.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API `notifyAppIoBlocked` with a high similarity score has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to notifying about I/O blockages or resumptions are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permissions.
   - Both versions of `notifyAppIoBlocked` involve either updating internal state (`mUidsBlockedOnIo`) based on user IDs or delegating the notification to another controller (`this.mStorageSessionController`). These actions imply a level of trust and privilege, consistent with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.

Given these points:

- The method's initial check `p0.enforceExternalStorageService();` indicates it requires specific permissions.
- The operations within the method (managing connections, updating I/O blockage status) are sensitive and should be protected against unauthorized access.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that such operations are considered to require system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, considering the need for protection of external storage services and the similarity with other APIs that manage I/O blockages, the most appropriate access control level for the `notifyAppIoResumed` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
