To determine the access control level for the `notifyAppIoResumed` method in the `StorageManagerService` class, we should consider the similarities and differences with the provided APIs, their access control levels, and the semantics of these APIs.

1. **Similarity with `notifyAppIoBlocked` API**: This API has a high similarity (above 0.85) with the `notifyAppIoResumed` method, especially in terms of how they interact with `mConnections` and `mUidsBlockedOnIo`. The `notifyAppIoBlocked` API is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires a system or signature-level permission to execute. Given the similarities in their operations (both deal with app IO state changes), it's reasonable to consider a similar access control level for `notifyAppIoResumed`.

2. **Interaction with Sensitive Data**: The method interacts with `mConnections` and `mUidsBlockedOnIo`, which seem to be related to managing app IO operations and their states. Modifying these states (as in the case of `notifyAppIoResumed`) could potentially impact system performance or security, suggesting a need for restricted access.

3. **Comparison with `isAppIoBlocked` API**: Although this API has a lower similarity score, its operation is related to querying the state of app IO, which is less sensitive than modifying it (as in `notifyAppIoResumed`). The `NONE` access control level for `isAppIoBlocked` reflects this, as reading data is generally considered less risky than writing or modifying system states.

4. **Consideration of `onSessionEnded` API**: While its similarity score is lower and it operates in a different context (`StatusBarManagerService`), the fact that it also deals with system-level state changes (session endings) and requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control underscores the importance of securing methods that can alter system or app states.

Given these considerations, the `notifyAppIoResumed` method's ability to modify app IO states and its similarities with other system-level APIs suggests that it should have a restrictive access control level. Since modifying system states (like resuming app IO) is generally more sensitive than querying them, and considering the similarities with `notifyAppIoBlocked`, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems appropriate.
