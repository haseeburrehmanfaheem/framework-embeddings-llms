To determine the access control level for the `getExternalStorageMountMode` method, we need to analyze its code snippets and compare them with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets for `getExternalStorageMountMode` show that it interacts with internal storage management functions, such as `getMountModeInternal` and `getExternalStorageMountMode` of `mStorageManagerInternal`. These interactions suggest that the method is related to retrieving information about the mount mode of external storage, which could be considered a relatively safe operation as it does not directly modify system settings or access sensitive user data.

The sink code provided further emphasizes that the method's primary action is to return an integer value representing the mount mode, without any apparent direct impact on system security or privacy.

Comparing this with the similar API `getTotalBytes(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)J`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, we can observe some similarities. Both methods seem to be focused on retrieving information (either storage size or mount mode) without modifying system settings or accessing sensitive data that would require higher levels of access control.

Given the above analysis and considering the semantics of the APIs provided, it appears that `getExternalStorageMountMode` does not pose significant risks related to privacy, security, or system integrity. Therefore, assigning an access control level similar to that of `getTotalBytes`, which is `NONE`, seems appropriate.
