To determine the access control level for the `getExternalStorageMountMode` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Method Semantics**: The method `getExternalStorageMountMode` appears to retrieve the mount mode of external storage based on a user ID (`p1`) and a string parameter (`p2`). This operation seems to be related to querying or retrieving information about the current state of external storage, which is generally less sensitive than modifying it.

2. **Similar APIs**: The provided similar API is `getTotalBytes` from the `StorageStatsService` class, with an access control level of `NONE`. This method calculates and returns the total bytes of a volume based on its UUID. Although the operations are somewhat different (one retrieves mount mode, the other calculates storage size), both methods are essentially getters that provide information about storage without modifying it.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets for `getExternalStorageMountMode` all involve calling internal methods to retrieve the mount mode (`getMountModeInternal`, `-$Nest$mgetMountModeInternal`, or directly through `mStorageManagerInternal`) and then returning this value. There's no indication of modifying system state, handling sensitive data (beyond what's necessary for determining mount modes), or performing operations that would typically require elevated permissions.

4. **Access Control Principles**: Given that the method is a getter and does not modify system state or handle highly sensitive information, it aligns with the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing it. Therefore, an access control level of `NONE` seems appropriate for this method, as it's primarily involved in retrieving information without posing significant security risks.

Based on these considerations, the final access control level for the `getExternalStorageMountMode` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision reflects the method's nature as a getter that retrieves non-sensitive information about external storage mount modes, aligning with the principles of Android access control and the provided similar API example.
