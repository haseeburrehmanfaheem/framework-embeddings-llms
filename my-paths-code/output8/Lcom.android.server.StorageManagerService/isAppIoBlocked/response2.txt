To determine the access control level for the `isAppIoBlocked` method, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `notifyAppIoBlocked` and `notifyAppIoResumed`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

Given that `isAppIoBlocked` is a getter method and considering the principle that if a setter method requires a certain level of access control, the corresponding getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction (since reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it), we might initially think to assign a lower access control level. However, the similarities in code structure and functionality with `notifyAppIoBlocked` and `notifyAppIoResumed`, which both deal with sensitive operations related to app I/O blocking and resuming, suggest that `isAppIoBlocked` could also be dealing with sensitive information.

Moreover, since `isAppIoBlocked` seems to be querying the status of whether an app's I/O is blocked, which could potentially reveal sensitive information about the system's state or app behavior, it's reasonable to consider a higher level of access control. The fact that both similar APIs (`notifyAppIoBlocked` and `notifyAppIoResumed`) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require significant permissions (either being a system process or signed with the platform key), implies that operations related to app I/O blocking and resuming are sensitive.

However, considering the principle mentioned earlier about getter methods typically requiring less restrictive access control than their corresponding setter methods, and given that `isAppIoBlocked` is essentially a query method, we should weigh whether it truly necessitates the same level of restriction as its setter counterparts. 

Given these considerations and without explicit evidence that reading the I/O block status poses a significant security risk comparable to modifying it (as with `notifyAppIoBlocked` and `notifyAppIoResumed`), one might argue for a slightly less restrictive approach but still within the bounds of protecting system integrity and privacy.

Yet, considering the context provided by similar APIs and the general principle that accessing certain system states should be restricted to prevent misuse or information leakage, assigning an access control level that reflects the sensitivity of the operation is prudent. Thus, aligning with the access control levels of its similar APIs might not be strictly necessary for a getter method but could be justified based on the context of system security and privacy.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level, balancing between the need to protect sensitive information and the nature of the `isAppIoBlocked` method as a query, would lean towards a more restrictive approach due to its interaction with potentially sensitive system states and app behaviors. However, without explicit guidance on the sensitivity of merely reading the I/O block status, we must consider the implications of our choice carefully.

Therefore, considering all provided information and the balance between security and functionality, the access control level for `isAppIoBlocked` should reflect its potential to interact with sensitive system information, albeit as a query method. The final decision on access control should prioritize system security while acknowledging the nature of getter methods.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice reflects a balance between security considerations and the typical treatment of getter methods in Android's access control framework, recognizing that while `isAppIoBlocked` deals with potentially sensitive information, its read-only nature might not necessitate the highest level of restriction akin to its setter counterparts.
