Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getCacheSizeBytes` method.

The `getCacheSizeBytes` method is a getter method that retrieves the cache size in bytes for a given package or user. The method does not modify any data and only reads the cache size from the `StorageStats` object.

Similar APIs, such as `getCacheBytes`, `getCacheQuotaBytes`, `getAllocatableBytes`, and `queryStatsForPackage`, have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also related to retrieving storage statistics or querying package information, which suggests that they require a similar level of access control.

On the other hand, the `getFreeBytes` method has an access control level of `NONE`, which might seem contradictory. However, this method is more related to retrieving free storage space, which is a less sensitive operation compared to retrieving cache size or querying package information.

Considering the similarities and differences between these APIs, I will assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getCacheSizeBytes` method. This is because the method is related to retrieving sensitive storage statistics, and it is consistent with the access control levels assigned to similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `getCacheSizeBytes` method has a consistent access control level with other similar APIs, and it reflects the sensitive nature of retrieving storage statistics.
