To determine the access control level for the `mountObb` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of `mountObb` Method**: This method involves mounting an OBB (Opaque Binary Blob) file, which is a type of file used by Android apps to store large amounts of data. The method takes several parameters including paths, a listener, and an OBB info object. It checks for nullability of some parameters, creates instances of `StorageManagerService$ObbState` and `StorageManagerService$MountObbAction`, and then sends a message to handle the mounting action.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet shows the creation of `StorageManagerService$ObbState` and `StorageManagerService$MountObbAction` objects, which are directly related to managing OBB files on the device.

3. **Similar API - `unmountObb`**: This method has a similarity score of 0.7843597531318665 with `mountObb`, indicating a significant level of similarity in their functionality or implementation. The `unmountObb` method is used to unmount an OBB file and has been assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

Given these points, we can infer the following:

- Both `mountObb` and `unmountObb` deal with managing OBB files on the device.
- The similarity in their operations (mounting vs. unmounting) suggests that they might have similar security considerations.
- The access control level of `NONE` for `unmountObb` implies that this operation is not considered to pose a significant risk or require special permissions beyond what's normally available.

However, managing OBB files can involve interactions with external storage and potentially sensitive data. Despite the similarity with `unmountObb`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, mounting an OBB could potentially introduce risks related to data integrity, privacy, or security if not properly validated and controlled.

Considering these aspects:

- **Mounting an OBB file** involves adding new data to the device, which might require validation to prevent potential security threats.
- The method's interaction with storage and the creation of specific state and action objects suggest a need for careful handling to avoid misuse or exploitation.

Given the information provided and considering the balance between functionality and potential risks, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects the need for some level of protection or validation but does not necessarily require the highest level of system or signature permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis and without explicit indications of high-risk operations (like those requiring `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions), a moderate approach seems appropriate.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
