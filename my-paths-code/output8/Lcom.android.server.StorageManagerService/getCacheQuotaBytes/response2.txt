To determine the access control level for the `getCacheQuotaBytes` method in the `Lcom.android.server.StorageManagerService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The most similar APIs (`getCacheSizeBytes`, `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes`, `getAllocatableBytes`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that methods related to storage management and quota handling are considered sensitive and require a higher level of access control.
   - The `getFreeBytes` method, although somewhat similar in context (dealing with storage), has an access control level of `NONE`. However, its similarity scores are lower compared to the other mentioned APIs, and it deals more with querying free space rather than managing quotas directly.

2. **Method Semantics**:
   - The `getCacheQuotaBytes` method is involved in retrieving cache quota bytes for a given package and user ID. This operation is related to storage management and could potentially reveal sensitive information about the system's storage configuration or usage patterns.
   - Given that setting cache quotas (if such an API exists) would likely require careful control to prevent abuse or denial-of-service conditions, it follows that even reading this information might need some level of restriction to protect system integrity and user data.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - In Android, the principle is that if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.
   - However, considering the context of storage management and the similarities with other APIs that have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it's reasonable to infer that `getCacheQuotaBytes` should also be protected to some extent.

Given these considerations, while the method is a getter and thus might initially seem like it could have a lower access control level, its context within storage management and the similarities with other restricted APIs suggest that it should not be completely open. However, without direct evidence of it being used in a highly sensitive manner or requiring system or signature-level protection for its specific use case, the most cautious approach based on the information provided would lean towards protecting it but recognizing it's primarily an informational method.

Therefore, considering the need to balance security with functionality and the fact that this is a getter method which typically requires less restriction than a setter, but still dealing with potentially sensitive storage management information, the access control level could be considered as `NORMAL`. This reflects a moderate level of protection, acknowledging its role in system management without over-restricting access to informational data.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's functionality, the similarities with other APIs, and general principles of access control in Android, aiming for a balanced approach between security and usability.
