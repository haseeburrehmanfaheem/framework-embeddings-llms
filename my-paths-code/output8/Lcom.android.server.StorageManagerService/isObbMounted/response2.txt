To determine the access control level for the `isObbMounted` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar API, `getMountedObbPath`.

1. **Code Analysis of `isObbMounted`:**
   - The method checks if a given path (`p1`) is present in the `mObbPathToStateMap`.
   - It returns a boolean value indicating whether the path is mounted or not.
   - There's no direct interaction with sensitive data or operations that could potentially harm the system or leak sensitive information.

2. **Comparison with Similar API `getMountedObbPath`:**
   - The `getMountedObbPath` method retrieves the mounted OBB (Opaque Binary Blob) path for a given package.
   - It has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that it does not pose significant risks in terms of data privacy or system integrity.
   - Both methods interact with `mObbPathToStateMap`, which stores information about OBB paths and their states.

3. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   - Given that `isObbMounted` only checks for the presence of a path in a map without accessing, modifying, or leaking sensitive data, it does not pose significant risks.
   - The operation is essentially a read-only check without any potential to cause harm or violate privacy.

Based on this analysis and comparison with the similar API, the `isObbMounted` method should have an access control level of `NONE`, as it does not perform any sensitive operations that could compromise system security or user data.
