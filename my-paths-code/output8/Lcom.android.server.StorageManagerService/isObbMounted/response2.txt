To determine the access control level for the `isObbMounted` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Method Semantics**: The `isObbMounted` method checks if a given OBB (Opaque Binary Blob) path is mounted. It does this by verifying if the path exists in the `mObbPathToStateMap`. This operation is essentially a read operation, checking for the presence of a key in a map.

2. **Similar API Analysis**: The similar API provided is `getMountedObbPath`, which retrieves the mounted OBB path for a given volume ID. Although it operates on related data (OBB paths and their states), its primary function is to return a specific path based on the input, which involves more than just checking for existence.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - The `getMountedObbPath` method has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any specific permissions or restrictions to be called.
   - Given that reading data (in this case, checking if a path is mounted) is generally less sensitive than writing data, and considering the nature of `isObbMounted` as a read operation, it aligns with the principle that getter methods typically require less restrictive access control compared to their corresponding setter methods.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the `isObbMounted` method performs a read operation that is inherently less risky than write operations, and considering the similar API (`getMountedObbPath`) has an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `isObbMounted` should also have a relatively open access control level.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for the `isObbMounted` method would be `NONE`, as it aligns with the principles of Android access control and the observed behavior of similar APIs.
