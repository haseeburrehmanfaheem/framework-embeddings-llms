To determine the access control level for the `getVolumeRecords` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `getVolumes(I)[Landroid/os/storage/VolumeInfo;` has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `getDisks()[Landroid/os/storage/DiskInfo;` also has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `setVolumeUserFlags(Ljava/lang/String;II)V` has a higher access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to its ability to modify volume user flags.

2. **Semantics and Sensitivity**:
   - The `getVolumeRecords` method appears to retrieve information about volume records without modifying any data. This is generally considered a less sensitive operation compared to setting or modifying data.
   - The method's implementation suggests it returns a new `VolumeRecord` object based on the size of `mRecords`, which implies it's providing information rather than altering system state.

3. **Comparison with Provided APIs**:
   - Both `getVolumes` and `getDisks` methods are getters that return information about volumes and disks, respectively, without modifying any data. Their access control level is `NONE`, suggesting that reading such information is not considered sensitive.
   - The `setVolumeUserFlags` method modifies volume flags and requires a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`). This indicates that while reading volume-related information might be unrestricted, modifying it requires more stringent permissions.

Given these considerations:

- **Reading Data vs. Modifying Data**: Since `getVolumeRecords` is involved in reading data (retrieving volume records) rather than modifying it, and considering the similar APIs (`getVolumes`, `getDisks`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that `getVolumeRecords` should also have a relatively low restriction level.
- **Comparison with Modifying Operations**: The presence of a method like `setVolumeUserFlags` with a higher access control level highlights the distinction between reading and writing operations in terms of security sensitivity. However, this does not directly impact the access control level for a getter method unless it poses a specific security risk by exposing sensitive information.

**Conclusion**:

Based on the provided similar APIs and their access control levels, along with the general principle that reading data is less sensitive than modifying it, `getVolumeRecords` should have an access control level that reflects its nature as a getter method. Given that both `getVolumes` and `getDisks` have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the method does not seem to pose a significant security risk by exposing highly sensitive information or modifying system state, the most appropriate access control level for `getVolumeRecords` would be `NONE`.
