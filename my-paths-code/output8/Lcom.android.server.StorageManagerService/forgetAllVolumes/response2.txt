Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `forgetAllVolumes` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `forgetAllVolumes` method appears to be responsible for forgetting all volumes in the storage manager service. It sends messages to the handler, clears records, and updates the primary storage UUID. The sink code entries suggest that this method interacts with sensitive data and performs actions that could potentially impact the system's security or functionality.

Looking at the similar APIs, we can observe the following:

* `removeImeSurface()` and `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout()` have a high similarity score (> 0.9) and are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods seem to be related to system-level operations and require a higher level of access control.
* `notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()` has a moderate similarity score (~ 0.95) and is assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. This method appears to be related to network policy management and may not require the same level of access control as system-level operations.
* `userPresent()` has a moderate similarity score (~ 0.9) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method seems to be related to lock settings and may require a higher level of access control.
* `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync()` has a lower similarity score (~ 0.9) and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This method appears to be related to input method management and may not require any special access control.

Considering the similarities and access control levels of these APIs, it seems that the `forgetAllVolumes` method requires a moderate to high level of access control. Since it interacts with sensitive data and performs system-level actions, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` might be appropriate.

However, given the context of the storage manager service and the nature of the `forgetAllVolumes` method, a more suitable access control level would be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method performs system-level operations and requires a higher level of access control to ensure the integrity and security of the system.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `forgetAllVolumes` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
