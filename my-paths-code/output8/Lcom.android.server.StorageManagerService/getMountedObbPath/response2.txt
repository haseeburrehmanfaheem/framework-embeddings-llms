Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getMountedObbPath` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getMountedObbPath` method appears to be a getter method that returns the absolute path of a mounted OBB (Opaque Binary Blob) file. The method takes a `String` parameter `p1`, which is the raw path of the OBB file.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `unmountObb`: This method unmounts an OBB file and has a similarity score of 0.7067986130714417 with `getMountedObbPath`. The access control level for this method is NONE.
2. `isObbMounted`: This method checks if an OBB file is mounted and has a similarity score of 0.7039861083030701 with `getMountedObbPath`. The access control level for this method is also NONE.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or access controls to function. However, it's essential to note that the `unmountObb` method performs a write operation (unmounting an OBB file), whereas the `getMountedObbPath` method only reads the path of a mounted OBB file.

Given that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and considering the similarities with the other APIs, I would assign an access control level of NONE to the `getMountedObbPath` method. This is because the method only returns information about a mounted OBB file without modifying any data or performing any sensitive operations.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the analysis of the method's functionality, its similarities with other APIs, and the general principle that reading data is less sensitive than modifying it.
