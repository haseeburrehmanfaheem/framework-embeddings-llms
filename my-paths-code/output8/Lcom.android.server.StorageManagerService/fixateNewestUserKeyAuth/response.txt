Based on the provided code, here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "this.mVold.fixateNewestUserKeyAuth(p1);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

In this case, there is only one sink. The method invocation `this.mVold.fixateNewestUserKeyAuth(p1)` follows the positive rule of taking the input parameter `p1` as an argument and has naming similarity with the API name `fixateNewestUserKeyAuth`. Since both paths have the same code, they are considered the same sink.
