Based on the provided code, here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "this.mVold.destroyUserKey(p1);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

In this case, there is only one sink set. The method invocation `this.mVold.destroyUserKey(p1)` follows the positive rule of having input parameters as arguments (`p1` in this case) and is invoked on a class instance (`this.mVold`). This instruction directly contributes to the API's functionality, making it a potential sink.

Note that both provided paths are identical, so there is no need to differentiate between them. The identified sink set remains the same for both cases.
