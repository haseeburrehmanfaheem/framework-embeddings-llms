To determine the access control level for the `destroyUserKey` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**: The two similar APIs provided are `destroyUserStorage` and `createUserKey`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to user key management and storage destruction are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permission.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `destroyUserKey` method directly calls `this.mVold.destroyUserKey(p1);`, which implies it is interacting with a potentially sensitive system component (`mVold`) that manages user keys. This interaction could have security implications, such as removing access to encrypted data or affecting the security posture of the device.

3. **Sink Code**: The sink code `this.mVold.destroyUserKey(p1);` further reinforces the notion that this method is involved in sensitive operations related to user key management, which could impact system security or user data privacy.

Given these points:

- The similarity in functionality and access control levels of the provided APIs (`destroyUserStorage` and `createUserKey`) suggests that `destroyUserKey` should also be treated as a sensitive operation.
- The direct interaction with potentially sensitive system components for key management implies a need for restricted access to prevent unauthorized or malicious activities.

Therefore, considering the semantics of the API, its interactions, and the ground truth from similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `destroyUserKey` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar sensitive operations.
