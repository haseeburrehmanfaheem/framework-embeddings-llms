Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `unmountObb` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `unmountObb` method is used to unmount an OBB (Opaque Binary Blob) file, which is a type of storage that can be mounted and unmounted by the system. The method takes four parameters: the path of the OBB file, a boolean indicating whether to force unmount, an `IObbActionListener` callback, and an integer identifier.

The similar APIs provided are `mountObb` and `getMountedObbPath`. The `mountObb` method is used to mount an OBB file, and it has an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that mounting an OBB file does not require any specific permissions or restrictions. The `getMountedObbPath` method is used to retrieve the path of a mounted OBB file, and it also has an access control level of `NONE`. This implies that reading information about mounted OBB files is not sensitive and does not require any special permissions.

Considering the semantics of the `unmountObb` method, it is likely that unmounting an OBB file does not pose a significant security risk. The method is used to release system resources associated with the OBB file, and it does not appear to modify any sensitive data or perform any privileged operations.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `unmountObb` method. This is because unmounting an OBB file is a relatively benign operation that does not require any specific permissions or restrictions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This assignment is consistent with the access control levels of the similar APIs, `mountObb` and `getMountedObbPath`, which also have an access control level of `NONE`.
