To determine the access control level for the `runIdleMaintenance` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all essentially lead to either checking if a checkpoint is needed and then running idle maintenance or directly running it under certain conditions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `needsCheckpoint`, `supportsBlockCheckpoint`, and `runIdleMaint` methods, which are related to storage management and maintenance tasks.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `runMaintenance()V`: This API has a high similarity score (0.910938024520874) with `runIdleMaintenance`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, which suggests that maintenance operations are sensitive and should be restricted.
   - `abortIdleMaintenance()V`: With a similarity score of 0.8853304386138916, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the notion that operations related to idle maintenance are considered sensitive.

Given these points:

- The operations involved in `runIdleMaintenance` (checking for checkpoints and running maintenance) are related to system-level tasks that could potentially impact performance or data integrity.
- Both similar APIs (`runMaintenance` and `abortIdleMaintenance`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that such maintenance-related operations require elevated permissions.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of storage management and maintenance tasks, and aligning with the access control levels of highly similar APIs, the appropriate access control level for `runIdleMaintenance` should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
