To determine the access control level for the `runIdleMaintenance` method in the `StorageManagerService` class, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

1. **Similarity with `runMaintenance()`**: This API has a high similarity (0.9109380841255188) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code for `runMaintenance` involves calling `runIdleMaintenance`, suggesting that both methods are related to maintenance operations, which might require system or signature-level permissions.

2. **Similarity with `abortIdleMaintenance()`**: This API also has a high similarity (0.8853304982185364) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The operation of aborting idle maintenance is closely related to running idle maintenance, as both are part of managing the device's storage maintenance tasks.

3. **Similarity with `supportsCheckpoint()` and `needsCheckpoint()`**: While these have lower similarities (0.7845637798309326 and 0.7574940323829651, respectively), their access control levels provide insight. `supportsCheckpoint()` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it's a relatively safe operation that doesn't require high-level permissions. On the other hand, `needsCheckpoint()` is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that determining the need for a checkpoint might involve sensitive operations or data.

Given these similarities and access control levels:
- The high similarity with `runMaintenance` and `abortIdleMaintenance`, both of which are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggests that `runIdleMaintenance` could also require system or signature-level permissions due to its involvement in potentially sensitive storage management tasks.
- The lower but still significant similarities with `supportsCheckpoint()` and `needsCheckpoint()` further indicate that the method's operations might involve accessing or modifying data that requires protection.

Considering these points, it seems reasonable to conclude that `runIdleMaintenance` should have an access control level that reflects its potential to interact with sensitive storage management tasks. Therefore, assigning it a level of `SYS_OR_SIG` would be consistent with similar APIs and ensure the security of the device's storage operations.
