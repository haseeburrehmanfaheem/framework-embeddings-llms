To determine the access control level for the `abortIdleMaintenance` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with similar operations, all of which involve calling `abortIdleMaint` on an object (`this.mVold` or `p0`). This suggests that the method is interacting with storage management functionality.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets also point towards interactions with storage management, specifically aborting idle maintenance tasks.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `runIdleMaintenance()V` has a similarity score of 0.8853304386138916 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method runs idle maintenance, which is closely related to the functionality of aborting such maintenance.
   - `runMaintenance()V` has a similarity score of 0.8373569846153259 and also an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although named slightly differently, its operation (running maintenance) is conceptually similar to aborting it.

Given these points:
- The operations in the code snippets and sink codes are related to managing storage or device maintenance tasks.
- Similar APIs (`runIdleMaintenance` and `runMaintenance`) that interact with maintenance tasks have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions due to their potential impact on system resources and security.

Considering the above analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that `abortIdleMaintenance` should also require a similar level of access control because aborting idle maintenance could potentially affect system performance or security, similar to running such tasks.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
