Based on the provided information, we can analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `abortIdleMaintenance` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

* `runIdleMaintenance()` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
* `runMaintenance()` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
* `fstrim()` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
* `cancelRequestAddTile()` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. This is likely due to the fact that they interact with sensitive storage management functionality.

The `abortIdleMaintenance` method appears to be related to storage management, as it calls the `abortIdleMaint` method on the `mVold` object. Given its similarity to the other APIs, it is likely that this method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `abortIdleMaintenance` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
