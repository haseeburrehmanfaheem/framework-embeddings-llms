To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The given `onReceive` method has the following code:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
And the sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. The first similar API has a similarity score of 1.0 and an access control level of `NONE`. Its code is almost identical to the given `onReceive` method:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0, p2, p1);
v1.start();
```
2. The second similar API has a similarity score of 0.9965633153915405 and an access control level of `NONE`. Its code is also very similar to the given `onReceive` method:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Both similar APIs have the same access control level (`NONE`) and their code snippets are nearly identical to the given `onReceive` method. This suggests that the `onReceive` method is likely to have the same access control level as the similar APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `onReceive` method is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
