To determine the access control level for the `startActivityAsUserByIntent` method, we need to analyze the provided information, including the code snippets, similar APIs, and their assigned access control levels.

The `startActivityAsUserByIntent` method is part of the `CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl` class and interacts with sensitive components such as `ActivityTaskManagerInternal` and `DevicePolicyEventLogger`. The method's functionality involves starting an activity as a specific user, which can have security implications.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. **startActivityAsUser**: This API has a similarity score ranging from 0.876 to 0.919 with the `startActivityAsUserByIntent` method and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The high similarity suggests that these methods share common security concerns, such as interacting with user profiles and activity management.

2. **canConfigureInteractAcrossProfiles** and **canInteractAcrossProfiles**: Both of these APIs are also part of the `CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl` class and deal with profile interactions. They have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that their functionality, which involves checking permissions across profiles, requires system or signature-level protection.

3. **startActivityAndWait**: This API is from a different class (`ActivityTaskManagerService`) but has similarities in terms of activity management. It also requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, highlighting the sensitivity of starting activities and the need for strict access control.

4. **resetInteractAcrossProfilesAppOps**: Although this method has some similarity, its assigned access control level is `NONE`, which seems less relevant for determining the access control of `startActivityAsUserByIntent` due to the differences in their functionalities and security implications.

Given these observations:

- The high similarity with `startActivityAsUser`, which requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.
- The involvement of sensitive operations like starting activities as specific users and interacting with device policy event loggers.
- The consistent requirement for `SYS_OR_SIG` access control across similar APIs that deal with profile interactions and activity management.

It is reasonable to conclude that the `startActivityAsUserByIntent` method should also require a high level of access control to protect against potential security risks associated with its functionality.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `startActivityAsUserByIntent` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
