Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `getHibernationStatsForUser` API.

The similar APIs provided have the following access control levels:

* `isHibernatingForUser`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `getHibernatingPackagesForUser`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `setHibernatingForUser`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `getBlockedRatings`: NONE
* `createProfileForUserEvenWhenDisallowedWithThrow`: SYS_OR_SIG

The `getHibernationStatsForUser` API is similar to the other APIs in the `AppHibernationService` class, which all have a access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This suggests that the `getHibernationStatsForUser` API should also have a similar access control level.

Additionally, the `getHibernationStatsForUser` API is handling sensitive information related to app hibernation, which requires a certain level of access control to prevent unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the sensitivity of the information being handled, I assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to the `getHibernationStatsForUser` API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
