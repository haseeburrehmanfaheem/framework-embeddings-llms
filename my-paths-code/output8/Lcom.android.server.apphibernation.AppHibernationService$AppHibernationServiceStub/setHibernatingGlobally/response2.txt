Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `setHibernatingGlobally` method.

The `setHibernatingGlobally` method is used to set the hibernation state for a package globally. This operation requires careful consideration of security and access control, as it can impact the behavior of multiple users and packages.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `setHibernatingForUser` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission to set hibernation state for a user.
* `isHibernatingGlobally`, `isHibernatingForUser`, and `getHibernationStatsForUser` all have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that querying hibernation states also requires system or signature-level permission.

Given the similarities in functionality and security requirements, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setHibernatingGlobally` method. This ensures that only authorized system components or applications with the necessary signature can modify the global hibernation state.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the need to restrict access to this method, ensuring that only trusted and authorized components can modify the global hibernation state.
