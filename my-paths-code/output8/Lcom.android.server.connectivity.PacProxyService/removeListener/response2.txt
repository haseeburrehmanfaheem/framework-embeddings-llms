To determine the access control level for the `removeListener` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided `removeListener` method has a simple implementation:
```java
public void removeListener(IPacProxyInstalledListener p1){
    String v1 = new String(1);
    boolean v3 = this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1);
    return;
}
```
The key operation here is the call to `this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1)`, which is also present in the sink code. This line suggests that the method is removing a listener from a callback list.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. **unregisterCallback(Landroid/debug/IAdbCallback;)V**:
   - Similarity Score: 0.9851925373077393
   - Access Control Level: NONE
   - Code: `boolean v1 = this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1);`
   
2. **unregisterListener(Landroid/os/storage/IStorageEventListener;)V**:
   - Similarity Score: 0.9826120734214783
   - Access Control Level: NONE
   - Code: `boolean v2 = this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1); return;`

Both similar APIs have an access control level of **NONE**, and their code snippets are very similar to the sink code of the `removeListener` method. The primary action in all cases is the removal of a callback or listener from a list, which does not inherently suggest a dangerous or system/signature-level operation.

Given this analysis, the `removeListener` method appears to perform a basic operation that does not pose significant security risks or require special permissions. Therefore, it should have an access control level similar to its counterparts.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
