To determine the access control level for the `removeListener` method in the `PacProxyService` class, we should consider the similarities and access control levels of the provided similar APIs. 

The `removeListener` method is used to remove a listener from the service, which is essentially an operation that modifies the state of the service by removing a callback. The method's sink code, `boolean v3 = this.mCallbacks.unregister(p1);`, directly interacts with the `mCallbacks` object to unregister the provided listener.

Looking at the similar APIs:

1. **unregisterCallback** in `AdbService`: This has an access control level of `NONE`. It performs a similar operation by unregistering a callback.
2. **unregisterListener** in `StorageManagerService`: Also has an access control level of `NONE`, and it unregisters a listener, which is conceptually similar to removing a callback or listener.
3. **unregisterShortcutChangeCallback** in `LauncherAppsService$LauncherAppsImpl`: This method also has an access control level of `NONE` and is involved in unregistering a callback related to shortcut changes.

All the methods that are directly comparable (in terms of unregistering or removing listeners/callbacks) have an access control level of `NONE`. 

However, it's also worth noting the **addListener** method in the same `PacProxyService` class has an access control level of `NORMAL`. This suggests that while adding a listener might require some level of access control (possibly due to the sensitivity of the data or operations the listener can perform), removing one might not be as restricted, given the pattern observed in similar APIs.

Given these observations and considering the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, but also taking into account that removing a listener is a form of modification, we should align with the most similar operations' access control levels provided. Since all direct comparisons for unregistering or removing listeners/callbacks have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the specific context might not necessitate higher restriction for removal compared to addition, the informed decision would be to assign an access control level that matches these similarities.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the analysis of similar APIs, the final access control level for the `removeListener` API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
