Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `openTuner` method.

The similar APIs have the following access control levels:

* `resumeRecording`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `createTestSession`: NORMAL
* `requestDescrambler`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `relayoutOverlayView`: SYS_OR_SIG

These APIs are related to managing sessions, resources, or overlays, and most of them require a system or signature-level permission (SYS_OR_SIG) to access. The only exception is `createTestSession`, which has a normal access control level.

Considering the semantics of the `openTuner` method, which involves opening a tuner session and potentially accessing sensitive radio frequency information, I believe that a higher level of access control is necessary to prevent unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, I assign the following access control level to the `openTuner` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level privileged applications can access the `openTuner` method, preventing potential security risks and protecting sensitive radio frequency information.
