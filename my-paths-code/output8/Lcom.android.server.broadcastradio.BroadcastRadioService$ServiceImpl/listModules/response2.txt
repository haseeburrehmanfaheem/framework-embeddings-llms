To determine the access control level for the `listModules` method in the `BroadcastRadioService$ServiceImpl` class, we should consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar API is `getSupportedTypes()[I` in the `HdmiControlService$BinderService` class, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given that:
- The `listModules` method interacts with internal components of the `BroadcastRadioService`, such as `mV1Modules` and `mHal2`, suggesting it deals with system-level functionality.
- The method does not appear to directly modify sensitive data but rather retrieves a list of modules, which could be considered less sensitive than operations that modify system settings or data.
- However, the fact that it lists modules related to broadcast radio services might imply access to system-level information that should be restricted to system or signature applications to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

Considering these points and comparing with the `getSupportedTypes()[I` API:
- Both APIs seem to deal with retrieving information (types of supported devices for `getSupportedTypes()` and list of modules for `listModules()`), which suggests they might not require the highest level of protection since they are essentially read operations.
- However, given that these operations are within system services and could potentially expose system capabilities or configurations, a certain level of access control is justified.

Given the similarity in functionality (retrieving information) and the context (system service), but also considering that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing it, we might lean towards a slightly more restrictive access control than `NONE` but not as high as `DANGEROUS`. The comparison API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that system or signature-level access is required for similar operations.

Therefore, considering the need to balance accessibility with security and given the system-level nature of the information being retrieved, the most appropriate access control level for the `listModules` method would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice reflects a moderate level of restriction that is suitable for system services accessing internal configurations or lists of modules without directly modifying sensitive data or posing an immediate security risk. However, since the provided comparison API (`getSupportedTypes()[I`) has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the system-level context of both APIs, one could argue for a more restrictive approach:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This would align with the principle that if a getter method is protected at a certain level, the corresponding setter (if it exists) should be secured at an equal or higher level, and reflects the system-level sensitivity of the information being accessed. Given this context and for consistency with the provided example, the latter might be more appropriate.
