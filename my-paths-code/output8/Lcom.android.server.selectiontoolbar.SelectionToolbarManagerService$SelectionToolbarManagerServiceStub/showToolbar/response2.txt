To determine the access control level for the `showToolbar` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, interacting with `AbstractPerUserSystemService` and `RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService`. It involves checking services for a specific user, potentially creating or using remote services, and calling methods like `onShow` or executing lambda expressions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve service lookups, creations of `RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService`, and method calls on these services. These operations seem to be related to managing selection toolbars across different users or contexts.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `hideToolbar(JI)V` with a similarity score of 0.9793640971183777 and an access control level of NONE.
   - `dismissToolbar(JI)V` with a similarity score of 0.9587364196777344 and an access control level of NONE.

Given the high similarity scores between `showToolbar` and these two APIs, and considering their access control levels are both NONE, it suggests that these methods operate within a similar security context or have comparable requirements for access control.

**Analysis**:
- The operations in `showToolbar`, such as showing a toolbar for a specific user or context, do not inherently suggest a need for elevated permissions (like DANGEROUS) based on the provided code and comparisons.
- The interactions with services and potential remote execution do not explicitly indicate a requirement for SYSTEM or SIGNATURE level access control (SYS_OR_SIG) without more context on how these services are secured or what data they handle.
- The similarity with `hideToolbar` and `dismissToolbar`, both having NONE as their access control level, implies that the operations involved in managing toolbars might not require strict access controls.

**Conclusion**:
Given the information provided and the similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of NONE, it's reasonable to conclude that the `showToolbar` method would also have a similar access control requirement. Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
