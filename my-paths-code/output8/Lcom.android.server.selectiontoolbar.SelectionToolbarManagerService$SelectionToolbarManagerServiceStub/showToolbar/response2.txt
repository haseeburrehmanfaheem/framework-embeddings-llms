To determine the access control level for the `showToolbar` method in the `SelectionToolbarManagerService$SelectionToolbarManagerServiceStub` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs provided (`hideToolbar`, `dismissToolbar`, `onSessionCreated`, `createSession`, `onTranslationCapabilitiesRequest`) all have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that these methods do not require specific permissions or restrictions to be called, possibly because they are part of a system service and are managed internally by the Android framework.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code entries for `showToolbar` involve interactions with `AbstractPerUserSystemService`, `RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService`, and other internal services. These interactions suggest that the method is involved in managing or interacting with system-level services, which might not require explicit user permissions but could be restricted based on the caller's identity (e.g., UID) or other system-level access controls.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - In Android, if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction. However, since `showToolbar` seems to be modifying state or triggering actions rather than simply retrieving information, we should consider whether it poses any security risks.
   - The principle that writing data usually poses a greater security risk than reading data suggests that if there's a corresponding getter method (not explicitly mentioned), it might have a lower access control level. However, without explicit evidence of a related getter method or its access control, we focus on `showToolbar` itself.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the internal nature of these services which likely do not expose sensitive user data directly but could impact system behavior, a reasonable conclusion might lean towards a less restrictive access control.
   - However, without explicit evidence of security risks or the need for higher protection (like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`), and considering the method's role in a system service which is typically managed by the system itself, we should align with the least privilege principle while also acknowledging the system service context.

Based on this analysis, assigning an access control level of `NONE` seems reasonable for the `showToolbar` method, as it aligns with similar APIs and reflects the internal management nature of system services without explicit indications of higher security risks or requirements for restricted access.
