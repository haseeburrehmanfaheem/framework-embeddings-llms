To determine the access control level for the `hideToolbar` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, interacting with `AbstractPerUserSystemService` and `RemoteSelectionToolbarRenderService`. These services seem to be related to managing selection toolbars, which are UI components.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve getting a service for a user, creating or ensuring a remote service instance, and then calling methods like `hideToolbar` or `onHide` on these services. This suggests that the method is involved in hiding or dismissing UI elements related to selection toolbars.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `showToolbar`: This API has an access control level of `NONE`. Its code involves similar operations, such as getting a service for a user and creating/using a remote service instance to show a toolbar.
   - `dismissToolbar`: Also with an access control level of `NONE`, this method dismisses a toolbar. The operation is somewhat opposite but related in context to hiding a toolbar.

Given the information:
- Both similar APIs (`showToolbar` and `dismissToolbar`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that operations related to showing, dismissing, or hiding toolbars are not considered sensitive enough to require higher access control levels like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The method's interactions with services and its purpose (hiding a toolbar) do not inherently imply a need for elevated permissions or access controls beyond what is typical for UI-related operations.

**Conclusion**: Based on the similarity in functionality with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE` and considering the nature of the operation (hiding a UI component), it's reasonable to conclude that the `hideToolbar` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.
