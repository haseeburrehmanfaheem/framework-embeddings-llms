Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `hideToolbar` method.

The similar APIs provided have the following characteristics:

* `showToolbar`: Has a similarity of 0.9793639779090881 with the `hideToolbar` method and has an access control level of NONE.
* `dismissToolbar`: Has a similarity of 0.9637356400489807 with the `hideToolbar` method and has an access control level of NONE.
* `onSessionCreated`, `onTranslationCapabilitiesRequest`, and `createSession`: Have lower similarities (less than 0.8) with the `hideToolbar` method, but all have an access control level of NONE.

Considering the similarities and access control levels of these APIs, it appears that the `hideToolbar` method is related to managing a toolbar or session, which is similar to the other APIs listed. Since all the similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, it suggests that the `hideToolbar` method does not require any specific access control restrictions.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that the `hideToolbar` method should have an access control level of NONE.

  "access_control_level": "NONE"
