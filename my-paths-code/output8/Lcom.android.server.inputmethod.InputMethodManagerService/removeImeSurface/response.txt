Based on the provided code snippet for the `removeImeSurface` API, let's analyze it step by step to identify potential sinks.

1. The method `obtainMessage` is invoked on `this.mHandler`, which could be considered an auxiliary operation as it's obtaining a message instance from a handler.
2. The message obtained is then sent to its target using the `sendToTarget` method. This method invocation has naming similarity with the API name in terms of being part of the process initiated by `removeImeSurface`.

However, considering the positive rules provided:
- There's no direct method invocation that takes input parameters as arguments (since there are no input parameters to this method).
- The return value isn't directly returned by the API; instead, it's used internally.
- No new objects are created with data flow from API parameters (as there are none).

Despite these observations, given the simplicity of the API and considering all instructions for small APIs as part of a sink when no clear sinks are identified under the positive rules, we can consider the entire method body as contributing to a single sink.

Here's how you could represent this in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Message v2 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1060);",
      "v2.sendToTarget();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This representation captures the sequence of operations within the `removeImeSurface` method, acknowledging that for small APIs with straightforward logic and no clear data flow or parameter usage indicating specific sinks, all instructions can be considered part of a sink.
