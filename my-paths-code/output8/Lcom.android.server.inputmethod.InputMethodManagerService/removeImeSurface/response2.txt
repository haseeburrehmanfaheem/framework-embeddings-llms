To determine the access control level for the `removeImeSurface` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `removeImeSurface` method sends a message to a handler with the code `1060`. This action is similar to the actions taken by the provided similar APIs, where messages are sent to handlers with different codes.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()V**: This API has an access control level of `NORMAL` and sends a message with code `20`. The similarity score with `removeImeSurface` is `0.9672578573226929`, indicating a high degree of similarity in their implementation or purpose.
   - **forgetAllVolumes()V**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and sends a message with code `10`. The similarity score with `removeImeSurface` is `0.955288290977478`, also indicating a high degree of similarity.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose any security risk.
   - `NORMAL`: Used for methods that are generally safe but might have some implications if misused (e.g., affecting user experience or data in non-critical ways).
   - `DANGEROUS`: Applies to methods that can cause significant harm, such as accessing sensitive data or performing actions with financial implications.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system or signature-level permissions, which are typically required for operations that significantly impact the system's functionality or security.

Given the high similarity scores and the nature of the operations (sending messages to handlers), we can infer that `removeImeSurface` likely deals with internal state management related to input method editors (IMEs). The critical aspect here is whether this operation could potentially be used in a way that compromises system security, user data, or causes significant disruption.

Since both similar APIs deal with sending messages and have access control levels of `NORMAL` and `SYS_OR_SIG`, respectively, we must consider the potential impact of removing an IME surface. This action seems more related to managing or adjusting the user interface or input method rather than accessing sensitive information or performing dangerous operations.

However, without explicit details on what `1060` represents in terms of system functionality, we lean towards caution and the provided similarities. Given that one similar API is classified as `SYS_OR_SIG` (which typically involves significant system impact) and the other as `NORMAL`, but both are highly similar to `removeImeSurface`, it's reasonable to consider the potential system implications of removing an IME surface.

Considering these points, if we had to choose based on the information given and without specific knowledge of what message code `1060` implies in terms of security or system impact, the most cautious approach would be to align with the more restrictive but still plausible option based on similarity. However, since both provided examples are highly similar and deal with internal messaging which might not directly imply a dangerous operation but could have system-level implications (especially considering one is marked as `SYS_OR_SIG`), we should consider what removing an IME surface would entail in terms of security and functionality.

Given the lack of explicit danger or sensitivity, and considering the operations are more about management rather than data access or financial transactions, but still potentially impactful on the system's state (especially regarding input methods which could be considered part of the system's functionality), a balanced approach seems necessary.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
This choice reflects a balance between the potential for system impact and the lack of clear evidence suggesting it poses a significant danger or requires signature-level permissions. The high similarity with `notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()` which is classified as `NORMAL` also supports this decision, considering both operations seem to be about internal management rather than accessing sensitive data or performing dangerous actions directly.
