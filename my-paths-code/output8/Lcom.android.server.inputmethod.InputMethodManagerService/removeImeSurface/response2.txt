Based on the provided information and similar APIs, we can analyze the access control level for the `removeImeSurface` method.

The `removeImeSurface` method sends a message to a handler with the code `1060`, which is likely an internal implementation detail. The similar APIs provided also send messages to handlers, but with different codes and in different contexts.

Looking at the similar APIs:

* `notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()` has a similarity of 0.9672577977180481 and an access control level of NORMAL. This method is related to network policy management and sends a message with code 20.
* `forgetAllVolumes()` has a similarity of 0.955288290977478 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This method is related to storage management and sends a message with code 10.
* `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync()` has a similarity of 0.9407423734664917 and an access control level of NONE. This method is also related to input method management, similar to the original method, and sends a message with code 1061.
* `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout()` and `userPresent()` have similarities of 0.9273983240127563 and 0.9211652278900146, respectively, and both have access control levels of SYS_OR_SIG. These methods are related to lock settings and send messages with different codes.

Considering the similarities and access control levels of these APIs, we can observe that:

* The `removeImeSurface` method is most similar to `notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()` (similarity 0.9672577977180481) and `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync()` (similarity 0.9407423734664917), which are both related to internal implementation details.
* The access control levels of the similar APIs range from NONE to SYS_OR_SIG, but most of them have a level of SYS_OR_SIG or NORMAL.

Given that the `removeImeSurface` method is an internal implementation detail and sends a message to a handler, it's likely that this method does not require a high level of access control. However, considering the similarities with other APIs and the fact that it's related to input method management, we can assign a moderate access control level.

The final access control level for the `removeImeSurface` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarity with `notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()` and the internal implementation detail nature of the method, which suggests that a NORMAL access control level is sufficient.
