Based on the provided code, here's the analysis:

The API `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` takes an `IBinder` object as a parameter and uses it to create a new `Message` object. The `Message` object is then sent to its target using the `sendToTarget()` method.

Here are the potential sinks in JSON format:
```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Message v1 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1061, p1);",
      "v1.sendToTarget();"
    ]
  ]
}
```
The instructions `Message v1 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1061, p1);` and `v1.sendToTarget();` are part of the same sink because they have a direct dataflow link: the output of `obtainMessage` (the `Message` object) is used as input for `sendToTarget`. Additionally, the `IBinder` object `p1` is passed to `obtainMessage`, which meets one of the positive rules. 

Note that there's only one sink in this API, and it involves the creation and sending of a `Message` object using the provided `IBinder` parameter.
