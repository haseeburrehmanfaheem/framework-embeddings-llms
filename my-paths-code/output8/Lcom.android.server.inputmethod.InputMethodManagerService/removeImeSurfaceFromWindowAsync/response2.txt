Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, we can make an informed decision about the access control level for the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method.

The similar APIs provided are primarily from the `LockSettingsService` class, which deals with lock settings and biometric authentication. These methods have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

However, the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method is part of the `InputMethodManagerService` class, which manages input methods. The method's purpose is to remove an IME (Input Method Editor) surface from a window asynchronously. This operation does not seem to involve sensitive data or actions that would typically require system-level permissions.

Despite this, one of the similar APIs provided is also from the `InputMethodManagerService` class: `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem`. This method has been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Given the similarity in their code structure (both involve sending messages to a handler) and the fact that they are part of the same service, it suggests that the access control level for `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` should be consistent with the security practices applied to other methods within the same service.

Therefore, considering the similarities in code pattern and the context provided by similar APIs, especially those within the same `InputMethodManagerService` class, the access control level for `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` should be aligned with the more restrictive and cautious approach observed in the provided examples.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects the importance of maintaining consistency in security practices within the service and acknowledging that operations related to input method management, even if they seem less sensitive, are still part of a broader system that requires careful access control.
