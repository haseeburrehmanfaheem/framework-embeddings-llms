To determine the access control level for the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` sends a message to a handler with a specific code (1061) and an `IBinder` object as data. This operation seems to be related to inter-process communication or handling events within the system, which might not directly expose sensitive user data but could potentially impact system behavior.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves obtaining a message from a handler and sending it to its target. This is a common pattern in Android for handling asynchronous operations or communicating between threads. It does not directly imply access to sensitive information but indicates internal system communication.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **userPresent(I)V**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its purpose seems related to notifying the system about user presence, which could be a system-internal event.
   - **scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout(I)V**: Also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method appears to schedule a timeout related to biometric authentication, implying system-level functionality without direct user data exposure.

Given these points:
- The operations seem to be system-internal and do not directly involve sensitive user data.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that the operations are significant enough to require system or signature-level permission but are not exposing dangerous or normally protected information directly.

Considering the above analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the system-internal nature of the operation and the levels assigned to similar APIs.
