Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `getInputMethodList` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getAwareLockedInputMethodList(II)Ljava/util/List;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
2. `getEnabledInputMethodSubtypeList(Ljava/lang/String;Z)Ljava/util/List;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
3. `getEnabledInputMethodList(I)Ljava/util/List;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
4. `getTvInputState(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with an access control level of `NONE`
5. `getLastResumedActivityUserId()I` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`

The first three similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the input method list or related data. The fourth API has an access control level of `NONE`, but its similarity score is relatively low (0.758773148059845), and it belongs to a different class (`TvInputManagerService$BinderService`). The fifth API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, but its similarity score is also relatively low (0.7542469501495361).

Considering the similarities in code structure and functionality between the `getInputMethodList` method and the first three similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getInputMethodList` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getInputMethodList` method.

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
