Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, we can make an informed decision about the access control level for the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method.

The similar APIs provided are all from the `LockSettingsService` class and have a high similarity score (above 0.95) with the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method. They all interact with the same sink code, which involves sending messages to a handler using `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget`. These APIs are related to lock settings and authentication, which suggests that they require a certain level of access control.

All the similar APIs have an assigned access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. This is likely due to the sensitive nature of lock settings and authentication data.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also requires a similar level of access control. Although input method picker functionality may not be as sensitive as lock settings or authentication, it still involves interacting with system-level components and handling user input, which warrants some level of protection.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their assigned access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method.

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
