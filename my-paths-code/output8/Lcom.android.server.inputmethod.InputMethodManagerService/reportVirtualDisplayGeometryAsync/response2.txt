To determine the access control level for the `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The most similar API in terms of functionality is `getDisplayInfo(I)Landroid/view/DisplayInfo;` from `Lcom.android.server.display.DisplayManagerService$BinderService`, with a similarity score ranging from 0.708 to 0.854. This API has an access control level of **NONE**.
   - Other similar APIs like `moveRootTaskToDisplay(II)V` and `isDeviceSecure(II)Z` have higher access control levels (**SYS_OR_SIG**), but their functionalities and contexts seem more sensitive or system-critical than simply retrieving display information.

2. **Method Semantics**:
   - The `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` method involves reporting the geometry of a virtual display to an input method client. This operation seems to be related to managing and coordinating display information, which is somewhat similar to the `getDisplayInfo` method but in the context of input methods.
   - The method checks for the existence of a display based on the provided ID (`p2`) and handles exceptions if the client (`p1`) is null. This suggests that while it does interact with system-level components (like display managers), its primary function is not as sensitive or system-critical as those requiring **SYS_OR_SIG** access.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Given that `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` deals with reporting display geometry, which can be considered less sensitive than operations that directly modify system states (like moving tasks between displays or checking device security), it's reasonable to infer its access control level should not be as restrictive as **SYS_OR_SIG**.
   - Since the method is involved in asynchronous reporting and does not seem to pose a significant risk in terms of data privacy or system integrity, an access control level of **NONE** seems plausible. This aligns with the access control level of the most similar API (`getDisplayInfo`) which also deals with display information.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis and considering the method's functionality and similarity to other APIs, especially `getDisplayInfo` which has an access control level of **NONE**, it is reasonable to conclude that `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` should have a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
