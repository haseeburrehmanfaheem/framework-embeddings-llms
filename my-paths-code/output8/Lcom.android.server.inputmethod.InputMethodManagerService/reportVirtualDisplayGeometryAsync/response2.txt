To determine the access control level for the `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` involves getting display information using `getDisplayInfo(p2)` from `mDisplayManagerInternal`. It checks if the result is null and handles exceptions or invalid input (e.g., `p1 == 0`). This suggests that the method interacts with system-level components (`DisplayManagerInternal`) but does not directly expose sensitive user data or perform dangerous operations like sending SMS, making calls, or accessing external storage.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code `['DisplayInfo v1 = this.mDisplayManagerInternal.getDisplayInfo(p2);']` indicates that the method retrieves display information based on an input parameter `p2`. This operation seems to be related to managing or querying display settings rather than accessing sensitive data or performing actions that could compromise user privacy or security.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getDisplayInfo(I)Landroid/view/DisplayInfo;`) have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with display information and are considered to pose no significant risk regarding user data privacy or security.
   - The high similarity scores (0.8547736406326294 and 0.8480161428451538) suggest that the behavior and functionality of these APIs are closely related to the `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` method, implying similar security implications.

Given this analysis, since the `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` method does not perform operations that could compromise user privacy or security (like accessing sensitive data, making calls, sending SMS, etc.), and considering its similarity with other APIs classified as `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` should also be `NONE`.

**Access Control Level:**
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
