To determine the access control level for the `getLightState` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `setLightStates`: This API has a similarity of 0.8381034135818481 and 0.7153475880622864 with the `getLightState` method. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `getPrintJobInfos`: This API has a similarity of 0.7627639174461365 with the `getLightState` method. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. `getLights`: This API has a similarity of 0.7435541152954102 with the `getLightState` method. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

All similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that the `getLightState` method should also have a similar or lower access control level.

However, since the `getLightState` method is a getter method, it's likely to have a lower access control level compared to the setter methods like `setLightStates`. 

Considering the similarities and the fact that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, we can assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getLightState` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This assignment is based on the provided information and the general principle that getter methods typically require less restrictive access control compared to setter methods.
