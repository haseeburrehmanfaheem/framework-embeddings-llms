Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `getLights` API.

The `getLights` API is a getter method that returns a list of lights. The similar APIs provided are `getLightState` and `setLightStates`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

However, as mentioned in the problem statement, if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction, since reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it. 

Given that `getLights` is a getter method and its purpose is to retrieve information about lights, which is relatively less sensitive compared to setting light states, I would assign a lower access control level.

Therefore, considering the similarity in functionality and the general principle of access control in Android, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getLights` API.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
