To determine the access control level for the `setLightStates` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - The method has multiple paths, but they all seem to deal with setting light states based on various conditions such as checking if a session is registered or not, validating light IDs, and handling requests.
   - It interacts with system lights (as indicated by `isSystemLight()` checks) and modifies their states, which suggests it's dealing with sensitive operations that could potentially impact the system's functionality or security.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `getPrintJobInfos(II)Ljava/util/List;` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission to access.
   - Another similar API, `getLightState(I)Landroid/hardware/lights/LightState;`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method interacts with light states and checks if a light is a system light, suggesting that operations related to light management are considered sensitive.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets provided show interactions with native methods for getting light colors, setting light states, and managing requests. These operations imply direct manipulation of hardware or system-level resources.
   - Specifically, `LightsService$LightImpl.setLightLocked(v41, 0, 0, 0, 0);` suggests a low-level operation that could affect the system's lighting, potentially requiring privileged access.

Given these observations:
- The method `setLightStates` deals with sensitive operations related to system lights and their states.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores also require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their interaction with system resources.
- The sink code involves low-level system interactions that could impact the device's functionality or security.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of the operations performed by `setLightStates` and the precedent set by similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also require a high level of access control.

**Access Control Level Decision**:
Given the analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `setLightStates` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs that interact with system resources and perform sensitive operations.
