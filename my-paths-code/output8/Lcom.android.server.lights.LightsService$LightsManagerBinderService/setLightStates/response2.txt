To determine the access control level for the `setLightStates` method in the `LightsService$LightsManagerBinderService` class, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with similar APIs.

The `setLightStates` method is used to set the states of lights on a device. It takes an `IBinder` token, an array of light IDs, and an array of `LightState` objects as parameters. The method checks if the token is valid, if the light IDs are valid, and then sets the corresponding light states.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `getPrintJobInfos(II)Ljava/util/List;` in `Lcom/android/server/print/PrintManagerService$PrintManagerImpl`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8938587307929993 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `getLightState(I)Landroid/hardware/lights/LightState;` in `Lcom/android/server/lights/LightsService$LightsManagerBinderService`: This API has multiple similarity scores (0.8381034135818481, 0.8291804790496826, and 0.7825383543968201) and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. `onGenerateLinks(Landroid/view/textclassifier/TextClassificationSessionId;Landroid/view/textclassifier/TextLinks$Request;Landroid/service/textclassifier/ITextClassifierCallback;)V` in `Lcom/android/server/textclassifier/TextClassificationManagerService`: This API has a similarity score of 0.73875492811203 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
4. `prepareVpn(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` in `Lcom/android/server/VpnManagerService`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7364661693572998 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
5. `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled(II)Z` in `Lcom/android/server/sensorprivacy/SensorPrivacyService$SensorPrivacyServiceImpl`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7314358949661255 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Considering the functionality of the `setLightStates` method, which involves setting the states of lights on a device, it is likely that this method also requires system or signature-level permissions to access. This is because modifying light states could potentially affect the device's behavior or security.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the functionality of the `setLightStates` method, I conclude that the access control level for this method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
