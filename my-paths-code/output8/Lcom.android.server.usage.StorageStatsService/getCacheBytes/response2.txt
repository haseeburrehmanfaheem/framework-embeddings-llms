To determine the access control level for the `getCacheBytes` method in the `StorageStatsService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - All similar APIs (`queryStatsForUser`, `getCacheSizeBytes`, `queryStatsForPackage`, `queryStatsForUid`, `queryCratesForUid`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permission to access.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code entries for the similar APIs involve interactions with package managers, application info, and storage stats, which are sensitive operations.
   - The presence of `Binder.getCallingUid()` in some paths indicates that the method is checking the UID of the calling process, which is a common practice for enforcing access control.

3. **Method Semantics**:
   - The `getCacheBytes` method retrieves cache size information for a given user and package, which can be considered sensitive data.
   - The method's implementation involves iterating over users, packages, and interacting with the installer service to retrieve storage stats, further indicating that it handles sensitive data.

Given these considerations, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getCacheBytes` method is reasonable. This ensures that only system-level or signature-verified processes can access this sensitive information, aligning with the security practices observed in similar APIs.

**Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision prioritizes the protection of sensitive storage statistics and aligns with the access control levels assigned to similar methods within the Android system.
