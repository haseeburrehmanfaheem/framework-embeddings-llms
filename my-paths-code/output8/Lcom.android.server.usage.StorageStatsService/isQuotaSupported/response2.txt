To determine the access control level for the `isQuotaSupported` method in the `Lcom.android.server.usage.StorageStatsService` class, we should consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `getAllocatableBytes` and `allocateBytes`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

These APIs interact with storage management and quota support, which suggests that they handle sensitive operations related to system resources and security. Given the similarities in functionality (checking for quota support), it's reasonable to infer that `isQuotaSupported` should have a similar or lower access control level compared to its counterparts.

However, since `isQuotaSupported` is essentially a getter method that checks if a quota is supported without modifying any system settings directly, its sensitivity might be considered lower than that of setter methods (like `allocateBytes`) which actively modify resource allocations. 

Despite this, the fact that it's closely related to system-level operations and interacts with components like the installer service suggests that some level of access control is necessary. The method does not seem to pose an immediate risk similar to what a dangerous permission might entail (e.g., accessing personal data without user consent), but its interaction with system services implies a need for restriction beyond `NONE`.

Given these considerations and the fact that reading or checking quota support doesn't inherently modify system states in a risky manner, we could argue for a moderate level of access control. However, because it's part of a system service and deals with internal system functionality (storage stats and installer interactions), assigning it an access control level similar to its peers seems prudent.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the principle that getter methods generally require less stringent access control than setter methods but still need protection due to their interaction with sensitive system components, we assign:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the access control levels of similar APIs (`getAllocatableBytes` and `allocateBytes`) that also deal with system-level storage management and quota support, reflecting a cautious approach to system service interactions.
