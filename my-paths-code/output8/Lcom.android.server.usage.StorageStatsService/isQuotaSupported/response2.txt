To determine the access control level for the `isQuotaSupported` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them eventually lead to a call that checks if a quota is supported. Path 3 directly calls `this.mInstaller.isQuotaSupported(p1)`, which suggests it interacts with an installer or storage manager component.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code provided also points towards interacting with an `mInstaller` object to check for quota support, reinforcing the idea that this method is related to storage management and quotas.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getAllocatableBytes`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to checking or managing storage quotas are considered sensitive and require either system-level permissions or signature-level access.
   - The code snippets from these similar APIs also involve checking for quota support using `StorageStatsManager` or directly through an object (`v4`) that presumably manages storage allocations.

Given the above analysis, the `isQuotaSupported` method appears to be involved in managing or querying storage quotas, which is a sensitive operation related to system resources. Therefore, it should have a similar access control level as the provided similar APIs to ensure that only authorized components can query or manage such information.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the method's involvement in system-sensitive operations (storage quota management) and aligns with the access controls applied to similar APIs.
