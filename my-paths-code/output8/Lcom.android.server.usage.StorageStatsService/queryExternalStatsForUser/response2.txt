To determine the access control level for the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method in the `StorageStatsService` class, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `queryStatsForUser`: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `queryStatsForUid`: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `queryCratesForUid`: SYS_OR_SIG
4. `queryStatsForPackage`: SYS_OR_SIG

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the storage statistics.

The `checkPhoneNumberAccess` API has a lower similarity score and a different access control level (`DANGEROUS`), which is not relevant to the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method.

Based on the similarities with other APIs, it is likely that the `queryExternalStatsForUser` method requires a system or signature-level permission to access the external storage statistics. Therefore, the assigned access control level for this method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
