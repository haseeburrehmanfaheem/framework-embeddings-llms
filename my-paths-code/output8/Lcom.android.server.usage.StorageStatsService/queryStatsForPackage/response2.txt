Based on the provided information, I will analyze the access control level for the `queryStatsForPackage` method.

The method is similar to other APIs in the same class, such as `queryStatsForUid`, `queryCratesForUid`, `queryStatsForUser`, `getCacheBytes`, and `queryExternalStatsForUser`. All of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The `queryStatsForPackage` method interacts with sensitive data, such as package statistics and storage stats, which requires a certain level of access control. The method also uses the `Binder.getCallingUid()` method to get the UID of the calling process, which suggests that it is checking the caller's identity.

Given the similarities with other methods in the same class and the sensitivity of the data being accessed, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `queryStatsForPackage` method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method can only be called by system or signature-protected processes, which provides a reasonable level of protection for the sensitive data being accessed.
