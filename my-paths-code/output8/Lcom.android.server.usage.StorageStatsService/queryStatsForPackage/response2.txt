To determine the access control level for the `queryStatsForPackage` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets for `queryStatsForPackage` show various paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) that the method can take, depending on conditions such as the type of application (system or updated system app), user ID, and package names. The method interacts with storage statistics, retrieves package sizes, and applies augmenters to the storage stats.

The sink code provided involves creating `PackageStats` objects, getting app sizes using `mInstalld.getAppSize`, updating `PackageStats` fields like `codeSize`, `dataSize`, and `cacheSize`, and finally returning a `StorageStats` object after translating or augmenting the package stats.

Given similar APIs:

1. **queryStatsForUid** with an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG**: This method also deals with storage statistics for a specific UID, creating `PackageStats`, getting app sizes, and returning translated `StorageStats`. The similarity in functionality (dealing with storage stats and package information) and the fact that it requires system or signature-level permission to access such sensitive information suggests a similar access control requirement.

2. **queryCratesForUid** with an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG**: Although this method deals with crate metadata and application info, its interaction with user IDs, packages, and the need for protected access to such data aligns with the need for system or signature-level permissions.

Considering these points:

- The `queryStatsForPackage` method handles sensitive storage statistics and package information.
- Similar APIs (`queryStatsForUid` and `queryCratesForUid`) that interact with user and package data have a **SYS_OR_SIG** access control level, indicating the need for system or signature-level permissions to protect access to such sensitive data.

Therefore, based on the functionality of `queryStatsForPackage`, its similarity to other APIs with known access control levels, and the nature of data it handles, the appropriate access control level for this method would also be **SYS_OR_SIG**.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
