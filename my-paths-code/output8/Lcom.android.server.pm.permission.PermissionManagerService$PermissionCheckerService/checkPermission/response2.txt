Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `checkPermission` method.

The `checkPermission` method is similar to other methods that have a high access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are related to permission management, app ops, and attribution sources, which are sensitive operations that require a high level of access control.

The `checkOp` method in the same class has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and it is similar to the `checkPermission` method. The `finishDataDelivery` method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and it is called by the `checkPermission` method.

Additionally, other methods with similar sink code entries, such as `setAutoRevokeExempted` and `sendSigningResult`, also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering these similarities and the sensitive nature of the operations performed by the `checkPermission` method, I conclude that it should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
