To determine the access control level for the `setSelectedRoute` method, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

The provided similar APIs (`requestSetVolume`, `requestUpdateVolume`, `deselectRouteWithRouter2`, and `setDiscoveryRequest`) all have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods seem to be related to media router operations, such as setting volume, updating volume, deselecting routes, and setting discovery requests. They do not appear to involve sensitive operations that would require higher access control levels.

On the other hand, the `getSystemRoutes` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that it involves system-level operations or requires a signature permission to access system routes. However, this method is a getter and does not modify any state, whereas `setSelectedRoute` is a setter that modifies the selected route.

Given that `setSelectedRoute` modifies the state of the media router service and considering the similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE`, it seems reasonable to assign a moderate access control level to this method. However, since setting a route can potentially affect system behavior or user experience, and considering the principle that writing data usually poses a greater security risk than reading it, we should consider a higher access control level.

Among the options provided (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), `NORMAL` seems to be an appropriate choice for the `setSelectedRoute` method. This is because setting a route, while potentially impactful, does not necessarily involve sensitive user data or system-critical operations that would warrant `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.

Therefore, based on the provided information and considering the principles of access control in Android, the final access control level for the `setSelectedRoute` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
