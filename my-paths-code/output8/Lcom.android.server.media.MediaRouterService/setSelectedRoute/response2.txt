Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `setSelectedRoute` method.

The `setSelectedRoute` method has three paths with different depths, and all of them interact with the same sinks, which are related to setting the selected route ID and sending messages to the handler. The sink code snippets show that the method is modifying the `MediaRouterService$ClientRecord.mSelectedRouteId` field and sending messages to the `MediaRouterService$UserRecord.mHandler`.

The similar APIs provided, `requestSetVolume` and `requestUpdateVolume`, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with the same handler and send messages with different parameters.

Considering the similarities between the `setSelectedRoute` method and the provided similar APIs, it can be inferred that the access control level for `setSelectedRoute` should be `NORMAL`. This is because the method is modifying the selected route ID and sending messages to the handler, which are similar operations to those performed by the similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the analysis of the provided information, including the code snippets, sink code, and similar APIs. The `setSelectedRoute` method appears to be performing operations that are similar to those of the provided similar APIs, which have an access control level of `NONE`. However, considering the context and the specific operations performed by the `setSelectedRoute` method, a more appropriate access control level would be `NORMAL`.
