To determine the access control level for the `stopScan` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `stopScan` method has three code paths with different depths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path checks if a manager record exists for the given `IMediaRouter2Manager` instance. If it does, the method returns without performing any further actions.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path calls `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.stopScanLocked(p1)`, which is one of the sink codes.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path directly calls `this.mService2.stopScan(p1)`, which is another sink code.

The sink codes are:
- `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.stopScanLocked(p1);`
- `this.mService2.stopScan(p1);`

Both of these sink codes seem to be related to stopping a scan operation, and they do not appear to pose any significant security risks or require special permissions.

Now, let's look at the similar APIs:

- API Name: `startScan(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)V` with Similarity Score: 0.9583324193954468
  - Access Control Level: NONE
  - Code: `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.startScanLocked(p1);`
- API Name: `startScan(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)V` with Similarity Score: 0.9438300132751465
  - Access Control Level: NONE
  - Code: `this.mService2.startScan(p1);`

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, indicating that they do not require any special permissions or pose significant security risks.

Considering the code paths and sink codes of the `stopScan` method, as well as the similar APIs with their access control levels, it appears that the `stopScan` method does not require any special permissions or pose significant security risks. Therefore, its access control level should be NONE.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
