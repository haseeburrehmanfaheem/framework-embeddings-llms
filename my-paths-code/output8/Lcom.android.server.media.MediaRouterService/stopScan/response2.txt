To determine the access control level for the `stopScan` method in the `MediaRouterService` class, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are:

1. `startScan(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)V` - Access Control Level: NONE
2. `unregisterRouter2(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2;)V` - Access Control Level: NONE
3. `unregisterManager(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)V` - Access Control Level: NONE
4. `registerRouter2(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2;Ljava/lang/String;)V` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
5. `deselectRouteWithRouter2(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2;Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/media/MediaRoute2Info;)V` - Access Control Level: NONE

The `stopScan` method has a high similarity with `startScan`, which has an access control level of NONE. Both methods seem to be related to managing the scan process for media routers, and their similarities in code structure and sink code entries suggest that they might require similar levels of access control.

Given this information, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of NONE to the `stopScan` method, as it is similar to other methods with the same access control level. The fact that `registerRouter2` has a higher access control level (SYS_OR_SIG) does not necessarily imply that `stopScan` should have a higher level, since the security risks associated with registering a router may be different from those associated with stopping a scan.

Therefore, based on the provided information and similarities with other APIs, I would assign an access control level of NONE to the `stopScan` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
