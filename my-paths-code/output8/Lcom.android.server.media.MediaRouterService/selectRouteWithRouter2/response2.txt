Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `selectRouteWithRouter2` method.

The `selectRouteWithRouter2` method is used to select a route with a given router and route information. The method has three paths with different depths, and it interacts with the `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl` class and the `mAllRouterRecords` map.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to be accessed. These APIs are also related to media routing and session management, which is similar to the functionality of the `selectRouteWithRouter2` method.

However, it's worth noting that the `selectRouteWithRouter2` method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`, which suggests that it may be interacting with sensitive data or performing actions that require careful consideration of security implications.

Given the similarities with other APIs and the use of `Binder` methods, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `selectRouteWithRouter2` method. This level indicates that the method requires some basic permissions and restrictions but does not pose a significant security risk.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment takes into account the similarities with other APIs, the use of `Binder` methods, and the potential security implications of the method's functionality. However, it's essential to note that a more detailed analysis of the specific requirements and constraints of the Android system and the media routing functionality may lead to a different access control level assignment.
