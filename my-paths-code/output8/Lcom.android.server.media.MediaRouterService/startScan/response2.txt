To determine the access control level for the `startScan` method in the `MediaRouterService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `startScan` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them eventually lead to either `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.startScanLocked(p1)` or `this.mService2.startScan(p1)`. These sink code entries are similar to those found in other APIs, such as `stopScan`, `unregisterRouter2`, `registerRouter2`, `unregisterManager`, and `registerManager`.

Among the similar APIs, we can observe the following access control levels:

* `stopScan`: NONE
* `unregisterRouter2`: NONE
* `registerRouter2`: SYS_OR_SIG (this is likely due to the registration process requiring system or signature-level permission)
* `unregisterManager`: NONE
* `registerManager`: NONE

The `startScan` method seems to be related to initiating a scan for media routers, which might not require sensitive permissions like registering a router or manager. However, it's essential to consider the potential impact of starting a scan on the system and user data.

Given the similarities with other APIs and their access control levels, we can make an informed decision:

* The `stopScan` method has an access control level of NONE, suggesting that stopping a scan is not considered sensitive.
* The `registerRouter2` method has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that registering a router requires system or signature-level permission. However, starting a scan might not require the same level of permission.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to assign an access control level of NONE to the `startScan` method, as it seems to be a relatively innocuous operation compared to registering a router or manager.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, as well as the potential impact of starting a scan on the system and user data.
