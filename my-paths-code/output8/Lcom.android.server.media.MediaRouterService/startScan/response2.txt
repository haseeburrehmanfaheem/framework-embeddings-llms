To determine the access control level for the `startScan` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the `startScan` method itself.

The two similar APIs provided are both named `stopScan`, with high similarity scores (0.9583324193954468 and 0.9438300132751465), indicating that their functionality and possibly their security requirements are closely related to those of the `startScan` method. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given this information, we can infer a few key points:

1. **Similarity in Functionality**: The high similarity scores suggest that `startScan` and `stopScan` methods share similar operational characteristics or are used in related contexts within the system.

2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs (`stopScan`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that, from a security perspective, these methods do not require special permissions or protections beyond what is normally enforced by the system.

3. **Semantics of startScan**: The method appears to initiate a scan operation related to media routing. The presence of checks (like ensuring the manager is not null) and interactions with service-level components (`MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.startScanLocked(p1);`, `this.mService2.startScan(p1);`) indicate that this method operates within a managed environment, likely with its own set of rules or protocols for handling media routing scans.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the `startScan` method, similar to the `stopScan` methods, does not require elevated permissions or special access controls. The system's design seems to trust the invocation of scan operations (both start and stop) without imposing additional security restrictions beyond the standard checks (like null checks).

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the operational context provided, the access control level for the `startScan` method should be consistent with that of its similar counterparts.

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
