To determine the access control level for the `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided API has three paths with different depths, but all of them seem to be related to retrieving system session information for a specific package. The sink code snippets suggest that this API is involved in building and returning `RoutingSessionInfo` objects, which contain sensitive information about the system's routing sessions.

Comparing this API with the similar ones provided, we can see that they all have a high similarity score (> 0.9) and are related to retrieving system session information. The access control levels for these similar APIs are both `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities in code and functionality, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage` API should have a similar access control level. Since it's dealing with sensitive system information and has similar functionality to the other APIs, which require `SYS_OR_SIG` permission, we can assign the same access control level to this API.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
