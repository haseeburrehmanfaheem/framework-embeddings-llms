Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `selectRouteWithManager` API.

The `selectRouteWithManager` API has a high similarity with other APIs in the same class, such as `selectRouteWithRouter2`, `deselectRouteWithManager`, `deselectRouteWithRouter2`, `transferToRouteWithManager`, and `transferToRouteWithRouter2`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

The sink code entries for these similar APIs also show that they all call methods on the `mService2` object, which suggests that they are all part of a larger media routing system. The `selectRouteWithManager` API follows a similar pattern, calling `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.selectRouteWithManagerLocked` or delegating to `mService2.selectRouteWithManager`.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `selectRouteWithManager` API should have the same access control level as its similar APIs. Therefore, I assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `selectRouteWithManager` API.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
