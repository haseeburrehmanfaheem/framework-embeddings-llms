Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `deselectRouteWithRouter2` API.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to be accessed. These APIs are related to media routing and seem to be part of a system service, which implies that they might be intended for internal use within the Android system.

The `deselectRouteWithRouter2` API appears to be similar in functionality and purpose to these other APIs, as it is also involved in media routing operations. The sink code entries provided do not indicate any sensitive or restricted operations that would require a higher access control level.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the lack of evidence suggesting sensitive operations, I conclude that the `deselectRouteWithRouter2` API should have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
