To determine the access control level for the `setDiscoveryRequestWithRouter2` method in the `MediaRouterService` class, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `registerRouter2`: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `deselectRouteWithRouter2`: NONE
3. `selectRouteWithRouter2`: NONE
4. `transferToRouteWithRouter2`: NONE
5. `releaseSessionWithRouter2`: NONE

All the similar APIs, except for `registerRouter2`, have an access control level of NONE. However, `registerRouter2` has a similarity score of 0.8461 with the target method and is assigned SYS_OR_SIG access control.

The sink code entries for these methods involve interactions with `IBinder` and accessing or modifying router records, which are similar to the operations performed by `setDiscoveryRequestWithRouter2`.

Given that most of the similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, but considering the specific case of `registerRouter2` with SYS_OR_SIG and its relatively high similarity score, we should consider the implications of setting a discovery request.

Setting a discovery request can potentially affect system behavior and media routing decisions. It does not seem to pose as significant a risk as operations that directly modify sensitive data or settings but could still impact how media is routed within the system.

However, since reading (getting) media router preferences might be less sensitive than setting them, and considering the principle that writing data usually poses a greater security risk, we should lean towards caution. The method's functionality does not appear to directly handle sensitive user data or perform actions that would typically require dangerous permissions.

Given these considerations and the fact that most similar methods have NONE access control but acknowledging the potential system impact, the most appropriate access control level for `setDiscoveryRequestWithRouter2` seems to be NORMAL. This choice balances the need to protect system integrity with the method's functionality not directly implicating sensitive user data or dangerous operations.
