Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getSystemSessionInfo` method.

The `getSystemSessionInfo` method is used to retrieve system session information, which may contain sensitive data. The method has three different paths with varying levels of complexity, but all of them ultimately return a `RoutingSessionInfo` object.

Looking at the similar APIs provided, we can see that:

* `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that it requires system or signature-level permission to access.
* `getSystemRoutes` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getSystemSessionInfo` method, I would argue that the `getSystemSessionInfo` method should also require a similar level of access control.

Since the `getSystemSessionInfo` method is a getter method, which is generally considered less sensitive than a setter method, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `getSystemSessionInfo` method is protected with a suitable access control level, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive system session information.
