To determine the access control level for the `getSystemSessionInfo` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The API has three paths with different depths, but all of them seem to be related to retrieving system session information for media routing purposes. The critical parts involve creating a `RoutingSessionInfo$Builder`, setting properties like system session and selected routes, and then building the `RoutingSessionInfo` object.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show how the `RoutingSessionInfo` is constructed and returned. This process involves accessing and manipulating media routing information, which could be sensitive in terms of user privacy and device security.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided with a high similarity score (>0.9), indicating they share significant functionality or purpose with `getSystemSessionInfo`.
   - Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that system or signature-level permissions are required to access these APIs. This implies that the operations performed by these APIs are sensitive and should be restricted to system-level components or applications signed with the platform key.

Given this analysis, we can infer the following:

- The `getSystemSessionInfo` API deals with system-level media routing information.
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require either system-level permissions or are restricted to applications signed with the platform's signature.
- The operations within `getSystemSessionInfo`, such as accessing and manipulating system session information for media routes, could potentially impact device security or user privacy.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of the information handled by this API and the access control levels assigned to similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `getSystemSessionInfo` should also have a restricted access control level to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment ensures that only system-level components or applications with the appropriate permissions (i.e., those signed with the platform key) can access this API, thereby protecting sensitive media routing information and maintaining device security.
