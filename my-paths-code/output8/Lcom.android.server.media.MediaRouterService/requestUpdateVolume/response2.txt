Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `requestUpdateVolume` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `requestUpdateVolume` method has two paths:

1. Path 1 with depth 1: This path checks if `p1` is null, and if so, it sends a message to the handler using `MediaRouterService$UserRecord.mHandler.obtainMessage(7, p3, 0, p2)`. This suggests that the method is interacting with a system service or a sensitive component.
2. Path 2 with depth 0: This path also checks if `p1` is null, and if so, it calls another method `requestUpdateVolumeLocked(p1, p2, p3)`.

The sink code for this method includes two lines:
```java
Message v5 = MediaRouterService$UserRecord.mHandler.obtainMessage(7, p3, 0, p2);
v5.sendToTarget();
```
and
```java
p0.requestUpdateVolumeLocked(p1, p2, p3);
```
The similar APIs provided are:

* `requestSetVolume(Landroid/media/IMediaRouterClient;Ljava/lang/String;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.9983346462249756 and an access control level of NONE. This method sends a message to the handler using `MediaRouterService$UserRecord.mHandler.obtainMessage(6, p3, 0, p2)`.
* `requestSetVolume(Landroid/media/IMediaRouterClient;Ljava/lang/String;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.9513335227966309 and an access control level of NONE. This method calls another method `requestSetVolumeLocked(p1, p2, p3)`.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, it appears that they are all related to media routing and volume control. The fact that they have a similarity score above 0.9 suggests that they share similar functionality and may require similar access control levels.

Given the information provided, it seems that the `requestUpdateVolume` method is interacting with system services or sensitive components, but it does not appear to pose a significant security risk. Therefore, based on the similarities with other APIs and their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of NONE to the `requestUpdateVolume` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
