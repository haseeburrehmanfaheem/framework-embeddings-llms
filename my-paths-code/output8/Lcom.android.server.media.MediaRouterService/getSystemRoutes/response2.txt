Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `getSystemRoutes` API.

The `getSystemRoutes` API has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them seem to be related to retrieving system routes or route information. The sink code snippets also suggest that this API is involved in fetching and returning route-related data.

Looking at the similar APIs provided, we can observe the following:

1. `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage` has a similarity score of 0.8554904460906982 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API seems to be related to retrieving session information for a specific package, which might require system-level or signature-level permissions.
2. `setSelectedRoute` has a similarity score of 0.7903755307197571 and an access control level of `NONE`. This API appears to be involved in setting the selected route for a media router client, which might not require any specific permissions.

Considering the similarities and differences between these APIs, we can infer that the `getSystemRoutes` API is more closely related to `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage` in terms of its functionality and potential permission requirements. However, since `getSystemRoutes` seems to be primarily focused on retrieving route information without modifying any system settings or sensitive data, it might not require the same level of access control as `getSystemSessionInfoForPackage`.

Given this analysis, a reasonable access control level for the `getSystemRoutes` API would be `NORMAL`, as it is likely to require some level of permission or access control to retrieve system routes, but not to the extent of requiring system-level or signature-level permissions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
