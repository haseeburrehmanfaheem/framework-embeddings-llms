Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will analyze the `deselectRouteWithManager` method to determine its access control level.

The `deselectRouteWithManager` method has three paths with different depths, and it interacts with the `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl` class through the `deselectRouteWithManagerLocked` method. The similar APIs provided also interact with the same class, but with different methods.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to be called. However, it's essential to consider the semantics of the `deselectRouteWithManager` method and its potential impact on the system.

The method appears to be related to media routing and session management. It takes an `IMediaRouter2Manager` object, an integer, a string, and a `MediaRoute2Info` object as parameters. The method's purpose is to deselect a route with the given manager, which might involve releasing resources or updating the system's state.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the lack of any apparent sensitive operations, I conclude that the `deselectRouteWithManager` method does not require a high level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `deselectRouteWithManager` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, as well as the method's semantics and potential impact on the system.
