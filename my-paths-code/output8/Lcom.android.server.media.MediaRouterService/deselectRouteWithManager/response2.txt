To determine the access control level for the `deselectRouteWithManager` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The API has three paths with different depths, but all of them eventually lead to either a call to `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.deselectRouteWithManagerLocked` or `this.mService2.deselectRouteWithManager`. These calls are related to managing media routes, which seems to be an internal operation rather than a sensitive user data access or a dangerous operation that could harm the system.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves calls to `MediaRouter2ServiceImpl.deselectRouteWithManagerLocked` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5)`, as well as `this.mService2.deselectRouteWithManager`. These operations are about managing media routes and handling identity restoration, which doesn't directly imply access to sensitive information or performing dangerous actions.

3. **Similar APIs**: The provided similar APIs (`deselectRouteWithRouter2`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that operations related to deselecting routes, whether with a router or a manager, are not considered sensitive or dangerous in terms of access control.

Given this analysis:

- The API does not seem to handle sensitive user data directly.
- It's involved in managing media routes, which is an internal operation.
- Similar APIs have been assigned the `NONE` access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity with other APIs that manage media routes without requiring special access permissions, the most appropriate access control level for the `deselectRouteWithManager` API would be `NONE`.
