To determine the access control level for the `setDiscoveryRequest` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs.

The `setDiscoveryRequest` method modifies the discovery request settings for a media router client. It updates the `mRouteTypes` and `mActiveScan` fields of the `MediaRouterService$ClientRecord` object, which is associated with the client. This modification can potentially affect the behavior of the media router service.

Comparing this method with similar APIs:

* `registerClientGroupId`: This method sets the group ID for a media router client. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission to modify the group ID.
* `setDiscoveryRequestWithRouter2`: This method sets the discovery request for a media router 2 client. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any special permissions to modify the discovery request.
* `setSelectedRoute`: This method sets the selected route for a media router client. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any special permissions to modify the selected route.
* `getSystemRoutes`: This method returns a list of system routes. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission to access the system routes.
* `unregisterClient`: This method unregisters a media router client. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any special permissions to unregister the client.

Based on these comparisons, we can see that the `setDiscoveryRequest` method is similar to `setSelectedRoute` and `unregisterClient`, which do not require special permissions to modify the media router client settings. However, it also modifies the discovery request settings, which could potentially affect the behavior of the media router service.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the `setDiscoveryRequest` method should have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This is because it modifies the discovery request settings, but it does not require system or signature-level permission to do so.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires normal permissions to modify the discovery request settings, but it does not pose a significant security risk.
