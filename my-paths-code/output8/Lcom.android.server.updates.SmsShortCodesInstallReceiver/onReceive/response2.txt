To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and the provided similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels.

The given `onReceive` method has the following characteristics:
- It takes a `Context` and an `Intent` as parameters.
- It creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor, and then starts it.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:
- Both have a similarity score very close to 1 (1.0 and 0.9965633153915405), indicating they are nearly identical in terms of functionality or structure to the method in question.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given this information, we can infer that the `onReceive` method's primary function is to receive a broadcast (as indicated by its name and the parameters it accepts) and then initiate some action based on the received intent. The fact that both very similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` suggests that this type of operation does not require special permissions or pose significant risks that would necessitate higher access control levels like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, considering the similarities in code structure and functionality with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
