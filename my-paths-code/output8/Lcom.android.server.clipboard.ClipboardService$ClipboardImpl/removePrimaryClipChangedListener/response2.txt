Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `removePrimaryClipChangedListener` method.

The method is used to remove a listener for primary clip changes, which is related to clipboard functionality. The similar APIs provided, such as `hasClipboardText`, `getPrimaryClipDescription`, `addPrimaryClipChangedListener`, `getPrimaryClipSource`, and `clearPrimaryClip`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that clipboard-related operations require a system or signature-level permission to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access.

The `removePrimaryClipChangedListener` method does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it only removes a listener and does not modify any sensitive data. However, considering the consistency with other similar APIs and the potential for related security risks, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `removePrimaryClipChangedListener` method is treated consistently with other clipboard-related APIs and requires a system or signature-level permission to maintain security and prevent potential risks.
