To determine the access control level for the `addPrimaryClipChangedListener` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code paths for `addPrimaryClipChangedListener` involve several steps:
1. Getting the intending user ID based on input parameters.
2. Creating a new `ClipboardService$PerUserClipboard` object if it doesn't exist for the user.
3. Registering a listener (`IOnPrimaryClipChangedListener`) with specific parameters.

The sink code snippets highlight interactions with `ClipboardService$PerUserClipboard.primaryClipListeners`, which is crucial for understanding how listeners are managed.

Given similar APIs, specifically `removePrimaryClipChangedListener` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that operations related to managing clipboard listeners (adding or removing) might require a certain level of system or signature protection. This is because these operations could potentially impact the security and privacy of user data on the clipboard.

The similarity in code structure between `addPrimaryClipChangedListener` and `removePrimaryClipChangedListener`, along with their similar purposes (managing listeners for primary clip changes), suggests that they should have comparable access control levels to maintain consistency in protecting system resources and user data.

Therefore, considering the similarities and the potential impact on system security and user privacy, the access control level for `addPrimaryClipChangedListener` should be aligned with that of its similar API counterparts.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" \}}$
