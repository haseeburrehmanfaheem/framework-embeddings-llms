Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `clearPrimaryClip` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the clipboard data. The `clearPrimaryClip` method also interacts with the clipboard data and requires the `clipboardAccessAllowed` check, which suggests that it should have a similar access control level.

Additionally, the method modifies the clipboard data by clearing the primary clip, which is a more sensitive operation than reading the data. Therefore, it's reasonable to assign a higher access control level to this method.

Considering these factors, I will assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `clearPrimaryClip` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
