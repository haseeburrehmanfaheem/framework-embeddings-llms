Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to the `hasClipboardText` method.

The reason for this decision is as follows:

1. The `hasClipboardText` method interacts with sensitive data, specifically the clipboard text, which requires proper access control.
2. The similar APIs provided, such as `getPrimaryClipDescription`, `removePrimaryClipChangedListener`, `clearPrimaryClip`, `hasPrimaryClip`, and `getPrimaryClipSource`, all have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG".
3. These similar APIs also interact with the clipboard data and require proper access control to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
4. The `hasClipboardText` method has a similar code structure and sink code entries as the other APIs, which suggests that it should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I conclude that the `hasClipboardText` method should have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
