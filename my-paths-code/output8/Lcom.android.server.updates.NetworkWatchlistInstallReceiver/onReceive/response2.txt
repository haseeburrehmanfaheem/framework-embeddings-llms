To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and the provided similar APIs along with their access control levels.

The given `onReceive` method has the following characteristics:
- It takes a `Context` and an `Intent` as parameters.
- It creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor, and then starts it.

The sink code provided is essentially the same as the method's body:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0, p2, p1);
v1.start();
```

Looking at the similar APIs:
- Both have a similarity score very close to 1 (1.0 and 0.9965633153915405), indicating they are nearly identical in terms of functionality or structure to the `onReceive` method in question.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given this information, we can infer that:
- The operations performed by `onReceive` (creating and starting a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`) do not seem to pose significant risks or require special permissions based on the provided similar APIs.
- Since both very similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that this type of operation is considered safe or does not require elevated permissions.

Therefore, considering the similarity in code and functionality with other APIs labeled as `NONE`, the most appropriate access control level for the `onReceive` method would also be `NONE`.
