To determine the access control level for the `getProgress` method, let's analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getProgress` method calculates and returns a progress value based on the size of `mDexoptCommands` and `completeSize`. It does not modify any external state or interact with sensitive data directly. The calculation is purely internal to the object's state.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. **isDone()Z**: This method checks if `mDexoptCommands` is empty, which is a simple state check without any modification of external state or access to sensitive information. Its access control level is NONE.

2. **nextDexoptCommand()Ljava/lang/String;**: Although this method modifies the internal state by removing an element from `mDexoptCommands` and increments a counter, it does not directly interact with sensitive data or external systems in a way that would require elevated permissions. Its access control level is also NONE.

Given these comparisons, the `getProgress` method's functionality aligns more closely with `isDone()Z` in terms of not accessing or modifying sensitive information or requiring special permissions to execute its intended function. It simply returns an internal progress calculation based on object state, which does not pose a risk or require specific access control.

Therefore, considering the provided similar APIs and their access control levels, the most appropriate access control level for `getProgress` would be NONE, as it does not interact with sensitive data, modify external states in a dangerous manner, or require system or signature-level permissions to operate.
