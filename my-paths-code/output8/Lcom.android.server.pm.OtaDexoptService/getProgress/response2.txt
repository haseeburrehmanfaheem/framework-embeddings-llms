To determine the access control level for the `getProgress` method in the `Lcom.android.server.pm.OtaDexoptService` class, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getProgress` method calculates and returns the progress of dexopt commands based on the number of commands completed versus the total size (`completeSize`) of commands to be executed. It does not modify any state but merely reports on the current status.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isDone()Z**: This method checks if all dexopt commands have been processed by verifying if `mDexoptCommands` is empty. Its access control level is `NONE`, indicating it's considered safe and does not pose a security risk.
   - **nextDexoptCommand()Ljava/lang/String;**: This method removes and returns the next command from `mDexoptCommands`. It also updates an execution count. Despite modifying state, its access control level is `NONE`.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Since `getProgress` does not modify any state but only reads existing information to calculate progress, it inherently poses less risk compared to methods that alter system or application states.
   - The similar APIs provided (`isDone()` and `nextDexoptCommand()`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to checking the status or executing commands in this context are not considered sensitive.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that `getProgress` is a read-only operation that does not modify system state and considering the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `getProgress` should have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because reading or calculating progress based on existing data does not pose a significant security risk.

**Final Access Control Level**:
