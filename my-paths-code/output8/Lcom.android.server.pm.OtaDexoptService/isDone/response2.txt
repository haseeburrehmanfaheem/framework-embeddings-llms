To determine the access control level for the `isDone` method, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of `isDone` Method:**
   - The `isDone` method checks if `mDexoptCommands` is empty by first checking if it equals 0 and then calling `isEmpty()` on it.
   - This method does not modify any state; it only returns a boolean value indicating whether the commands are done (i.e., if there are no more commands to process).
   - The operation performed by `isDone` does not involve sensitive data or actions that could potentially harm the system or leak sensitive information.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`getProgress()` Method:**
     - This method calculates and returns the progress based on the size of `mDexoptCommands`.
     - It does not modify any state and only provides information about the current progress.
     - Its access control level is `NONE`, indicating that it does not pose a risk to system security or user privacy.
   - **`nextDexoptCommand()` Method:**
     - This method removes and returns the next command from `mDexoptCommands`.
     - Although it modifies state by removing an element from the collection, its access control level is also `NONE`.
     - The reason for this could be that the modification of `mDexoptCommands` is considered an internal operation that does not directly impact system security or user privacy.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and considering the nature of the `isDone` method, which only provides a status check without modifying any sensitive data or performing dangerous operations, it is reasonable to conclude that the `isDone` method also does not pose a risk.
   - Therefore, the appropriate access control level for the `isDone` method should be `NONE`, as it aligns with the behavior and security implications of the similar APIs provided.
