To determine the access control level for the `nextDexoptCommand` method in the `Lcom.android.server.pm.OtaDexoptService` class, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `nextDexoptCommand` method appears to be part of a service that manages the dexopt (dalvik executable optimization) process for Android applications during an over-the-air (OTA) update. It checks if there are any dexopt commands to execute, removes and returns the next command from the list if available, and also considers the device's storage space before executing the command.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves removing a command from `mDexoptCommands`, incrementing an execution counter (`dexoptCommandCountExecuted`), and returning the removed command. This suggests that the method is involved in managing and executing dexopt commands, which could potentially impact system performance or security if not properly controlled.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `isDone()Z` in `Lcom.android.server.pm.OtaDexoptService`: This method checks if all dexopt commands have been executed by verifying if `mDexoptCommands` is empty. Its access control level is `NONE`, indicating that checking the status of the dexopt process does not require specific permissions.
   - `getProgress()F` in `Lcom.android.server.pm.OtaDexoptService`: This method calculates and returns the progress of the dexopt process based on the number of commands executed versus the total. Like `isDone()`, its access control level is `NONE`, suggesting that reading the progress of the dexopt service does not pose a security risk.

4. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Given that both similar APIs (`isDone()` and `getProgress()`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it might initially suggest that `nextDexoptCommand` could also be `NONE`. However, executing dexopt commands can potentially impact system security or performance, especially if an attacker could manipulate the execution of these commands.
   - The method's interaction with system storage and its role in executing potentially sensitive operations (dexopt commands) imply a need for some level of access control. However, since it's part of a system service managing OTA updates and given the nature of the similar APIs provided, the risk seems to be more related to system management rather than direct user data or highly sensitive operations.
   - Considering the principle that if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level, but noting that reading (getter-like operations) in this context does not require high protection, we lean towards a moderate approach for `nextDexoptCommand`.

Given these considerations and the fact that executing dexopt commands involves system-level operations that could impact performance or security if misused, but acknowledging the provided similar APIs have `NONE` access control, a balanced decision would be to assign an access control level that reflects the potential for system impact without over-restricting a necessary system service operation.

Therefore, considering the context and the need to balance between security and functionality, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice acknowledges the method's involvement in system-level operations that could have security implications if not properly managed but also recognizes that it is part of the normal functioning of the OTA dexopt service.
