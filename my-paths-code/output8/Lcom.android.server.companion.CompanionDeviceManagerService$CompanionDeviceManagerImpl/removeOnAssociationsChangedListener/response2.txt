To determine the access control level for the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method, we need to analyze the provided information, including the code snippets of the method itself and its similar APIs along with their assigned access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - The method has three paths with different permission checks:
     - Path 1: `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerCanManageCompanionDevice(v7, "removeOnAssociationsChangedListener");`
     - Path 2: `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerCanInteractWithUserId(v1, p2);`
     - Path 3: Both `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerIsSystemOrCanInteractWithUserId(v1, p2);` and `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerCanManageCompanionDevice(v3, "removeOnAssociationsChangedListener");`

   These checks indicate that the method is sensitive to the caller's identity and permissions, suggesting a need for access control.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **addOnAssociationsChangedListener**: Has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that adding a listener requires system or signature-level permission, which implies a high level of trust.
   - **notifyDeviceDisappeared**: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it's sensitive and likely requires system-level permissions to perform its action.
   - **registerCallback** and **unregisterCallback** in `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$BinderService`: Have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting these operations are less restricted. However, their similarity scores are lower compared to the other APIs listed, making them less relevant for determining the access control level of `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener`.
   - **unregisterDevicePresenceListenerService**: Has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves unregistering a service related to device presence, which is a sensitive operation.

Given this analysis:
- The method's paths involve checks that enforce the caller can manage companion devices or interact with a specific user ID, indicating sensitivity.
- Similar APIs that are closely related (high similarity scores) and perform operations on listeners or device associations have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, suggesting these operations require high trust levels.

Considering the principles of access control in Android:
- If a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction.
- However, since this is a removal operation (akin to a setter in terms of modifying state), and given its similarity to other restricted operations, it should have an equal or higher access control level than less sensitive operations.

**Conclusion**: Given the sensitivity of the operation, the checks involved, and the comparison with similar APIs, the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method should have a high level of access control. Therefore, the most appropriate access control level for this API is `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the restrictions placed on similar operations that modify sensitive device associations or listener registrations.
