To assign an access control level to the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs.

The `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path checks if the caller can manage companion devices using `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerCanManageCompanionDevice`.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path checks if the caller can interact with the user ID using `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerCanInteractWithUserId`.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path checks both if the caller is system or can interact with the user ID using `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerIsSystemOrCanInteractWithUserId` and if the caller can manage companion devices using `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerCanManageCompanionDevice`.

The similar APIs provided are:

* `addOnAssociationsChangedListener`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8479343056678772 and 0.8197379112243652, and both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code for these APIs registers a listener using `RemoteCallbackList.register`.

Comparing the code paths of `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` with the similar APIs, we can see that:

* Path 1 and Path 3 require the caller to have permission to manage companion devices, which is similar to the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
* Path 2 requires the caller to be able to interact with the user ID, which is a less restrictive permission than managing companion devices.

However, considering all paths and the similarity with `addOnAssociationsChangedListener`, it seems that the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` method should have an access control level that ensures the caller has sufficient permissions to manage companion devices or interact with the user ID.

Given this analysis, the final access control level for the `removeOnAssociationsChangedListener` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level aligns with the similar APIs and ensures that the caller has the necessary permissions to remove a listener for associations changed events.
