Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `canPairWithoutPrompt` API.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs are related to managing associations, registering and unregistering device presence listener services, getting associations, and checking notification access.

The `canPairWithoutPrompt` API is also related to managing associations and pairing devices without prompts. It interacts with the same sinks as the similar APIs, such as `AssociationStoreImpl.getAssociationsByAddress` and `AssociationInfo.getTimeApprovedMs`.

Considering the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I will assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `canPairWithoutPrompt` API. This is because the API is likely to require system or signature-level permissions to access and manage associations, similar to the other APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
