To determine the access control level for the `canPairWithoutPrompt` method, let's analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Path 1 involves checking associations based on a MAC address and then filtering these associations using a lambda function that considers package name and user ID. It checks if an association exists within a certain time frame.
   - Path 2 directly finds an association by address using `AssociationStoreImpl.getAssociationsByAddress` and filters it with a lambda considering package name and user ID, similar to Path 1 but more straightforward.
   - Path 3 is the most direct, getting associations for a package with an address from `CompanionDeviceManagerService`.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `legacyDisassociate` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It checks if the caller can manage associations for a package using `PermissionsUtils.checkCallerCanManageAssociationsForPackage`, indicating that system or signature-level permission is required.
   - The `registerDevicePresenceListenerService` method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It enforces that the caller is either the system or has a specific signature permission via `PermissionsUtils.enforceCallerIsSystemOr`, before proceeding with association updates.

3. **Comparison and Decision**:
   - Both similar APIs require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, indicating they deal with sensitive operations (disassociating devices and registering services) that should be restricted to system-level or apps with specific signature permissions.
   - The `canPairWithoutPrompt` method, while not directly performing actions like disassociation or registration, does involve checking the existence of associations based on package names and user IDs. This implies it's dealing with sensitive information about device pairings and their approval status.
   - However, unlike the similar APIs provided, `canPairWithoutPrompt` doesn't explicitly enforce system or signature-level permissions in its code paths. It focuses on determining whether a pairing can occur without prompting based on existing associations and time frames.

Given these observations and considering the method's purpose is to determine eligibility for pairing without user interaction (which could be sensitive but does not directly modify system settings like the similar APIs), one might initially consider it as less restrictive than `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, since it deals with device association information which can be considered sensitive, and given the context of similar APIs requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access for operations that are somewhat related (though more invasive), a cautious approach would be to align its access control with these similar operations.

Thus, considering the sensitivity of device pairing information and the need to protect against unauthorized access or misuse, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems prudent. This ensures that only system-level components or apps with specific, verified permissions can query such sensitive information about device pairings.
