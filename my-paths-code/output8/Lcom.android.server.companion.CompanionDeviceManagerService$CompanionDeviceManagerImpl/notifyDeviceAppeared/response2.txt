To determine the access control level for the `notifyDeviceAppeared` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show that `notifyDeviceAppeared` interacts with sensitive data, such as device associations and presence monitoring. The method updates the last connected time of an association and notifies listeners about changes in device presence.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `registerDevicePresenceListenerService`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8984376192092896 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also interacts with the association store and updates associations.
2. `notifyDeviceDisappeared`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8603838682174683 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves an association by ID and sanitizes it with caller checks.

Given the similarities in code structure and interaction with sensitive data, it is reasonable to conclude that `notifyDeviceAppeared` should have a similar access control level to the compared APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the final access control level for the `notifyDeviceAppeared` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permissions to execute, ensuring that only authorized components can interact with sensitive device association and presence data.
