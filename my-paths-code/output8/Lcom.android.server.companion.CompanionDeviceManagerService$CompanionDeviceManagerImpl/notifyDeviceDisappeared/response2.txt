Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method is used to notify the system that a device has disappeared. The method checks if the caller has permission to manage associations for the package and user ID associated with the device. If the caller has permission, it removes the device from the list of reported self-managed devices and notifies the callback about the device disappearance.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs are related to disassociating devices, registering device presence listeners, and creating virtual devices, which are all sensitive operations that require elevated permissions.

Considering the similarities between the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method and the other APIs, it is likely that this method also requires system or signature-level permissions to access. This is because notifying a device disappearance can potentially impact the system's behavior and security, and therefore, it should be restricted to authorized callers.

In addition, the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method does not seem to have any specific requirements for normal or dangerous access control levels, as it does not involve accessing sensitive user data or performing actions that could potentially harm the system.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and the semantics of the `notifyDeviceDisappeared` method, I conclude that the appropriate access control level for this method is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
