Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that follow any of the positive rules, and considering this is a small API, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink.

Here's the JSON output:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "public void dispatchMessage(int p1, int p2, byte[] p3){",
      "return;"
    ]
  ]
}
```
