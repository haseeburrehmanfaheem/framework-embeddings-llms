To determine the access control level for the `getAccountsByFeatures` method in the `AccountManagerService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `getAccountsByFeatures` method is used to retrieve accounts that match specific features. The method has three different paths with varying levels of complexity, but all paths involve interacting with account data and authenticators.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs are also related to account management and interact with sensitive data.

Based on the similarities between these APIs and the `getAccountsByFeatures` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getAccountsByFeatures` method should have a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
