Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `peekAuthToken` method.

The `peekAuthToken` method is used to retrieve an authentication token for a given account and auth token type. The method has three different paths with varying levels of complexity and security checks.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs are related to account management, such as getting auth tokens, setting auth tokens, getting accounts and visibility for a package, copying an account to a user, and updating credentials.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `peekAuthToken` method, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `peekAuthToken`. The method is reading sensitive data (auth tokens) from the database, which requires a certain level of security and permission.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similar APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `peekAuthToken` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level permissions can access the `peekAuthToken` method, providing a reasonable level of security for the sensitive data being retrieved.
