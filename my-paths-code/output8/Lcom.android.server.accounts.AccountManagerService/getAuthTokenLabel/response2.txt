Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to the `getAuthTokenLabel` method.

The reason for this decision is as follows:

1. The `getAuthTokenLabel` method has a high similarity (above 0.95) with other methods (`updateCredentials`, `getAuthToken`, `copyAccountToUser`, `isCredentialsUpdateSuggested`, and `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures`) that have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG". This suggests that the `getAuthTokenLabel` method is likely to require a similar level of access control.

2. The sink code entries for the `getAuthTokenLabel` method involve interactions with sensitive data, such as account information and authenticator caches, which are also present in the other methods with "SYS_OR_SIG" access control levels.

3. The `getAuthTokenLabel` method does not appear to have any characteristics that would suggest a lower access control level, such as "NONE" or "NORMAL".

Therefore, based on the similarity with other methods and the sensitive nature of the data involved, I conclude that the `getAuthTokenLabel` method should have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
