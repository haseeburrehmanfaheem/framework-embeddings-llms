To determine the access control level for the `invalidateAuthToken` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `invalidateAuthToken` method is used to invalidate an authentication token associated with a specific account type and auth token. The method performs several operations, including:

1. Checking if the account type and auth token are not null.
2. Retrieving the user ID and clearing the calling identity.
3. Deleting the auth token from the database.
4. Updating the auth token cache.

The similar APIs provided are `setAuthToken` and `setPassword`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also perform operations related to account management, such as saving an auth token to the database or updating an account password.

Based on the similarity in functionality and the fact that all three methods interact with sensitive account data, it is reasonable to conclude that the `invalidateAuthToken` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `invalidateAuthToken` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permission to execute, ensuring that only authorized components can invalidate authentication tokens and maintain account security.
