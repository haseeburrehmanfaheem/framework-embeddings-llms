Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to the `invalidateAuthToken` method.

The reason for this decision is as follows:

* The `setAuthToken`, `setPassword`, `peekAuthToken`, `getAuthTokenLabel`, and `updateCredentials` methods all have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG", indicating that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.
* These methods are similar to the `invalidateAuthToken` method in terms of their functionality, as they all interact with account data and authentication tokens.
* The `invalidateAuthToken` method also interacts with sensitive data, such as authentication tokens, and performs operations that could potentially impact the security of the system.
* Given the similarities between these methods and the potential security implications of the `invalidateAuthToken` method, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to this method as well.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
