Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `removeAccountExplicitly` method.

The `removeAccountExplicitly` method is used to remove an account from the system. This operation requires careful consideration of security and permissions, as it can potentially compromise user data or system integrity.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `accountAuthenticated`: has a similarity score of 0.922 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `getAccountsByFeatures`: has a similarity score of 0.874 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `setUserData`: has a similarity score of 0.872 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `getPackagesAndVisibilityForAccount`: has a similarity score of 0.869 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `getAccountsByTypeForPackage`: has a similarity score of 0.867 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Considering the semantics of the `removeAccountExplicitly` method, it is likely that this method also requires a high level of permission to execute. Removing an account can potentially compromise user data or system integrity, so it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to this method.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I assign the following access control level to the `removeAccountExplicitly` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level permissions can execute this method, providing a reasonable level of security and protection for user data and system integrity.
