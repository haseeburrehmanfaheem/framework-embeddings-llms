To determine the access control level for the `removeAccountExplicitly` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `removeAccountExplicitly` method involves several steps:

1.  It checks if the account is managed by the caller.
2.  If not, it retrieves the user accounts for the caller and finds the account ID.
3.  It logs a record of the account removal action.
4.  Finally, it removes the account internally.

The similar APIs provided are `accountAuthenticated` and `getAccountsByFeatures`, both with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with account management and user accounts, but they have different purposes:

*   `accountAuthenticated` updates the last authenticated time for an account.
*   `getAccountsByFeatures` retrieves accounts based on specific features.

Considering the similarities in code structure and the interaction with account management, we can infer that the `removeAccountExplicitly` method requires a similar level of access control. However, since it involves removing an account, which is a more sensitive operation than updating authentication time or retrieving accounts, it's reasonable to assign a more restrictive access control level.

Given the options:

*   `NONE`: No access control, which is not suitable for account management operations.
*   `NORMAL`: Standard access control, which may not be sufficient for sensitive operations like account removal.
*   `DANGEROUS`: Higher access control level, indicating potential risks or sensitive data involvement.
*   `SYS_OR_SIG`: System or signature-level access control, typically required for system-level operations or those that involve sensitive data.

Based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `removeAccountExplicitly` method would be `DANGEROUS`, as it involves removing an account, which is a sensitive operation.

Here's the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "DANGEROUS"
}
```

This assignment reflects the method's potential impact on user data and system security, ensuring that only authorized entities can perform such actions.
