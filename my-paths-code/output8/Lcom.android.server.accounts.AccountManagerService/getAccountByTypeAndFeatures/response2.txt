Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures` method appears to be related to account management and authentication. It interacts with various components, such as `AccountManagerService`, `IAccountManagerResponse`, and `UserAccounts`. The method's code snippets show that it performs operations like getting accounts by type and features, filtering shared accounts, and resolving account visibility.

The similar APIs provided, `getAccountsByFeatures` and `getAuthTokenLabel`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also seem to be related to account management and authentication. They interact with similar components, such as `AccountManagerService` and `AuthenticatorDescription`.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures` method, it is likely that they require a similar level of access control. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that these APIs are system- or signature-protected, meaning they can only be accessed by system-level components or components with a specific signature.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
