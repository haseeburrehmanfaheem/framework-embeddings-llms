To determine the access control level for the `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are:

1. `getAccountsByFeatures`: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `getAuthTokenLabel`: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `updateCredentials`: SYS_OR_SIG
4. `getAccountsAndVisibilityForPackage`: SYS_OR_SIG
5. `hasFeatures`: SYS_OR_SIG

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

The `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures` method is used to retrieve accounts by type and features, which involves accessing sensitive account information. Given its similarity with the other APIs and the sensitivity of the data it handles, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `getAccountByTypeAndFeatures` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment ensures that only system or signature-level authorized components can access this method, protecting sensitive account data from unauthorized access.
