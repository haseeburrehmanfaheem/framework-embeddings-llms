Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, we can analyze the `getPreviousName` method in the `AccountManagerService` class.

The `getPreviousName` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve interacting with the account database and retrieving previous names for a given account. The sink code entries for this method include database queries, cache operations, and identity management.

Comparing the `getPreviousName` method with the similar APIs provided, we can observe that:

* `accountAuthenticated`, `copyAccountToUser`, `setUserData`, `setPassword`, and `getAccountVisibility` all have a similarity score above 0.75, indicating that they share common characteristics and functionality with `getPreviousName`.
* All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Considering the similarities between `getPreviousName` and the other APIs, as well as the sensitive nature of account data and database operations, it is reasonable to conclude that `getPreviousName` should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getPreviousName` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
