Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `returnResults` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `returnResults` method is part of the `CloudSearchManagerService$CloudSearchManagerStub` class and has three different paths with varying depths. The method creates a lambda object `CloudSearchManagerService$CloudSearchManagerStub$$ExternalSyntheticLambda1` and calls its `accept` method, which is also present in the sink code.

The similar APIs provided have high similarity scores (above 0.88) and are all part of the `SmartspaceManagerService$SmartspaceManagerStub` class or the same class as the `returnResults` method (`CloudSearchManagerService$CloudSearchManagerStub`). These APIs also create lambda objects and call their `accept` methods, similar to the `returnResults` method.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. This is likely due to the sensitive nature of the data being handled by these APIs, such as smartspace events and search requests.

Given the similarities between the `returnResults` method and the other APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `returnResults` method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access. Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `returnResults` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
