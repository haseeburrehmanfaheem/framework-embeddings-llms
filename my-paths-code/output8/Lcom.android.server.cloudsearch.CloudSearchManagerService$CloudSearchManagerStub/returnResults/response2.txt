To determine the access control level for the `returnResults` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `returnResults` API has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path involves checking if a service is temporary using `ServiceNameResolver` and then verifying if the caller is recents using `ActivityTaskManagerInternal`. If the conditions are met, it clears the calling identity and executes a lambda function.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path is similar to Path 1 but uses different methods to access internal variables.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path simply runs a lambda function for a specific user.

The sink code for `returnResults` involves creating a lambda function and executing its `accept` method.

Comparing `returnResults` with the similar APIs:

* `search(Landroid/app/cloudsearch/SearchRequest;Landroid/app/cloudsearch/ICloudSearchManagerCallback;)V`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It creates a lambda function and sets the caller package name. The similarity score is 0.960667610168457, indicating a high degree of similarity with `returnResults`.
* `notifySmartspaceEvent(Landroid/app/smartspace/SmartspaceSessionId;Landroid/app/smartspace/SmartspaceTargetEvent;)V`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It creates a lambda function and executes its `accept` method, similar to the sink code in `returnResults`. The similarity score is 0.8929972648620605, indicating a moderate degree of similarity.

Based on the analysis, it appears that `returnResults` shares similarities with APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The lambda function creation and execution pattern in `returnResults` is similar to those found in the similar APIs.

Therefore, considering the code paths, sink code, and similarities with other APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `returnResults` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the API requires system or signature-level permissions to execute, which is consistent with the patterns observed in similar APIs.
