To determine the access control level for the `getInstallerForPackage` method, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs. 

The `getInstallerForPackage` method is used to retrieve the installer package name for a given package. This operation involves accessing package information, which is generally considered to be a relatively safe operation.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `getTargetSdkVersionForPackage`: This method has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any specific permissions or restrictions.
2. `getNamesForUids`: This method also has an access control level of `NONE`.
3. `getAllPackages`: Similarly, this method has an access control level of `NONE`.
4. `prepare`: This method is part of the `OtaDexoptService` class and has an access control level of `NONE`.
5. `getVersionCodeForPackage`: This method has an access control level of `NONE`.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access package information.

Considering the semantics of the `getInstallerForPackage` method and the access control levels of the similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also does not require any specific permissions or restrictions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the access control level for the `getInstallerForPackage` method should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This conclusion is supported by the fact that accessing package information, such as the installer package name, is generally considered a relatively safe operation that does not pose significant security risks.
