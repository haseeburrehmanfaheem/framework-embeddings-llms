Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `isPackageDebuggable` method.

The `isPackageDebuggable` method is used to determine if a package is debuggable. This method does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it only returns a boolean value indicating whether the package is debuggable or not.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `isAudioPlaybackCaptureAllowed`: This method has an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that it does not require any special permissions to access.
* `getInstallerForPackage`: This method also has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it is a relatively safe method to call.
* `getTargetSdkVersionForPackage`: Similar to the previous two methods, this method has an access control level of `NONE`.
* `getNamesForUids`: Again, this method has an access control level of `NONE`.

The only method with a different access control level is `provideContextImage`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, this method seems to be unrelated to the `isPackageDebuggable` method in terms of functionality and purpose.

Considering the similarities between the `isPackageDebuggable` method and the other methods with an access control level of `NONE`, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `isPackageDebuggable` method.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the `isPackageDebuggable` method does not seem to pose a significant security risk and is similar to other methods with an access control level of `NONE`.
