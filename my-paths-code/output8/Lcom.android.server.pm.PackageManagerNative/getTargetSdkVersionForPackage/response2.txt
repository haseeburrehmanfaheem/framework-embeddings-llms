Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `getTargetSdkVersionForPackage` API.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access. These APIs seem to be related to retrieving information about packages, such as installers, signing certificates, package names, and version codes.

The `getTargetSdkVersionForPackage` API also appears to be related to retrieving information about a package, specifically the target SDK version. The sink code entries provided show that this API interacts with the same sinks as the similar APIs, such as `Computer` and `PackageManagerService$Snapshot`.

Given the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `getTargetSdkVersionForPackage` API does not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access. Therefore, the assigned access control level for this API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the similar APIs have access control levels of `NONE`, and the `getTargetSdkVersionForPackage` API seems to be related to retrieving information about a package, which is a relatively low-risk operation. Additionally, the sink code entries provided do not indicate any sensitive operations or data being accessed.
