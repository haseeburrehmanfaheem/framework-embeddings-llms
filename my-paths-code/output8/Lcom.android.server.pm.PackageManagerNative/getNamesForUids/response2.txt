Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "NONE" to the `getNamesForUids` method.

The reason for this decision is as follows:

1. The similar APIs provided, such as `getInstallerForPackage`, `getAllPackages`, `getTargetSdkVersionForPackage`, and `hasSha256SigningCertificate`, all have an access control level of "NONE". This suggests that the `getNamesForUids` method, which is similar in functionality and purpose, should also have a similar access control level.

2. The `prepare` method in the `OtaDexoptService` class, although not directly related to package management, also has an access control level of "NONE". This further supports the decision to assign an access control level of "NONE" to the `getNamesForUids` method.

3. The semantics of the `getNamesForUids` method, which retrieves a list of package names for a given set of UIDs, does not seem to pose a significant security risk. This is because reading data, in this case, package names, is generally less sensitive than modifying it.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "NONE" to the `getNamesForUids` method.

  "access_control_level": "NONE"
