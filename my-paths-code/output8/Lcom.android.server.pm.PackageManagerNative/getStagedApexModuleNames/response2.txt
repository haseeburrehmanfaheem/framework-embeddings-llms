Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getStagedApexModuleNames` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getStagedApexModuleNames` method appears to be retrieving a list of staged APEX module names from the `StagingManager`. The method has three different paths with varying levels of complexity, but all ultimately return a list of module names.

The similar API, `getStagedApexInfo`, has a similarity score ranging from 0.838 to 0.936, indicating a significant resemblance in code structure and functionality. This API has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that it does not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access the staged APEX information.

Considering the similarities between the two APIs and the fact that `getStagedApexInfo` has an access control level of `NONE`, I would argue that `getStagedApexModuleNames` should also have a relatively low access control level. Since the method is only retrieving a list of module names, which is likely not sensitive information, I believe that an access control level of `NONE` is appropriate.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarities with the `getStagedApexInfo` API and the relatively low sensitivity of the information being retrieved by `getStagedApexModuleNames`.
