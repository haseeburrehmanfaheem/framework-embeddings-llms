Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `getVersionCodeForPackage` API.

The similar APIs have access control levels of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access the package information. The `getVersionCodeForPackage` API also retrieves package information, specifically the version code, and does not seem to pose any significant security risks.

Considering the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I will assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getVersionCodeForPackage` API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the API is retrieving publicly available information (version code) and does not seem to pose any significant security risks. Additionally, the similar APIs with high similarity scores also have an access control level of `NONE`, which supports this decision.
