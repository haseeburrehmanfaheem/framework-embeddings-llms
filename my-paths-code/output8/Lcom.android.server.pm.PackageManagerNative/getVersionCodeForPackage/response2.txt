To determine the access control level for the `getVersionCodeForPackage` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) but all essentially boil down to retrieving package information using a `Computer` or `PackageManagerService$Snapshot` object and then returning the version code of the specified package.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink codes provided are directly related to getting package info and then extracting the version code from it, which is central to what `getVersionCodeForPackage` does.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getAllPackages()`: This method returns a list of all packages. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it doesn't pose significant risks or require special permissions.
   - `getInstallerForPackage(String)`: Similar to the first, this method retrieves the installer package name for a given package and also has an access control level of `NONE`.

Given these points:

- The `getVersionCodeForPackage` method is primarily involved in retrieving information about installed packages, which does not inherently pose significant security risks or require dangerous permissions.
- Both similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to querying package information are considered safe and do not require elevated permissions.

Therefore, based on the semantics of the API, its interactions with sinks, and the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `getVersionCodeForPackage` should also have an access control level of `NONE`.
