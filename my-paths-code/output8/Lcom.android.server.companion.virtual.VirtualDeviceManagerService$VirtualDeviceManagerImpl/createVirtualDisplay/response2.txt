To determine the access control level for the `createVirtualDisplay` method in the `Lcom.android.server.companion.virtual.VirtualDeviceManagerService$VirtualDeviceManagerImpl` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `createVirtualDisplay` method is responsible for creating a virtual display, which involves interacting with sensitive system components such as the display manager and input manager. The method also handles user data and permissions, which requires careful consideration of access control.

The similar API provided, `createVirtualDisplay(Landroid/hardware/display/VirtualDisplayConfig;Landroid/hardware/display/IVirtualDisplayCallback;Landroid/media/projection/IMediaProjection;Ljava/lang/String;)I` in the `Lcom.android.server.display.DisplayManagerService$BinderService` class, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that creating a virtual display is a sensitive operation that requires system or signature-level permission.

Considering the similarities between the two APIs and the sensitive nature of the operation, it is reasonable to conclude that the `createVirtualDisplay` method in the `Lcom.android.server.companion.virtual.VirtualDeviceManagerService$VirtualDeviceManagerImpl` class should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level components can create virtual displays, which helps to prevent unauthorized access and potential security risks.
