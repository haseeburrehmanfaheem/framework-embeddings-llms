Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `releaseFrontend` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs seem to be related to managing resources, such as releasing locks, LNBS, and CAS sessions, which are critical operations that require elevated permissions.

The `releaseFrontend` method appears to be similar in nature, as it releases a frontend resource and performs various checks, such as validating the resource handle and checking client existence. Given its similarity to the other APIs, it is likely that this method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `releaseFrontend` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
