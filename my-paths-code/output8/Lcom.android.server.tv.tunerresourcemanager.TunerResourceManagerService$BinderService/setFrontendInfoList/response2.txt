Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `setFrontendInfoList` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs seem to be related to managing tuner resources, such as frontends and descramblers, and modifying their configurations.

The `setFrontendInfoList` method appears to be modifying the frontend resources by adding or removing entries from the `mFrontendResources` map. This operation seems to be similar in nature to the other APIs provided, which also modify tuner resource configurations.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, I would assign a similar access control level to the `setFrontendInfoList` method.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the assumption that modifying frontend resources requires system or signature-level permissions, similar to the other APIs provided.
