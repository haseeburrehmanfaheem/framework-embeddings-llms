To determine the access control level for the `updateCasInfo` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `updateCasInfo` method appears to be updating CAS (Conditional Access System) resources based on the input parameters `p1` and `p2`. It interacts with `CasResource` and `CiCamResource` objects, which are also present in the similar APIs.

The similar APIs, `requestCasSession` and `requestCiCam`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access the tuner resource manager service.

Comparing the code of `updateCasInfo` with the similar APIs, we can see that it performs similar operations, such as:

* Retrieving CAS resources using `TunerResourceManagerService.getCasResource(p1)`
* Creating new CAS resources using `CasResource$Builder`
* Updating the maximum session number using `CasResource$Builder.maxSessionNum(p2)`
* Adding new CAS resources to the tuner resource manager service using `TunerResourceManagerService.addCasResource(v18)`

These operations suggest that the `updateCasInfo` method requires similar access control levels as the similar APIs.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `updateCasInfo` method, as it appears to require system or signature-level permission to access and modify the tuner resource manager service.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
