Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `setMaxNumberOfFrontends` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setMaxNumberOfFrontends` method appears to be modifying the `mFrontendMaxUsableNums` map, which suggests that it is writing data. As mentioned in the guidelines, writing data usually poses a greater security risk than reading data. Therefore, we should consider assigning a higher access control level to this method.

The similar API `getMaxNumberOfFrontends` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires a system or signature-level permission to access. Since the `setMaxNumberOfFrontends` method is modifying data related to the same resource (frontends), it is likely that it should have at least the same level of access control as the getter method.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the `setMaxNumberOfFrontends` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is modifying sensitive data and requires a higher level of protection.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
