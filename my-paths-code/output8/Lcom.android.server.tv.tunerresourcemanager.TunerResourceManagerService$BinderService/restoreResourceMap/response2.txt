Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `restoreResourceMap` method.

The `restoreResourceMap` method is used to restore the resource map from a backup. This operation involves modifying sensitive data related to tuner resources, which could potentially impact the functionality and security of the TV tuner resource manager service.

Similar APIs, such as `clearResourceMap`, `storeResourceMap`, and `setFrontendInfoList`, have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with sensitive data and perform operations that could impact the service's functionality and security.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the potential risks associated with modifying tuner resource data, I conclude that the `restoreResourceMap` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that only system or signature-privileged applications can call this method, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security vulnerabilities.
