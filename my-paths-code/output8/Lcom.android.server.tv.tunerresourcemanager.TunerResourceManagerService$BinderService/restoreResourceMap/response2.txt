To determine the access control level for the `restoreResourceMap` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths. Path 1 directly interacts with `TunerResourceManagerService` methods to replace frontend resources and counts when the input parameter `p1` is 0. Path 2 calls `restoreResourceMapInternal` on `this.this$0`, which suggests an internal implementation detail but does not directly reveal its access control implications without knowing what `restoreResourceMapInternal` does.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves replacing frontend resources and counts, similar to the operations in the provided similar APIs (`clearResourceMap` and `storeResourceMap`). These operations seem critical for managing tuner resources, suggesting they might require specific permissions or access controls.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `clearResourceMap(I)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It resets resource maps by replacing them with default values (0 in this case), which is a significant operation that could impact system functionality.
   - `storeResourceMap(I)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It stores the current state of resources into backup variables, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and recoverability.

Given these points:

- The operations performed by `restoreResourceMap` are similar in nature to those of `clearResourceMap` and `storeResourceMap`, involving critical system resource management.
- These operations could potentially impact system stability or functionality if not properly controlled.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions, which are more restrictive than normal permissions.

Considering the above analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that `restoreResourceMap` should also have a similar access control level due to its involvement in critical resource management tasks. Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege and ensures that such sensitive operations are protected appropriately, requiring either system-level or signature-level permissions to execute.
