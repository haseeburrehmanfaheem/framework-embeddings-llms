To determine the access control level for the `releaseLock` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `releaseLock` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path calls `TunerResourceManagerService.lockForTunerApiLock(p1, 500, "releaseLockInternal()")`, which is similar to the `acquireLock` API with a similarity score of 0.9443024396896362. The `acquireLock` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path calls `this.this$0.releaseLockInternal(p1, 500, 0, 0)`, which is similar to the `acquireLock` API with a similarity score of 0.9028707146644592. The `acquireLock` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path calls `TunerResourceManagerService.-$$Nest$mreleaseLockInternal(this.this$0, p1, 500, 0, 0)`, which is also similar to the `acquireLock` API.

All three paths of the `releaseLock` method are similar to the `acquireLock` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Therefore, based on the similarity in code and functionality, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to the `releaseLock` method.

The final access control level for the `releaseLock` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
