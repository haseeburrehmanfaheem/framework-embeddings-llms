Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getMaxNumberOfFrontends` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getMaxNumberOfFrontends` method appears to be a getter method that retrieves the maximum number of frontends for a given input. The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately retrieve data from internal maps or call another internal method.

The similar APIs provided are `setMaxNumberOfFrontends(II)Z` and `storeResourceMap(I)V`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods seem to be related to setting or storing resource maps, which could potentially modify sensitive data.

Given that the `getMaxNumberOfFrontends` method is a getter method, it is likely that it does not require the same level of access control as the similar APIs. However, since the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that the data being retrieved by `getMaxNumberOfFrontends` may still be sensitive or internal to the system.

Considering these factors, a reasonable access control level for the `getMaxNumberOfFrontends` method would be `NORMAL`. This level indicates that the method can be accessed by normal applications, but it may still require some basic permissions or checks to ensure that the data is not being misused.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
