To determine the access control level for the `hasUnusedFrontend` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `requestFrontend`: This API has a similarity of 0.9680081009864807 with `hasUnusedFrontend` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The high similarity suggests that both methods interact with similar data structures (e.g., `mFrontendResources`) in a comparable manner.
   - `setFrontendInfoList`: Although less similar (0.7224128246307373), this API also interacts with `mFrontendResources` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method modifies the frontend resources, which typically requires higher security restrictions compared to reading or checking their status.

2. **Semantics of `hasUnusedFrontend`**:
   - The method checks if there are unused frontends of a specific type. It iterates over the frontend resources and checks their types and usage status.
   - Unlike `setFrontendInfoList`, which modifies the frontend resources, `hasUnusedFrontend` only reads or checks the status of these resources.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, reading data (as in the case of `hasUnusedFrontend`) is considered less sensitive than modifying it (as with `setFrontendInfoList` and `requestFrontend`). However, the access control level should also consider the sensitivity of the data being accessed and the potential impact of exposing this information.
   - If a getter method (like `hasUnusedFrontend`) is protected at a certain level, the corresponding setter methods (if any) should be secured with an equal or higher access control level due to the greater security risk associated with writing data.

Given these considerations:

- The high similarity between `hasUnusedFrontend` and `requestFrontend`, along with their interaction with sensitive resources (`mFrontendResources`), suggests that `hasUnusedFrontend` should have a significant access control level.
- However, since `hasUnusedFrontend` is essentially a "getter" method (checking the status of resources without modifying them), it might not require as high a level of protection as methods that modify these resources (`SYS_OR_SIG` for modification).
- Considering the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing, but acknowledging the need to protect access to potentially sensitive information about frontend resources, an access control level of `NORMAL` seems appropriate. This balances the need to restrict access with the nature of the method as a "getter" that does not modify system state.

Therefore, based on the analysis and considering the principles of access control in Android:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision reflects the method's role in accessing potentially sensitive information without modifying it, while also acknowledging the similarities with other methods that interact with the same resources but may require higher levels of protection due to their ability to modify system state.
