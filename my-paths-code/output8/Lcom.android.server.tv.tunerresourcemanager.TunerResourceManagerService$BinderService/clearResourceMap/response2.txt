Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `clearResourceMap` method.

The `clearResourceMap` method has a high similarity with other APIs that interact with the same sinks, such as `restoreResourceMap`, `storeResourceMap`, and `setFrontendInfoList`. These APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

The `clearResourceMap` method modifies the resource map by replacing the frontend resources and counts with default values. This operation is similar to the ones performed by the other APIs mentioned above, which also modify the resource map.

Given the similarity in functionality and the fact that these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, I conclude that the `clearResourceMap` method should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `clearResourceMap` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level privileged applications can modify the resource map, which helps to prevent unauthorized access and potential security risks.
