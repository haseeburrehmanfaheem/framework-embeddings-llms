To determine the access control level for the `clearResourceMap` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `clearResourceMap` method has two paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 1): This path checks if the input parameter `p1` is equal to 0. If true, it calls several `replaceFeResourceMap` and `replaceFeCounts` methods from `TunerResourceManagerService`, passing in the object's fields (`mFrontendResources`, `mFrontendExistingNums`, `mFrontendUsedNums`, `mFrontendMaxUsableNums`) as arguments.
2. Path 2 (depth 0): This path simply calls another method, `clearResourceMapInternal`, on the object's parent class, passing in the input parameter `p1`.

The sink code for this method consists of two parts:
- The first part is similar to the code in Path 1 and involves replacing resource maps and counts.
- The second part involves calling `clearResourceMapInternal` with the input parameter.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs provided:

1. **restoreResourceMap(I)V**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code is very similar to Path 1 in `clearResourceMap`, as it also calls `replaceFeResourceMap` and `replaceFeCounts` methods from `TunerResourceManagerService`, but with backup fields.
2. **storeResourceMap(I)V**: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code checks if the input parameter is 0 and then performs operations similar to those in Path 1 of `clearResourceMap`, but it stores the current state into backup fields instead of clearing them.

Given these similarities, we can infer that the `clearResourceMap` method is performing sensitive operations related to resource management, similar to `restoreResourceMap` and `storeResourceMap`. These operations seem to require a certain level of access control, as they are modifying internal states of resources.

Since both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the nature of the operations performed by `clearResourceMap`, it's reasonable to conclude that `clearResourceMap` should also have a similar access control level. This is because all these methods interact with sensitive resource management functions, which likely require system or signature-level permissions to execute securely.

Therefore, based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `clearResourceMap` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This conclusion is drawn from the method's interaction with sensitive resource management operations and its similarity to other methods that have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
