To determine the access control level for the `storeResourceMap` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `storeResourceMap` takes an integer parameter `p1`. If `p1` equals 0, it calls several methods from `TunerResourceManagerService` to replace frontend resources and counts with their backup versions.
   - This operation seems to be related to managing or updating resource mappings, which could potentially impact system performance or functionality.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `restoreResourceMap(I)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It reverses the operation seen in `storeResourceMap` by restoring from backups, indicating that both storing and restoring resource maps are considered sensitive operations.
   - Another similar API, `clearResourceMap(I)V`, also has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. It clears resource maps by replacing them with default or zero values, which is another critical operation in terms of system resources.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs (`restoreResourceMap` and `clearResourceMap`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their impact on system resource management, it's logical to infer that `storeResourceMap` should also be considered sensitive.
   - The operation of storing a resource map, especially when it involves replacing existing data with backups (as seen in the code snippet), could have significant implications for system functionality and security. Thus, it requires a similar level of access control.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis of the method's functionality and its similarity to other APIs that manage system resources, the `storeResourceMap` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects its potential impact on system operations and the need for restricted access to prevent unauthorized or malicious modifications.
