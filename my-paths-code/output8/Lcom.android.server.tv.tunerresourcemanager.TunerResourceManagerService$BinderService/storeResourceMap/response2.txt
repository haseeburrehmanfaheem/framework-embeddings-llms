To determine the access control level for the `storeResourceMap` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs.

The `storeResourceMap` method appears to be responsible for storing or updating resource maps based on the input parameter `p1`. If `p1` is 0, it swaps the current resource maps with their backup versions using `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeResourceMap` and `TunerResourceManagerService.replaceFeCounts` methods.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `restoreResourceMap(I)V`: This method has a high similarity (0.944) with `storeResourceMap`. It restores the resource maps from their backup versions, which is essentially the reverse operation of what `storeResourceMap` does when `p1` is 0. The access control level for `restoreResourceMap` is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `clearResourceMap(I)V`: This method has a moderate similarity (0.932) with `storeResourceMap`. It clears the resource maps by replacing them with default values. The access control level for `clearResourceMap` is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. `getMaxNumberOfFrontends(I)I`: This method has a lower similarity (0.706) with `storeResourceMap`. It retrieves the maximum number of frontends for a given input parameter. Although its similarity is lower, its access control level is still `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering the similarities and the access control levels of these APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `storeResourceMap` method should have a similar access control level. Since all the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and given that writing data (as in the case of `storeResourceMap`) usually poses a greater security risk than reading it, the `storeResourceMap` method should also be protected at a similar or higher level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the final access control level for the `storeResourceMap` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision ensures that the method is secured appropriately to prevent unauthorized modifications to the resource maps, aligning with the protection levels of similar APIs in the system.
