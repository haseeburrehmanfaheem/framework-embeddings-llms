To determine the access control level for the `deleteBlob` method, we need to analyze its code snippets, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The `deleteBlob` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them seem to be related to deleting a blob based on the provided `long p1` parameter. The first path directly removes an entry from `mBlobsMap` if it matches the condition specified by the lambda function and then calls `writeBlobsInfoAsync()`. The second and third paths call `deleteBlobInternal`, which suggests that the actual deletion logic might be encapsulated within this method, possibly handling permissions or other critical operations.

The similar APIs provided are `releaseAllLeases` and `openSession`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that these methods require either system-level permissions or signature-level permissions to execute, suggesting they handle sensitive operations or data.

Given the context:
- The `deleteBlob` method seems to interact with internal blob management (e.g., removing entries from `mBlobsMap` and writing blobs info asynchronously), which could be considered a sensitive operation, especially if it involves user data or system resources.
- Both similar APIs (`releaseAllLeases` and `openSession`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they deal with operations that require elevated permissions.

Considering these points, the `deleteBlob` method likely requires a similar level of protection to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of blob data. Therefore, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `deleteBlob` method seems appropriate, as it aligns with the security posture of similar methods within the same functional domain.
