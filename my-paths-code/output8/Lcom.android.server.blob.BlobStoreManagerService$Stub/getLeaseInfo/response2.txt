To determine the access control level for the `getLeaseInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The code snippets show that the method performs checks on the input parameters (e.g., `BlobHandle`, `packageName`) and then retrieves lease information from a map (`mBlobsMap`). The method also calls other internal methods (`getLeaseInfoInternal`) to verify access permissions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code indicates that the method returns sensitive information (`LeaseInfo`) related to blobs, which could potentially be used to access or manipulate blob data.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `acquireLease`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8987 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with the `mBlobsMap` to add or replace leasees, which suggests that it requires system or signature-level permissions to modify blob leases.
   - `openBlob`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8314 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves a blob from the `mBlobsMap` and checks for access permissions before returning a `ParcelFileDescriptor`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permissions to access blobs.

Considering these factors, we can infer that the `getLeaseInfo` method likely requires system or signature-level permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG`) to protect sensitive blob information. Although it only retrieves lease information and does not modify it, the similarity in functionality with `acquireLease` and `openBlob`, which both require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, suggests that `getLeaseInfo` should have a similar level of protection.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippets, sink code, and similar APIs, the final access control level for the `getLeaseInfo` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
