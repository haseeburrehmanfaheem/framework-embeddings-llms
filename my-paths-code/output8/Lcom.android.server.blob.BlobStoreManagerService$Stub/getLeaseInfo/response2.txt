Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, it appears that the `getLeaseInfo` method is related to accessing or managing blob leases. The similar APIs, such as `acquireLease`, `openBlob`, `releaseLease`, `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes`, and `createSession`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions.

Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that these APIs are all part of the same class (`Lcom.android.server.blob.BlobStoreManagerService$Stub`), it is reasonable to conclude that the `getLeaseInfo` method should also have a similar access control level. This is because accessing lease information could potentially reveal sensitive data or allow for unauthorized access to blob leases, which would require system or signature-level permissions to protect.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs in the same class, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getLeaseInfo` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
