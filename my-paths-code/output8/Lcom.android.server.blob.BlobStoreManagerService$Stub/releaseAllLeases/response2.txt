To determine the access control level for the `releaseAllLeases` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve checking the calling UID and verifying if the package is allowed to access blob store data. This suggests that access control is enforced based on the caller's identity and permissions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `Binder.getCallingUid()` for getting the caller's UID, and then using this UID along with the package name (`p1`) to verify calling package permissions and check if blob store access is allowed. This further emphasizes the importance of caller identity in determining access control.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `releaseLease`, with high similarity scores (0.921 and 0.900). Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code for these similar APIs also involves verifying the calling package and checking if blob store access is allowed before proceeding with the lease release operation.

Given this information, we can infer that the `releaseAllLeases` method follows a similar pattern of access control as the provided similar APIs. It checks the caller's UID and verifies package permissions before releasing leases, which suggests that it requires a certain level of system or signature permission to execute successfully.

Therefore, considering the emphasis on verifying the caller's identity and permissions, and comparing with the access control levels of similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `releaseAllLeases` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
