To determine the access control level for the `releaseAllLeases` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs. The provided information includes the method's code snippets across different paths, sink code entries, and several similar APIs with their access control levels.

1. **Analysis of the Method**:
   - The `releaseAllLeases` method takes a package name as input and releases all leases associated with that package.
   - It checks if the calling UID is allowed to perform this operation by verifying the package name against the caller's UID and checking if the app is an instant app.
   - If the conditions are met, it iterates over the blobs map and removes leases for the specified package.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar APIs provided (`releaseLease`, `acquireLease`, `openBlob`, `getLeasedBlobs`, `deleteBlob`) all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These methods are related to managing blobs and leases, which involves sensitive operations such as acquiring, releasing, opening, or deleting blobs.
   - The presence of `verifyCallingPackage` and `isAllowedBlobStoreAccess` checks in these APIs indicates that they require a certain level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Given the sensitive nature of blob management operations, it's reasonable to infer that any method modifying leases or accessing blobs should have a restrictive access control level.
   - The `releaseAllLeases` method modifies lease information based on package names and caller UIDs, which suggests it requires protection against unauthorized calls.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the similarities in functionality with other blob management APIs and the need to protect against unauthorized modifications, the `releaseAllLeases` method should have an access control level that restricts its usage to system or signature applications.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate access control level for the `releaseAllLeases` method is `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the access control levels of similar APIs involved in blob management.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This conclusion is based on the analysis of the method's behavior, comparison with similar APIs, and considerations for protecting sensitive operations related to blob management.
