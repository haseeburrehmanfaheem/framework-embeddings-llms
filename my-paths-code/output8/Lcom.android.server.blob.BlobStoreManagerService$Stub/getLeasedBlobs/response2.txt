Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getLeasedBlobs` method.

The `getLeasedBlobs` method is used to retrieve a list of leased blobs for a given package name. The method calls `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the UID of the calling process and then verifies the calling package using `verifyCallingPackage`. This suggests that the method is sensitive to the identity of the caller and requires some level of access control.

The similar APIs provided, such as `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledCarrierApps`, `grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp`, `getTasks`, `releaseAllLeases`, and `editProperties`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also sensitive to the identity of the caller and require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getLeasedBlobs` method, I conclude that the `getLeasedBlobs` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level processes can call the `getLeasedBlobs` method, protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access.
