Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` method.

The method `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` is a getter method that returns the remaining lease quota bytes for a given package. The similar APIs provided, such as `releaseLease`, `getCacheQuotaBytes`, `getLeaseInfo`, `acquireLease`, and `getLeasedBlobs`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are related to blob store management and require system or signature-level permissions to access.

The `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` method, being a getter method, is less sensitive than the setter methods like `releaseLease` or `acquireLease`. However, it still requires some level of access control to ensure that only authorized packages can access this information.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the fact that this method is a getter, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes` method. This ensures that only system or signature-level permissions can access this method, aligning with the security requirements of the blob store management APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the analysis of similar APIs and the understanding that getter methods should have a similar or lower access control level than their corresponding setter methods. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level ensures that only authorized packages can access this method, maintaining the security and integrity of the blob store management system.
