To determine the access control level for the `queryBlobsForUser` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

All three code paths for `queryBlobsForUser` involve checking if the user ID (`p1`) is not equal to `-2`, and then they interact with `ActivityManager` and `LocalServices` to ensure that the user is not a special user. This check suggests that the method is concerned with user-specific data or functionality, which might require some level of access control.

The first path involves iterating over blobs using `BlobStoreManagerService.forEachBlobLocked`, which could imply handling sensitive data or system resources. The second and third paths call `queryBlobsForUserInternal`, which, despite its internal nature, still suggests dealing with user-specific blob data.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. **getEnabledInputMethodList**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7685877084732056 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with input method services and user settings, which are system-level functionalities that require signature or system-level permissions to modify or access sensitive information.

2. **getTvInteractiveAppServiceList**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7491469383239746 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It deals with TV interactive app services for a specific user, which seems less sensitive compared to input method settings or blob data that might contain various types of system or user information.

Given the similarities in functionality (dealing with user-specific data/services) but considering the potential sensitivity and system-level interaction of blob data, `queryBlobsForUser` seems more aligned with system-level operations than with freely accessible data. However, without explicit evidence of it dealing with highly sensitive information that would require dangerous permissions or being exclusively system or signature level, we must consider its access control in the context of user data management and system service interaction.

The method's focus on querying blobs for a specific user, ensuring the user is not special, and interacting with system services suggests it operates within a realm that requires some form of access control but does not explicitly indicate it handles dangerous permissions or exclusively system-level data without user implication.

Therefore, considering the provided information and comparisons, the most appropriate access control level for `queryBlobsForUser` would be `NORMAL`, as it deals with user-specific data in a manner that suggests a need for access control beyond `NONE` but does not clearly indicate the need for `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` levels based on the information provided.
