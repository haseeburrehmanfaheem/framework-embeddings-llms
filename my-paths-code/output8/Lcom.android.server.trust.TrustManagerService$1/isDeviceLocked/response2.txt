To determine the access control level for the `isDeviceLocked` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `isDeviceLocked` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve checking the calling UID and PID using `ITrustManager$Stub.getCallingUid()` and `ITrustManager$Stub.getCallingPid()`, respectively. The method also interacts with the `LockPatternUtils` class to check if a separate profile challenge is enabled.

The similar APIs provided are `isDeviceSecure(II)Z` and `sendAppPrivateCommand(Landroid/os/IBinder;Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/os/Bundle;I)V`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they can only be accessed by system or signature-protected applications.

The code for `isDeviceSecure(II)Z` is similar to the sink code provided for `isDeviceLocked`, and it also involves checking the calling UID and PID, as well as interacting with the `LockPatternUtils` class. This suggests that `isDeviceLocked` may require a similar level of access control.

The `sendAppPrivateCommand(Landroid/os/IBinder;Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/os/Bundle;I)V` API also involves checking the calling UID and PID, but its code is less similar to `isDeviceLocked`. However, it still requires a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, which suggests that `isDeviceLocked` may also require a restricted access control level.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `isDeviceLocked` method, as it involves sensitive operations and interacts with system-level classes.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
