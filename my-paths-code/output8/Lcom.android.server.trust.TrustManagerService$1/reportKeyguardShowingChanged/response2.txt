Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method interacts with a `Handler` object, which is used to send and remove messages. The method removes a message with code 6, sends an empty message with code 6, and runs a lambda expression using the `runWithScissors` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `reportEnabledTrustAgentsChanged(I)V`: This method has a similarity score of 0.9101631045341492 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It also interacts with a `Handler` object, removing messages and sending empty messages.
2. `unregisterTrustListener(Landroid/app/trust/ITrustListener;)V`: This method has a similarity score of 0.7696590423583984 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with a `Handler` object, obtaining a message and sending it to the target.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the underlying functionality. The `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method appears to be similar in terms of its interaction with the `Handler` object and the messages being sent and removed.

Given the similarities between the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method and the provided APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
