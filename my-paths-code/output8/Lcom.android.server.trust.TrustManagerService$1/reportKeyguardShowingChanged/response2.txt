Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method.

The similar APIs provided have a high similarity score with the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method, and they all interact with the same sink code, which involves sending messages to a handler. The access control levels assigned to these similar APIs are all `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities in code and functionality between the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method and the provided similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the fact that the method interacts with system-level components (e.g., handlers) and may potentially affect the security or functionality of the system, requiring a higher level of access control to prevent unauthorized access.
