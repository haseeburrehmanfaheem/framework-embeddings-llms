Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `unregisterTrustListener` method.

The `unregisterTrustListener` method has a high similarity with other methods that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods include:

* `registerTrustListener`: This method has a similarity of 0.9992721080780029 and 0.9975069761276245, and it requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
* `reportUserRequestedUnlock`: This method has a similarity of 0.9965027570724487 and 0.9742398858070374, and it also requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
* `reportUnlockLockout`: This method has a similarity of 0.9746758341789246, and it requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
* `registerStrongAuthTracker`: This method has a similarity of 0.9435282945632935, and it requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
* `reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock`: This method has a similarity of 0.9395110607147217, and it requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

All these methods interact with the same sink (Handler) and have similar code structures. Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `unregisterTrustListener` method should also require the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level to maintain consistency and ensure security.

Here is the assigned access control level in JSON format:
