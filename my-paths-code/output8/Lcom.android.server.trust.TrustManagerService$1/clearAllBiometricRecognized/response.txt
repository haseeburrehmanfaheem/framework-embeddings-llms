After analyzing the provided code for the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` API, I have identified potential sinks based on the given rules. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "SparseBooleanArray v3 = this.mUsersUnlockedByBiometric;",
            "v3.clear();"
        ],
        [
            "Handler v5 = this.mHandler;",
            "Message v6 = v5.obtainMessage(14, -1, 0);",
            "if (p2 < 0) {",
            "    Bundle v7 = new Bundle();",
            "    v7.putInt(\"except\", p2);",
            "    v6.setData(v7);",
            "    v6.sendToTarget();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink set includes the instructions that clear the `mUsersUnlockedByBiometric` SparseBooleanArray, which has naming similarity with the API name and is modified within the API.
2. The second sink set involves the creation of a new Message object using the `obtainMessage` method on the `mHandler` instance, followed by setting data to the message using the input parameter `p2`. This data flow link between instructions makes them part of the same sink set.

Both sink sets follow at least one of the positive rules and are ranked based on their sensitivity. The first sink set is more sensitive as it directly modifies a field related to biometric recognition, while the second sink set involves sending a message with potentially sensitive information (the `except` value).
