Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method.

The method interacts with sensitive data, specifically the `mUsersUnlockedByBiometric` SparseBooleanArray, which suggests that it requires a certain level of protection. The similar APIs provided, such as `unlockedByBiometricForUser`, `unregisterTrustListener`, `registerTrustListener`, `reportUnlockLockout`, and `reportUserRequestedUnlock`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the same handler and perform operations that could potentially impact the security or functionality of the system.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a similar access control level. The method's ability to clear the `mUsersUnlockedByBiometric` array and send messages to the handler could potentially be used to compromise the security of the system if not properly restricted.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the method's functionality, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
