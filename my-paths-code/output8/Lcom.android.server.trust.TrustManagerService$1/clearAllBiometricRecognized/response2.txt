To determine the access control level for the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method modifies a `SparseBooleanArray` named `mUsersUnlockedByBiometric` by clearing it and sends a message using a `Handler`. This suggests that the method is involved in managing user unlock states related to biometric recognition.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with `SparseBooleanArray` (clearing its content) and sending messages via a `Handler`, which are critical for managing internal state and communicating within the system.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **unlockedByBiometricForUser**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with the same `SparseBooleanArray` (`mUsersUnlockedByBiometric`) but instead of clearing it, puts a value into it based on the user ID and biometric source type. The similarity score is high (0.8914328813552856), indicating that this method shares significant functionality or purpose with `clearAllBiometricRecognized`.
   - **unregisterTrustListener**: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves sending a message via a `Handler` to unregister a trust listener, which is somewhat similar in the sense that it uses system-level communication mechanisms. The similarity score (0.8264947533607483) suggests a lesser but still notable similarity.

Given these points:

- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute, which is typically the case for methods that can impact system security or user data privacy directly.
- The operations performed by `clearAllBiometricRecognized` (modifying a critical internal state related to biometric unlock and sending system messages) are significant enough to warrant protection against unauthorized access.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it deals with sensitive user data (biometric recognition status) and system-level messaging, which could potentially be exploited if not properly secured.
