Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `reportEnabledTrustAgentsChanged` API.

The similar APIs provided are all related to trust management and have a high similarity score with the `reportEnabledTrustAgentsChanged` API. They all interact with the same sink (Handler) and have similar code patterns.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. This is likely due to the sensitive nature of trust management and the potential security risks associated with modifying trust settings.

Given the similarities between the `reportEnabledTrustAgentsChanged` API and the other APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that it also requires a high level of access control. Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `reportEnabledTrustAgentsChanged` API.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
