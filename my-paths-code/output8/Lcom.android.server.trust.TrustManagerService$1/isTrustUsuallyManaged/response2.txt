Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method.

The similar APIs provided are all related to trust management and have a high similarity score with the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method. They all interact with the same handler and send messages to it. The access control levels of these similar APIs are all `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission.

However, the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method is a getter method, which returns a boolean value indicating whether trust is usually managed for a given user. As mentioned in the problem statement, if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level, as writing data usually poses a greater security risk.

Since the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method is only reading data and not modifying it, its access control level can be lower than that of the similar APIs. Considering the similarities with the other APIs and the fact that it's a getter method, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
