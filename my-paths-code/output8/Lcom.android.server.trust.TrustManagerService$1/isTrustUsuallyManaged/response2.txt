Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method appears to be a getter method that returns a boolean value indicating whether trust is usually managed for a given user. The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately lead to the same sink code, which retrieves a value from a data structure or calls an internal method.

The similar APIs provided, `unregisterTrustListener` and `registerTrustListener`, have a similarity score of around 0.7, indicating that they are related to the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method does not perform any sensitive operations that would require system or signature-level permission. It simply retrieves a value from a data structure or calls an internal method, which does not pose a significant security risk.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the method's code and its similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `isTrustUsuallyManaged` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
