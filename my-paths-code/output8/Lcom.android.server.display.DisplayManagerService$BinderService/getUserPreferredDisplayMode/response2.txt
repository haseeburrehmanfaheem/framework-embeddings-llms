To determine the access control level for the `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode`: This API has a similarity of up to 0.9915034174919128 with `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` and has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `getDisplayInfo`: Although less similar (up to 0.7232601642608643), it also has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested`: With a similarity of up to 0.7187241315841675, its access control level is `NONE`.

2. **Semantics and Sinks**:
   - The method `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` retrieves the user's preferred display mode for a given display. This operation involves reading data related to display settings.
   - The sink code entries indicate interactions with `DisplayDevice` and `LogicalDisplay` objects, which are involved in managing display settings.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, reading data (as in the case of getter methods) is considered less sensitive than modifying it (setter methods). Therefore, if similar APIs that also read display-related data have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that reading such information might not be considered highly sensitive.
   - However, the specific security requirements can depend on the context and the potential impact of exposing user preferences or system settings.

Given these considerations:

- The high similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `NONE` suggests that `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` could also be classified as `NONE`, especially since it's a getter method that reads rather than modifies sensitive data.
- There's no clear indication from the provided information that this method poses a significant security risk by itself, which would necessitate a higher access control level like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of the operation (reading user-preferred display mode), the most appropriate access control level for `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` seems to be `NONE`.
