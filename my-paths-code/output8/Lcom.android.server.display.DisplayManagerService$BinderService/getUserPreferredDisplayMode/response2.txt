To determine the access control level for the `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them ultimately lead to either getting a `DisplayDevice` and calling its `getUserPreferredDisplayModeLocked()` method or directly calling `getUserPreferredDisplayModeInternal(p1)` on another object.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `DisplayDevice` to get the user-preferred display mode, which is similar to how other methods (like `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode`) operate.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two instances of `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` are provided as similar APIs, both with an access control level of `NONE`. 
   - The first instance directly interacts with a `DisplayDevice` to get the system-preferred display mode, similar to one of the paths in `getUserPreferredDisplayMode`.
   - The second instance calls an internal method (`getSystemPreferredDisplayModeInternal`) on another object, which parallels the path in `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` that calls `getUserPreferredDisplayModeInternal`.

Given these points:

- **Similarity with Other APIs**: Both provided similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and their operations (getting a preferred display mode) are analogous to what `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` does. The method's interactions, whether through `DisplayDevice` or internal methods, do not indicate a need for elevated permissions based on the information given.

- **Nature of the Operation**: Getting the user-preferred display mode doesn't inherently suggest an operation that would compromise system security, leak sensitive data, or perform actions typically reserved for system or signature applications. It seems to be a query about display settings rather than an action that modifies system state in a dangerous way.

Based on this analysis and considering the access control levels provided for similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `getUserPreferredDisplayMode` should also have an access control level of `NONE`, as it doesn't appear to pose risks associated with higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL` if we consider the context of provided similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
