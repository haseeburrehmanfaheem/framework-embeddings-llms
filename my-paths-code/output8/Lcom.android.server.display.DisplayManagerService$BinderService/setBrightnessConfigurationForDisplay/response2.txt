To determine the access control level for the `setBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` method, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `getBrightnessConfigurationForUser` and `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

Given that these getter methods require a system or signature-level permission, it implies that the data they are accessing is sensitive or critical to the system's operation. When considering the setter method `setBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay`, we must recognize that writing data (in this case, setting brightness configuration) typically poses a greater security risk than reading it. Therefore, if the corresponding getter methods are protected at the `SYS_OR_SIG` level, it is logical to secure the setter method with an equal or higher access control level.

However, since the provided information does not include any similar APIs that are setter methods, we must rely on the principle that writing data usually requires at least the same level of protection as reading it. Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that both provided getter methods have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to assign a similar or higher level of access control to the `setBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` method.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for the `setBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the protection levels of the related getter methods and acknowledges the potential security implications of modifying display brightness configurations.
