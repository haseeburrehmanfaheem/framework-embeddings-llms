Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` method.

The method interacts with the `UserManager` to get the user serial number and then retrieves the brightness configuration from the `PersistentDataStore`. The similar APIs provided also interact with the `UserManager` and retrieve brightness configurations, which suggests that they are related to system-level operations.

The access control levels of the similar APIs are both `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require either system or signature-level permissions. Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` method, it is likely that this method also requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
