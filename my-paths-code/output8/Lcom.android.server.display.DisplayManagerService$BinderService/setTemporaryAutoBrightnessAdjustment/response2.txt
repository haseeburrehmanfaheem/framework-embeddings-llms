To determine the access control level for the `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs.

The two code paths provided show that this method interacts with system-level components:

1. **Path 1**: It sends a message to a handler (`this.mHandler.obtainMessage(7, v8, 0)`) after converting the float parameter `p1` to an integer. This interaction suggests a level of system or signature access is required because it involves internal messaging that could potentially affect system behavior.

2. **Path 2**: It directly calls `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment(p1)` on an object retrieved from a sparse array (`v5.get(0)`), which implies direct manipulation of display settings, a system-level functionality.

The similar APIs provided also give insight into the potential access control level:

- **`setTemporaryBrightness(IF)V`**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9914495348930359) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows it also sends a message to a handler after converting a float parameter, similar to Path 1 of `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment`.

- **`removeUidPolicy(II)V`**: Although its similarity score (0.8553171157836914) is lower than the first API, it's still significant and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves sending a message to a handler as well.

Given these observations:

- Both paths of `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` involve system-level interactions (either through messaging or direct manipulation of display settings).
- The similar APIs (`setTemporaryBrightness` and `removeUidPolicy`) have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating they require either system or signature level permissions to execute.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality and its similarity with other APIs that are classified as requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access, it is reasonable to conclude that `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` should also be assigned a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
