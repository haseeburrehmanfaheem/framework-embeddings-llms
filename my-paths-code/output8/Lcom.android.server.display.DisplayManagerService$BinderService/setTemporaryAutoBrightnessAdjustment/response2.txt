Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, we can make an informed decision about the access control level for the `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` method.

The method interacts with display power controllers and sends messages to a handler, which is similar to other APIs that have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. These similar APIs include:

* `setTemporaryBrightness`: This API has a similarity of 0.9914493560791016 and is also related to display brightness adjustments.
* `removeUidPolicy`, `reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock`, `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout`, and `userPresent`: Although these APIs have lower similarities (ranging from 0.8553171753883362 to 0.8297335505485535), they all interact with handlers and have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Given that the `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` method is related to display brightness adjustments and interacts with a handler, it is reasonable to assign it an access control level similar to its counterparts. Since reading data (e.g., getting the current brightness) is generally less sensitive than modifying it (e.g., setting temporary auto-brightness adjustment), and considering that the corresponding getter methods for these similar APIs do not necessarily require the same level of restriction, we should focus on the setter method's access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their assigned access control levels, I conclude that the `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
