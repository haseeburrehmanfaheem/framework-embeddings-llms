To determine the access control level for the `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method is a getter that returns a boolean value indicating whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed. The similar APIs provided are:

1. `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V`: This is a setter method that sets the value of `mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V`: This method sets the user-disabled HDR types and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. `getUserDisabledHdrTypes()[I`: This is a getter method that returns the user-disabled HDR types and has an access control level of `NONE`.

Considering the principle that if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction, we can infer that the `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method may not require the same level of access control as its corresponding setter method.

However, since the `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is likely that the `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method should have a higher access control level than `NONE`.

Given the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment takes into account the principle that reading data (in this case, a boolean value) is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and therefore, the getter method may have a lower access control level than its corresponding setter method. However, since the related setter method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, the getter method should still have a moderate access control level to ensure that the data is not exposed unnecessarily.
