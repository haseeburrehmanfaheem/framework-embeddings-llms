To determine the access control level for the `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths, but both essentially return a boolean value indicating whether user-disabled HDR types are allowed. This suggests that the method is primarily used to retrieve or query a setting rather than modify system state.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code focuses on returning the value of `mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`, which aligns with the method's purpose of querying a setting.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission to modify the setting that `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` queries. The high similarity score suggests that both methods operate on related aspects of HDR type settings.
   - **setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V**: Also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method modifies user-disabled HDR types, which is closely related to the query performed by `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`.

Given these points:

- The `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method does not modify system state but rather queries it. This typically suggests a lower risk compared to methods that can alter settings.
- However, its similarity and relation to methods with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels (which are used for setting or modifying related HDR type allowances) imply that while the query itself might be less risky, the information it provides or the context in which it's used could still be sensitive or system-critical.

Considering these factors, assigning an access control level of `NONE` might underestimate the potential sensitivity or system relevance of the information being queried. On the other hand, `DANGEROUS` seems too severe since the method doesn't directly manipulate sensitive data or perform actions that could immediately compromise user privacy or device security. Between `NORMAL` and `SYS_OR_SIG`, given the method's query nature and its relation to system settings that are modified by `SYS_OR_SIG` level methods, `NORMAL` seems more appropriate as it acknowledges some level of access control without requiring system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
