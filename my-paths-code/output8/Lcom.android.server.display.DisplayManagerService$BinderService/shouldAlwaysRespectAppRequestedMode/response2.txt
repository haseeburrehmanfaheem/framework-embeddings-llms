To determine the access control level for the `shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode` method in the `DisplayManagerService$BinderService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of the Method**: The `shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode` method appears to be a getter method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the app's requested mode should always be respected. The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all essentially boil down to returning a value related to this setting, either directly from a field (`mAlwaysRespectAppRequest`), through another object's method (`mDisplayModeDirector.shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode()`), or by calling an internal method (`shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedModeInternal()`).

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **setShouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode(Z)V**: This is a setter method for the same setting that `shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode` gets. It has a high similarity to the getter method and requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Given that writing data usually poses a greater security risk than reading it, if the setter requires `SYS_OR_SIG`, the getter does not necessarily need the same level of restriction.
   - **getRefreshRateSwitchingType()I**: This method has a lower similarity and is related to getting a different type of display setting. It requires no special access control (`NONE`).
   - **isAssistDataAllowedOnCurrentActivity()Z**: Although this method is from a different service and has a relatively low similarity, it's also a getter method that returns a boolean value related to permissions or settings. It does not require any specific access control (`NONE`).

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given the nature of `shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode` as a getter method, which generally poses less risk than setter methods.
   - Considering the high similarity and the access control level of its corresponding setter method (`SYS_OR_SIG`), but acknowledging that getters typically require less stringent access controls than their setter counterparts.
   - Reflecting on the principle that reading data is usually less sensitive than modifying it.

Based on these considerations, while the `setShouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode` method requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control due to its ability to modify settings, the `shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode` method, being a getter, does not necessarily need such a high level of restriction. However, since it deals with display settings that could potentially impact system behavior or security, assigning it a moderate level of access control seems prudent.

Therefore, considering the options provided (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), and given that this method is related to system settings but does not directly imply a dangerous operation or require signature or system level access just for reading, a reasonable assignment would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice reflects the method's nature as a getter that provides information about system settings, which might not be entirely public but also doesn't necessitate the highest levels of protection typically reserved for operations that can directly alter sensitive system states or user data.
