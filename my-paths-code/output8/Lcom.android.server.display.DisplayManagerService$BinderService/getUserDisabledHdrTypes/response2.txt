To determine the access control level for the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths, both of which return an array of integers (`[I`) representing user-disabled HDR types. One path directly accesses `this.mUserDisabledHdrTypes`, and the other uses a nested class to access the same variable.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z` has a similarity score of 0.8347076177597046 and an access control level of `NONE`. This method checks if user-disabled HDR types are allowed, which is related but does not directly modify or expose sensitive data.
   - `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V` has a similarity score of 0.8134934306144714 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method sets the user-disabled HDR types, implying it can modify system settings or sensitive data.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not pose a risk to user privacy or device security.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that may have some implications but are generally safe under normal usage conditions.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can potentially harm the user's privacy or the device's security, such as those accessing sensitive data without permission.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Usually for system-level operations or those requiring signature-level permissions, indicating a higher level of access control.

Given these considerations:

- The `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method returns an array related to HDR settings but does not modify any settings. It's more about retrieving information rather than altering system states or accessing highly sensitive data.
- The similarity with `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z` (access level `NONE`) suggests that the operation might be considered relatively safe, as it's about querying a state rather than changing it.
- However, the similarity with `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V` (access level `SYS_OR_SIG`) indicates there could be system-level implications or at least a need for controlled access to such settings.

Considering these points, since `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` is primarily about retrieving information and not directly altering sensitive data or system settings, it leans more towards requiring minimal protection. However, because it deals with system settings (albeit in a read-only manner), assigning an access control level of `NONE` seems appropriate, given the context provided by similar APIs.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's nature of retrieving rather than modifying data and its similarity to other methods with known access control levels.
