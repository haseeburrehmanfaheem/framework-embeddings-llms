To determine the access control level for the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z`: This method has an access control level of `NONE`. It suggests that reading the allowed state does not pose a significant security risk.
   - `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V` and `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V`: Both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that modifying these settings requires higher security clearance due to potential risks or system impact.

2. **Getter vs. Setter Security**:
   - Generally, getter methods (which read data) are considered less sensitive than setter methods (which modify data). However, if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should have an equal or higher level of access control.
   - Given that `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V` has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it implies that modifying user-disabled HDR types is sensitive. Therefore, reading this information (`getUserDisabledHdrTypes`) might also be considered sensitive to some extent but typically less so than setting it.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Since the similar setter methods have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their potential system impact or security risks, and considering that getters are generally less restrictive than setters, `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` could be assigned a lower access control level than its corresponding setter.
   - However, given the context of display settings and user data, which might not be entirely public or freely accessible without some form of authentication or authorization, assigning `NONE` might be too permissive. 
   - Between `NORMAL` and `SYS_OR_SIG`, considering that reading (getter) is less sensitive than writing (setter), and acknowledging the potential for this information to be somewhat restricted but not as highly controlled as system or signature-level permissions, `NORMAL` seems a reasonable choice.

**Conclusion**: Given the analysis of similar APIs and the general principles guiding access control levels in Android, the `getUserDisabledHdrTypes` method should have an access control level that reflects its role as a getter method related to display settings. Thus, it should be less restrictive than its corresponding setter but still might require some form of access control.
