Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` API.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access. These APIs are related to display management and seem to be retrieving information about displays, which is a relatively low-risk operation.

The `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` API also appears to be retrieving information about the system's preferred display mode, which is similar in nature to the other APIs. The sink code entries provided do not indicate any sensitive operations or data being accessed.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` API does not require any specific access control restrictions and can be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
