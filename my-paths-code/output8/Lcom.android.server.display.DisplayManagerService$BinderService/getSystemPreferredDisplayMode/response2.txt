To determine the access control level for the `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths (depth 0, 1, and 2) of the `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` method involve retrieving a display mode related to system preferences.
   - Path 1 and Path 2 involve getting a `DisplayDevice` for a given display and then calling `getSystemPreferredDisplayModeLocked()` on it. The difference lies in how they obtain the `DisplayDevice`.
   - Path 3 directly calls an internal method `getSystemPreferredDisplayModeInternal(p1)` without explicitly dealing with `DisplayDevice`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets involve getting a `DisplayDevice` for a display and then retrieving its preferred display mode, either system or user preferred.
   - This indicates that the critical operation is accessing and returning display modes, which could potentially be sensitive information but seems to be handled similarly across different methods.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `getUserPreferredDisplayMode(I)Landroid/view/Display$Mode;` has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - This suggests that retrieving display mode preferences (whether system or user preferred) is not considered a sensitive operation requiring higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`, or even `NORMAL`.

Given these observations:
- The operations involved in `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` are similar to those in the APIs with an access control level of `NONE`.
- There's no indication that system-preferred display modes are more sensitive than user-preferred ones, which also have an access control level of `NONE`.
- The method does not perform any operations that would typically require elevated permissions (e.g., accessing external storage, camera, location, etc.).

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of the operation, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.
