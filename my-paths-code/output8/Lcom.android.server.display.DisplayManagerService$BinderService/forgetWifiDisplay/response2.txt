To determine the access control level for the `forgetWifiDisplay` method, we need to analyze its similar APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

1. **connectWifiDisplay**: This API has a similarity score ranging from 0.783 to 0.909 with `forgetWifiDisplay`, indicating a high degree of similarity in terms of functionality or code structure. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that connecting to a WiFi display requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to the potential security implications of establishing such connections.

2. **pauseWifiDisplay**: With a similarity score range of 0.790 to 0.902, this API also shows significant similarities with `forgetWifiDisplay`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, implying that pausing a WiFi display operation requires system or signature-level permission, possibly due to the need to manage and secure ongoing display connections.

3. **disconnectWifiDisplay**: Although it has a lower similarity score (0.808), this API's functionality is closely related to managing WiFi display connections. Notably, its access control level is `NONE`, indicating that disconnecting from a WiFi display does not require special permissions. This could be because disconnecting is seen as a less sensitive operation compared to connecting or pausing, which might involve more critical security or system resource management.

4. **startWifiDisplayScan**: With a similarity score of 0.800, this API is also related to managing WiFi displays, specifically initiating scans for available displays. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that scanning for WiFi displays requires system or signature-level permission, possibly due to the potential for exposing device information or initiating unauthorized connections.

5. **getWifiDisplayStatus**: This API has a lower similarity score (0.784) and is focused on retrieving status information about WiFi displays. Its access control level is `NONE`, indicating that getting the status of WiFi displays does not require special permissions, likely because it's considered a read-only operation with less security risk compared to operations that modify or initiate connections.

Considering these similarities and access control levels:
- The operations that involve modifying, connecting, or initiating actions related to WiFi displays (`connectWifiDisplay`, `pauseWifiDisplay`, `startWifiDisplayScan`) generally require `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions due to their potential impact on system security and resource management.
- Operations that are read-only or less sensitive in terms of security risk (`getWifiDisplayStatus`, `disconnectWifiDisplay`) have lower or no special permission requirements.

Given the nature of `forgetWifiDisplay`, which involves forgetting a WiFi display (an operation that could potentially be seen as modifying system settings or affecting how the device interacts with external displays), it would likely fall into the category of operations requiring higher access control to prevent unauthorized modifications. However, considering the specific similarities and the context provided, the exact level of risk or sensitivity might vary.

Given these considerations, a reasonable approach would be to align `forgetWifiDisplay` with APIs that manage WiFi display connections and settings, suggesting a need for system or signature-level permission to ensure security and proper management of device resources.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, the final access control level for the `forgetWifiDisplay` API would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination reflects the potential security implications and system resource management considerations associated with managing WiFi display connections and settings.
