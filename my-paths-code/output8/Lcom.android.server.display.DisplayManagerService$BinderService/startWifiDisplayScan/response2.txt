To assign an access control level to the `startWifiDisplayScan` method in the `Lcom.android.server.display.DisplayManagerService$BinderService` class, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `stopWifiDisplayScan()V`: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `pauseWifiDisplay()V`: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `connectWifiDisplay(Ljava/lang/String;)V`: SYS_OR_SIG
4. `forgetWifiDisplay(Ljava/lang/String;)V`: SYS_OR_SIG
5. `getWifiDisplayStatus()Landroid/hardware/display/WifiDisplayStatus;`: NONE

The first four similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to execute. This is likely because they are modifying the state of the Wi-Fi display or performing actions that could potentially impact the system's behavior.

On the other hand, `getWifiDisplayStatus()` has an access control level of NONE, indicating that it does not require any special permissions to execute. This is likely because it is only retrieving information about the current state of the Wi-Fi display and not modifying anything.

Given the similarities between `startWifiDisplayScan` and the first four APIs (stop, pause, connect, forget), it is reasonable to conclude that `startWifiDisplayScan` should also have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This is because starting a Wi-Fi display scan could potentially impact the system's behavior or modify its state, similar to the other actions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their assigned access control levels, I assign the following access control level to the `startWifiDisplayScan` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is informed by the similarities with other system-level APIs that manage Wi-Fi display functionality and the potential impact of starting a Wi-Fi display scan on the system's behavior.
