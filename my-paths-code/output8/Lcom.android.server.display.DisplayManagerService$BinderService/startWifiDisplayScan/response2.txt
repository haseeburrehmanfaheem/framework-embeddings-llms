To determine the access control level for the `startWifiDisplayScan` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of `startWifiDisplayScan` involve getting the calling PID (`Binder.getCallingPid()`) and clearing the calling identity (`Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`). This suggests that the method is designed to handle interactions that require identifying or authenticating the caller, which is a common practice for methods that need to enforce specific access controls.
   - The method then proceeds to call either `startWifiDisplayScanLocked`, `startWifiDisplayScanInternal`, or its nested version, passing the PID or an object related to it. This indicates that the actual logic of starting the Wi-Fi display scan is encapsulated within these internal methods.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs provided are `stopWifiDisplayScan()` with a high similarity score (above 0.88), and both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to Wi-Fi display scans (starting or stopping) are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permissions.
   - The code snippets for `stopWifiDisplayScan()` also involve internal method calls similar to `startWifiDisplayScan`, reinforcing the idea that these operations are treated with a certain level of security and access control.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the similarities in code structure, the involvement of PID and identity clearing, and the comparison with similar APIs (`stopWifiDisplayScan()`), it's reasonable to infer that `startWifiDisplayScan` should have a comparable access control level.
   - The fact that both provided similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` indicates that such operations are not freely accessible and require either system-level permissions or signature-level verification, which aligns with the sensitive nature of managing Wi-Fi display scans.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of code paths and the comparison with similar APIs (`stopWifiDisplayScan()`), it's logical to conclude that `startWifiDisplayScan` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects the method's need for secure and controlled access, likely due to its impact on system resources or user data.
