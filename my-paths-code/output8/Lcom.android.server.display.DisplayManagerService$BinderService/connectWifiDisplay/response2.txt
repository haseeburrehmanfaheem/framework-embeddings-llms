To determine the access control level for the `connectWifiDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `pauseWifiDisplay()V`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `forgetWifiDisplay(Ljava/lang/String;)V`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `startWifiDisplayScan()V`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `disconnectWifiDisplay()V`: NONE
   - `getWifiDisplayStatus()Landroid/hardware/display/WifiDisplayStatus;`: NONE

2. **Semantics of the APIs**:
   - The `connectWifiDisplay` method is involved in establishing a connection to a WiFi display, which implies modifying system settings or states related to display connectivity.
   - Similar methods like `pauseWifiDisplay`, `forgetWifiDisplay`, and `startWifiDisplayScan` are also involved in managing WiFi display connections but have different access control levels assigned.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink codes for `connectWifiDisplay` involve requesting a connection through the WiFi display adapter or calling internal methods to handle the connection process.
   - Similar APIs' sink codes also deal with internal method calls for managing WiFi displays, indicating that these operations are critical and potentially sensitive.

4. **Access Control Principles**:
   - If a setter method (or an equivalent method that modifies system state) requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction.
   - However, if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level.

Given these considerations:

- The `connectWifiDisplay` method modifies system state by initiating a connection to a WiFi display. This action could potentially introduce security risks or affect system stability if not properly controlled.
- Similar methods (`pauseWifiDisplay`, `forgetWifiDisplay`, `startWifiDisplayScan`) that also modify system states related to WiFi displays have been assigned SYS_OR_SIG access control levels, indicating they require significant privileges to execute.
- The exception is `disconnectWifiDisplay` with NONE access control and `getWifiDisplayStatus` which has no direct influence on the decision for `connectWifiDisplay` as it's a getter method.

Considering the potential impact of connecting to a WiFi display on system security and stability, and aligning with the access control levels assigned to similar methods that manage WiFi display connections, the most appropriate access control level for `connectWifiDisplay` would be SYS_OR_SIG. This ensures that only system or signature applications can initiate such connections, thereby maintaining system integrity and security.
