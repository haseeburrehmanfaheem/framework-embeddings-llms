To determine the access control level for the `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sinks, and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Path 1 involves directly accessing `this.mWideColorSpace.getId()` to retrieve an ID, which suggests a straightforward operation without any apparent security risks or sensitive data exposure.
   - Path 2 calls `this.this$0.getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceIdInternal()`, delegating the retrieval of the preferred wide gamut color space ID to another internal method. This could imply a slightly more complex logic but still doesn't inherently suggest high-risk operations.

2. **Sinks Analysis**:
   - The sinks provided show that the method's return value is directly derived from either `this.mWideColorSpace.getId()` or `this.this$0.getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceIdInternal()`. Neither of these operations, based on their names and the context given, seems to involve sensitive data or actions that could compromise security.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The provided similar APIs (`getColorMode()I`) have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating they do not pose significant security risks.
   - These APIs also seem to follow a pattern of directly accessing or delegating the retrieval of specific display settings (color mode in their case), which aligns with the behavior observed in `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId`.

Given these observations:
- The method does not appear to handle sensitive data or perform actions that could compromise system security.
- Its behavior is similar to other APIs that have been classified as having no significant access control requirements (`NONE`).

Therefore, based on the analysis of its code paths, sinks, and comparison with similar APIs, the `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId` method should be assigned an access control level that reflects its low-risk nature.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
