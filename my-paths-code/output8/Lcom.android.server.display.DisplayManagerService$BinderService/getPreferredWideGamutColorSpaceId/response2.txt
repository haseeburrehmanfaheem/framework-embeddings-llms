Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId` method.

The method is a getter, which generally has less restriction than a setter. The similar APIs provided also have relatively low access control levels:

* `getColorMode()` has an access control level of `NONE`.
* `getNightDisplayColorTemperature()` has an access control level of `NONE`.
* `getNightDisplayAutoMode()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which is higher, but this might be due to the specific requirements of night display auto mode.

Considering that reading data (in this case, getting the preferred wide gamut color space ID) is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and the similar APIs have low access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getPreferredWideGamutColorSpaceId` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the method is a getter, and the similar APIs have relatively low access control levels. Additionally, the method does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it only returns an ID related to display settings.
