Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getDefaultBrightnessConfiguration` method.

The method appears to be related to display brightness configuration, which is a sensitive feature that could potentially impact device security or user experience. The similar APIs provided, such as `getBrightnessConfigurationForUser`, `getBrightness`, and `getBrightnessConfigurationForDisplay`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getDefaultBrightnessConfiguration` method, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a similar access control level. Additionally, since this method is a getter method, which is generally less sensitive than setter methods, it may not require the highest level of restriction.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the semantics of the `getDefaultBrightnessConfiguration` method, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
