To determine the access control level for the `releaseVirtualDisplay` method, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
- `setVirtualDisplaySurface`: NONE
- `setVirtualDisplayState`: NONE
- `resizeVirtualDisplay`: NONE
- `isDeviceSecure`: SYS_OR_SIG (highly restrictive due to security reasons)
- `createVirtualDisplay`: SYS_OR_SIG (highly restrictive, possibly due to the creation of virtual displays requiring system or signature-level permissions)

Among these APIs, `setVirtualDisplaySurface`, `setVirtualDisplayState`, and `resizeVirtualDisplay` all have an access control level of NONE. This suggests that operations related to modifying or interacting with virtual displays do not necessarily require high levels of access control.

However, `createVirtualDisplay` has a SYS_OR_SIG access control level, indicating that creating new virtual displays is considered a sensitive operation requiring either system-level or signature-level permissions. This could be due to the potential security implications or the need for these operations to be tightly controlled.

The method in question, `releaseVirtualDisplay`, seems to be related to the management of existing virtual displays rather than their creation. Given its similarities with `setVirtualDisplaySurface`, `setVirtualDisplayState`, and `resizeVirtualDisplay`, which all have an access control level of NONE, it suggests that releasing a virtual display might not require as stringent access controls as creating one.

Considering these points:
- The operation is related to the release of resources (in this case, a virtual display) rather than their creation or sensitive modification.
- Similar APIs for modifying virtual displays (`setVirtualDisplaySurface`, `setVirtualDisplayState`, `resizeVirtualDisplay`) have an access control level of NONE.
- The creation of virtual displays (`createVirtualDisplay`) requires SYS_OR_SIG permissions, but this is likely due to the security and system implications of creating new displays.

Given these considerations, it seems reasonable that `releaseVirtualDisplay` would not require as high a level of access control as `createVirtualDisplay`. However, without explicit information suggesting it should be highly restricted like `isDeviceSecure`, or considering the general principle that releasing resources might be less sensitive than creating them but could still impact system functionality, we must decide based on the provided similarities and the nature of the operation.

Therefore, considering the method's purpose and its similarity to other methods with lower access control levels, a reasonable assignment for `releaseVirtualDisplay` would be an access control level that reflects its potential impact on system resources and security. Given the context and comparisons, assigning it a level similar to its closely related operations seems appropriate.

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
