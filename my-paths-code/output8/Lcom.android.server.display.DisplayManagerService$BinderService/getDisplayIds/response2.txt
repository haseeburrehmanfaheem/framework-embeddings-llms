To determine the access control level for the `getDisplayIds` method in the `DisplayManagerService$BinderService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `getDisplayIds` method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them involve checking the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and then performing some operations based on that UID. The method returns an array of display IDs.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of either `NONE` or `SYS_OR_SIG`. To make an informed decision, let's examine each similar API:

1. `getServiceDeviceInfo`: This method has a similarity score of 0.821 and an access control level of `NONE`. It checks if the UID is allowed using `isUidAllowed`.
2. `createSession`: This method has a similarity score of 0.801 and an access control level of `NONE`. It gets the calling UID and PID but doesn't seem to perform any specific access control checks based on these values.
3. `openDevice`: This method has a similarity score of 0.797 and an access control level of `NONE`. It checks if the device is private, but this doesn't directly relate to the access control level.
4. `getSearchablesInGlobalSearch`: This method has a similarity score of 0.796 and an access control level of `NONE`. It involves getting the calling user ID and performing some operations based on that, but it doesn't seem to have strict access control.
5. `getUserRestrictionSources`: This method has a similarity score of 0.791 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves getting the calling UID and packages for that UID, indicating a need for system or signature-level access control due to its sensitive nature.

Given these similarities and the operations performed by `getDisplayIds`, we notice that it does involve checking the calling UID and performing actions based on display information, which could be considered sensitive. However, unlike `getUserRestrictionSources`, it doesn't deal with user restriction sources or packages directly, which are typically under stricter access control.

Considering the method's functionality and the similarities with other APIs, especially noting that most similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` but involve less sensitive operations, we can infer that `getDisplayIds` might require some level of protection due to its interaction with display information. However, it doesn't seem to warrant the highest level of protection like `SYS_OR_SIG` unless it's dealing with highly sensitive or system-critical display configurations not evident from the provided paths.

Given this analysis and considering the principle that reading data (like display IDs) is generally less sensitive than modifying it, but still requires some form of access control to prevent unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information about the device's displays, we would lean towards assigning a moderate level of access control. However, since most similar APIs provided have `NONE` as their access control level and considering the nature of `getDisplayIds`, which seems more aligned with informational retrieval rather than system-critical operations or sensitive data modification, the most appropriate access control level based on the given information would be `NORMAL`. This reflects a balance between security and usability, acknowledging that while the method doesn't seem to require the highest levels of protection, it still should not be entirely open.
