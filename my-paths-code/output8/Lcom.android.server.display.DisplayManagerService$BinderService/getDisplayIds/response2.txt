To determine the access control level for the `getDisplayIds` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `getDisplayIds` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path checks if the calling UID has access to the display using `Display.hasAccess(v1, this.flags, this.ownerUid, this.displayId)`. If access is denied, it returns an empty array.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path checks if the calling UID has access to the display using `v9.hasAccess(v1)`. If access is denied, it returns an empty array.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path calls `v4.getDisplayIdsLocked(v1)` and returns the result.

The similar APIs provided have a similarity score above 0.8, which indicates that they are quite similar to the `getDisplayIds` method. Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and check if the calling UID is allowed using `v10.isUidAllowed(v1)`.

Comparing the code paths of `getDisplayIds` with the similar APIs, we can see that all of them perform some kind of access control check using the calling UID. However, the `getDisplayIds` method does not seem to enforce any strict access control, as it returns an empty array if access is denied, rather than throwing an exception or returning an error.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getDisplayIds` method, as it does not seem to pose a significant security risk and its behavior is similar to that of the provided similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
