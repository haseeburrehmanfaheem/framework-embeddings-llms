Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method.

The `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method is a setter that modifies the `mAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` field and also updates the "are_user_disabled_hdr_formats_allowed" setting using `Settings$Global.putInt`. This suggests that the method has some level of sensitivity, as it can affect the behavior of the display manager service.

Looking at the similar APIs:

* `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires a high level of privilege to call. This is likely because it modifies the user-disabled HDR types, which could have security implications.
* `areUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed()Z` and `getUserDisabledHdrTypes()[I` both have an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that reading the current state of the display manager service is not considered sensitive.

However, since `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` is a setter method that can modify the behavior of the display manager service, it is likely to require some level of access control. Given that `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V` requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it is reasonable to assign a similar or lower level of access control to `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`.

Considering the sensitivity of the method and the access control levels of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`. This ensures that only system or signature-privileged applications can call this method, which helps to prevent unauthorized modifications to the display manager service.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
