To determine the access control level for the `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve setting a value related to user-disabled HDR types and interacting with settings through `Settings$Global.putInt`. This suggests that the method is modifying system settings.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code points out specific lines where the method's logic branches based on the input parameter `p1` and where it writes to system settings using `Settings$Global.putInt`.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V`, with high similarity scores (0.9653550982475281 and 0.9627465009689331). Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code for these similar APIs involves internal method calls (`this.this$0.setUserDisabledHdrTypesInternal(p1);` and `DisplayManagerService.-$$Nest$msetUserDisabledHdrTypesInternal(this.this$0, p1);`) which are related to setting user-disabled HDR types, suggesting they modify system settings or behave in a privileged manner.

Given this information:

- The method `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` modifies system settings through `Settings$Global.putInt`, which typically requires certain privileges.
- The similar APIs provided (`setUserDisabledHdrTypes([I)V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are either signature or system protected, meaning they can only be called by the system or applications signed with the same certificate as the application that owns the API (or those explicitly granted this permission).
- The logic and interactions with system settings in `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` align with behaviors that would require protection against arbitrary access to prevent misuse or unauthorized changes to system settings.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality, its interaction with system settings, and the access control levels of similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed` should also have a restrictive access control level to protect against unauthorized access or malicious use.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the method's need for protection similar to that of system or signature-protected APIs, given its role in modifying system settings related to user-disabled HDR types.
