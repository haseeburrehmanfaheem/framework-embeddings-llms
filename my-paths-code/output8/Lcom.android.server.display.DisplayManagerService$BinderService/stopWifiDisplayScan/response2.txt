To determine the access control level for the `stopWifiDisplayScan` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths (depth 2, depth 1, and depth 0) involve getting the calling PID using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and clearing the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`. This is a common pattern for handling IPC (Inter-Process Communication) in Android, which suggests that this method is designed to be called from other processes.
   - The methods then call either `stopWifiDisplayScanInternal` directly or through a nested class reference (`DisplayManagerService.-$$Nest$mstopWifiDisplayScanInternal`), passing the PID. This internal method is likely responsible for the actual logic of stopping the Wi-Fi display scan.
   - Path 2 and Path 3 directly call `stopWifiDisplayScanInternal`, which implies that the critical operation (stopping the Wi-Fi display scan) is encapsulated within this internal method.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves calls to `stopWifiDisplayScanInternal` and `stopWifiDisplayScanLocked`. These methods are crucial as they represent the actual operations being performed by the `stopWifiDisplayScan` method.
   - The presence of `stopWifiDisplayScanLocked` suggests that there might be synchronization or locking involved, possibly to protect shared resources from concurrent access.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`startWifiDisplayScan()V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that starting a Wi-Fi display scan is considered a system or signature-protected operation.
   - The similarity in method names and the context (Wi-Fi display scan operations) suggests that stopping and starting such scans might require similar levels of access control, given their potential impact on system resources and functionality.

**Conclusion**:
Given the analysis above, the `stopWifiDisplayScan` method appears to be performing a system-level operation that could potentially affect how the device interacts with external displays. The fact that it involves internal methods that are likely protected (as inferred from similar APIs) and deals with process identity and synchronization suggests that it should not be freely accessible to all applications.

Therefore, considering the pattern of access control for similar operations (`startWifiDisplayScan`), it's reasonable to conclude that `stopWifiDisplayScan` should also have a restricted access level to prevent misuse or unauthorized access.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the method's potential impact on system functionality and its similarity to other system-protected operations.
