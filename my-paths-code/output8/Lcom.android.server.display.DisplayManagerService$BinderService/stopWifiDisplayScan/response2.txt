To determine the access control level for the `stopWifiDisplayScan` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are:

1. `startWifiDisplayScan()` - Access Control Level: `SYS_OR_SIG`
2. `disconnectWifiDisplay()` - Access Control Level: `NONE`
3. `forgetWifiDisplay(Ljava/lang/String;)V` - Access Control Level: `SYS_OR_SIG`
4. `pauseWifiDisplay()` - Access Control Level: `SYS_OR_SIG`
5. `connectWifiDisplay(Ljava/lang/String;)V` - Access Control Level: `SYS_OR_SIG`

The `stopWifiDisplayScan` method has a high similarity with `startWifiDisplayScan()`, `pauseWifiDisplay()`, `forgetWifiDisplay(Ljava/lang/String;)V`, and `connectWifiDisplay(Ljava/lang/String;)V`, all of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although `disconnectWifiDisplay()` has a lower similarity and an access control level of `NONE`, the majority of similar APIs suggest that `stopWifiDisplayScan` should have a more restrictive access control due to its interaction with sensitive display management functions.

Given the context that if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction, but since we're dealing with methods that manage and alter the state of WiFi displays (which can be considered sensitive operations), it's reasonable to assign a higher level of access control. The `stopWifiDisplayScan` method is involved in managing WiFi display scans, which could potentially impact device security or functionality if misused.

Therefore, considering the similarities and the nature of the operation performed by `stopWifiDisplayScan`, it should be assigned an access control level that reflects its potential to impact system security or functionality. The most appropriate access control level, given the provided information and the principle that writing data (or in this case, controlling WiFi display scans) usually poses a greater security risk than reading it, would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that only system or signature-protected applications can invoke this method, thereby protecting the device from potential misuse of WiFi display scan management capabilities.
