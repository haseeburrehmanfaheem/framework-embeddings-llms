To determine the access control level for the `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `shouldAlwaysRespectAppRequestedMode()Z`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `setRefreshRateSwitchingType(I)V`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `getColorMode()I`: NONE
   - `getLockTaskModeState()I`: NONE
   - `isAngleEnabled(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z`: SYS_OR_SIG

2. **Observations**:
   - The method `setRefreshRateSwitchingType(I)V` has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that modifying the refresh rate switching type requires system or signature-level permission.
   - The getter method in question, `getRefreshRateSwitchingType`, is related to `setRefreshRateSwitchingType`. Given that reading data (in this case, getting the refresh rate switching type) is generally less sensitive than writing it, we might expect a lower access control level for the getter compared to the setter.
   - However, considering the principle that if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level, and noting that `setRefreshRateSwitchingType` requires SYS_OR_SIG, it implies that `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` could also require a significant level of protection to maintain consistency in security posture.
   - Other similar APIs (`getColorMode()I`, `getLockTaskModeState()I`) have an access control level of NONE, but these do not directly relate to the sensitivity or system impact of display mode switching types.

3. **Decision**:
   Given that `setRefreshRateSwitchingType(I)V` requires SYS_OR_SIG and considering the principle of maintaining at least equal security for related getter and setter methods, we should assign a significant access control level to `getRefreshRateSwitchingType`. However, since reading is generally less sensitive than writing, and without explicit indications that reading this information poses a high risk (like in cases of very sensitive data), assigning the highest level might not be necessary unless explicitly required by system security policies or similar precedent.

Considering these points, but also acknowledging the general guideline that if a setter requires a certain access control level, the getter should at least have a comparable level to prevent information leakage that could facilitate unauthorized actions (e.g., knowing the current mode could help in planning an attack), we lean towards assigning a significant access control level. However, given the nature of this method and without explicit evidence suggesting it directly impacts system security or sensitive data, we must weigh against over-restricting access unnecessarily.

Given these considerations and the fact that similar methods related to display settings have been assigned SYS_OR_SIG for setters, which implies a need for protection but not necessarily at the highest level for getters unless explicitly justified by sensitivity or risk:

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
This decision reflects the importance of maintaining security consistency with related setter methods and acknowledging the potential system impact of display settings, even though the specific risks associated with reading this information might be considered lower than those of writing it.
