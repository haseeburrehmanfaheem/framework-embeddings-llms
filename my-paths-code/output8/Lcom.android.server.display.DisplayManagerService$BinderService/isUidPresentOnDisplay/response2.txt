To determine the access control level for the `isUidPresentOnDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Method Semantics**: The method checks if a given UID is present on a specific display. This operation involves querying the system about the presence of a user ID on a particular display, which can be considered as reading or querying system state rather than modifying it.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink codes provided involve internal method calls (`isUidPresentOnDisplayInternal`, `getDisplayAccessUIDs`) that suggest interaction with system-level data structures to determine the presence of a UID on a display.
   - These operations seem to be read-only, as they are checking or querying for information without any indication of modifying system state.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The provided similar API, `getDisplayInfo`, has an access control level of `NONE`. This method returns display information based on the input parameter, which is also a query operation.
   - The similarity in functionality (both methods are involved in querying system state without modifying it) suggests that their access control levels could be aligned.

4. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Given that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing, and considering that `isUidPresentOnDisplay` does not modify any system state but rather queries it, a lower restriction level can be justified.
   - If a getter method (like `isUidPresentOnDisplay`) is considered to require some level of access control due to the sensitivity of the information it returns, the corresponding principle would suggest that its access control should reflect the sensitivity and privacy implications of the data it accesses.

Based on these considerations:

- The operation performed by `isUidPresentOnDisplay` is a query that does not modify system state.
- Similar APIs (like `getDisplayInfo`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that querying system state for display-related information is not heavily restricted in this context.
- The method's functionality aligns with read-only operations, which typically require less stringent access controls compared to write or modify operations.

Therefore, considering the principles of access control in Android and the provided similar API's access level, the `isUidPresentOnDisplay` method would likely have an access control level that reflects its nature as a query operation without significant security or privacy implications.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This determination is based on the method's read-only nature and the precedent set by similar APIs with `NONE` access control levels, indicating that such query operations are not considered sensitive enough to warrant higher levels of restriction.
