To determine the access control level for the `isUidPresentOnDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, all of which involve checking if a UID is present on a display. This check is performed by interacting with internal methods or data structures like `mDisplayAccessUIDs`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with internal display management services and data structures. These interactions are about retrieving information related to display access for specific UIDs.

3. **Similar APIs**: The provided similar API, `getDisplayInfo(I)Landroid/view/DisplayInfo;`, has an access control level of `NONE`. This method is also related to display management, suggesting that operations related to querying or checking display-related information might not require strict access controls if they do not modify system state or reveal sensitive information.

Given these points:

- The `isUidPresentOnDisplay` method seems to be involved in querying the status of a UID on a display without any indication of modifying system state, accessing sensitive user data, or performing actions that could compromise system security.
- The similar API provided for comparison also operates within the realm of display information retrieval and has been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that such operations are considered safe in terms of access control.

Therefore, considering the nature of the method as a query operation related to display access without apparent risks to system integrity or user privacy, it would be reasonable to assign it a similar access control level as the provided comparable API.

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
