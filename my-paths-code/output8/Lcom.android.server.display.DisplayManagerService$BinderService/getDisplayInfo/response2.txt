To determine the access control level for the `getDisplayInfo` method in the `DisplayManagerService$BinderService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `getDisplayInfo` method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them involve retrieving display information based on the input parameter `p1`, which represents the display ID. The method also checks the calling UID's access to the display and whether the UID is present on the display internally.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. **reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync**: This method has a similarity of 0.8547736406326294 with `getDisplayInfo`. It uses `getDisplayInfo` from `DisplayManagerInternal` but has an access control level of NONE. However, this method's purpose and the context in which it accesses display information are different from directly getting display info.

2. **requestColorMode**: With a similarity of 0.816644012928009, this method interacts with the display settings by changing the color mode. It has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission, likely due to its ability to alter display settings.

3. **isMinimalPostProcessingRequested**: This method checks if minimal post-processing is requested for a display and has a similarity of 0.7702497243881226 with `getDisplayInfo`. It has an access control level of NONE, suggesting that reading this particular setting does not require elevated permissions.

4. **connectWifiDisplay**: Although it has a lower similarity (0.7442395091056824), this method connects to a WiFi display and requires SYS_OR_SIG access control. This is likely due to the security implications of connecting to external displays.

5. **getSystemPreferredDisplayMode**: With a similarity of 0.7372074723243713, this method retrieves the system's preferred display mode for a given display ID and has an access control level of NONE.

Considering these similarities and access control levels, `getDisplayInfo` seems to be more aligned with methods that require lower access control for reading information (like `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode` and `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested`) rather than those that modify settings or connect to external devices (like `requestColorMode` and `connectWifiDisplay`).

However, the method does involve checking the calling UID's access to the display (`v8.hasAccess(v1)`) and whether the UID is present on the display internally (`DisplayManagerService.isUidPresentOnDisplayInternal(v1, p1)`), which suggests some level of security consideration.

Given that reading display information (as in `getDisplayInfo`) is generally less sensitive than modifying display settings or connecting to external displays, but still involves some access control checks, it would be reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects the need for some permission but not at the system or signature level required for more sensitive operations.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the nature of the `getDisplayInfo` method, the most appropriate access control level seems to be NORMAL, as it reflects a balance between the need for some level of access control (due to the checks involved) and the relatively less sensitive nature of reading display information compared to modifying settings or connecting external devices.
