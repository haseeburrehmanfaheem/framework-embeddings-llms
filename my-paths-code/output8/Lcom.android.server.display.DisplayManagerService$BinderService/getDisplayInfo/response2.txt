To determine the access control level for the `getDisplayInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths (depths) but essentially performs similar operations - it retrieves display information based on a given parameter `p1`. It checks the calling UID and interacts with `LogicalDisplay` and `DisplayManagerService` to get the display info, considering frame rate overrides.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show how the method returns `DisplayInfo`, which involves getting display information from `LogicalDisplay` or through internal methods of `DisplayManagerService`.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two instances of `reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync` are provided with a high similarity score to `getDisplayInfo`. Both have an access control level of `NONE`.
   - These similar APIs also interact with display information, specifically getting display info from `mDisplayManagerInternal`.

Given this analysis:

- The method `getDisplayInfo` is primarily concerned with retrieving and returning display information based on the input parameter and the calling UID. It does not appear to perform any operations that would typically require elevated permissions (like modifying system settings, accessing sensitive user data directly, etc.).

- The similar APIs provided (`reportVirtualDisplayGeometryAsync`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that operations related to retrieving or reporting display geometry or information do not inherently require special permissions.

- The method's interaction with `Binder` to get the calling UID and its use of `LogicalDisplay` and `DisplayManagerService` methods suggest it is designed to work within the context of the Android system's display management, which includes considerations for security and access control. However, these interactions alone do not necessarily imply a need for a higher access control level without evidence of sensitive data exposure or system modification capabilities.

Based on this analysis, the `getDisplayInfo` method seems to be designed for retrieving information that is either publicly available or accessible based on the caller's identity (UID), without indications of requiring dangerous or signature-level permissions. Therefore, considering the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its operations, the access control level for `getDisplayInfo` would likely be `NONE`, as it does not seem to pose significant risks associated with higher levels of access control.
