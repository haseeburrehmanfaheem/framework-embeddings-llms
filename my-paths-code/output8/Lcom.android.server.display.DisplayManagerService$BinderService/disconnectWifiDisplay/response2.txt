Based on the provided information and similar APIs, we can analyze the access control level for the `disconnectWifiDisplay` method.

The similar APIs provided are all related to Wi-Fi display management, such as stopping scan, connecting, forgetting, pausing, and getting status. Most of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to execute.

The `disconnectWifiDisplay` method is likely to be a sensitive operation, as it involves disconnecting a Wi-Fi display, which could potentially impact the device's functionality and security. Given the similarities with other APIs in the same domain, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to this method.

However, we should also consider that the `getWifiDisplayStatus` method has an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that reading Wi-Fi display status information is not considered sensitive. This implies that the access control level for `disconnectWifiDisplay` might not need to be as restrictive as `SYS_OR_SIG` if it only involves disconnecting a display without modifying any sensitive data.

On the other hand, since `disconnectWifiDisplay` is a setter method (it modifies the state of the Wi-Fi display), its access control level should be at least as restrictive as the corresponding getter method (`getWifiDisplayStatus`). Given that most similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to assign this level to `disconnectWifiDisplay` to ensure consistency and security.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign the following access control level to the `disconnectWifiDisplay` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the method is protected with a suitable access control level, considering its sensitivity and similarity to other APIs in the same domain.
