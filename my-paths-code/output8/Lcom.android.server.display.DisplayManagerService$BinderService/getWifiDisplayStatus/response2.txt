To determine the access control level for the `getWifiDisplayStatus` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - All similar APIs (`pauseWifiDisplay`, `forgetWifiDisplay`, `connectWifiDisplay`, `startWifiDisplayScan`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` except for `disconnectWifiDisplay`, which has a level of `NONE`. 
   - The similarities in code and functionality between these methods and `getWifiDisplayStatus` suggest that they interact with the Wi-Fi display feature in various ways, including status retrieval, connection management, and scanning.

2. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, getter methods (which retrieve information) are considered less sensitive than setter methods (which modify data). Therefore, if a setter method requires a high level of access control, the corresponding getter might require a lower or similar level of access control.
   - The `getWifiDisplayStatus` method is a getter, retrieving the status of Wi-Fi displays. Given that most similar APIs (all of which are setters or involve actions that modify the state of Wi-Fi displays) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it suggests that these operations are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permissions.

3. **Specific Method Analysis**:
   - The `getWifiDisplayStatus` method itself does not modify any data but retrieves the current status. This operation is inherently less risky than modifying settings or initiating connections.
   - Despite this, considering the context of Wi-Fi display management and the access control levels assigned to similar APIs, it's reasonable to consider that retrieving the status might still require some level of permission to ensure that sensitive information is not freely accessible.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that all but one of the similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level and considering the principle that getter methods are generally less sensitive, it could be argued that `getWifiDisplayStatus` might require a lower or similar access control level.
   - However, since most related operations (which modify state) require `SYS_OR_SIG`, and given the importance of securing display management functions, assigning `NONE` seems too permissive for an operation that deals with system-level display settings.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `getWifiDisplayStatus`, balancing between security and the nature of the operation (retrieving status), would likely be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects a moderate level of access control, acknowledging that while retrieving display status is less sensitive than modifying it, some level of restriction is still warranted to protect system integrity and user privacy.
