To determine the access control level for the `getBrightnessInfo` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but they all involve retrieving a `BrightnessInfo` object based on an input parameter `p1`. If the object is not found (`v6 == 0`), it either returns a new `BrightnessInfo` object or null (depending on the path). This operation does not seem to modify any system settings directly but rather retrieves information.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code provided shows the retrieval of an object from a sparse array and, if the object is not found, creates a new `BrightnessInfo` object. This suggests that the method's primary purpose is to fetch or generate brightness information without directly altering system states that could pose significant security risks.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **setTemporaryBrightness(IF)V**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission because it sets a temporary brightness, which can be considered a modification of system settings.
   - **isUserRunning(I)Z**: Also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method checks if a user is running, which might require system-level permissions to accurately determine the current state of user sessions.

Given these points:

- The `getBrightnessInfo` method primarily retrieves information and does not directly modify system settings that could pose significant security risks.
- The similar APIs (`setTemporaryBrightness` and `isUserRunning`) involve either modifying system settings or require knowledge of system states, which is why they have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

However, since `getBrightnessInfo` is more about retrieving information rather than modifying system settings or requiring sensitive permissions to execute its primary function, it does not fit perfectly with the `SYS_OR_SIG` category based on the provided code snippets and similar APIs' logic.

Considering the method's purpose and comparing it with the given similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getBrightnessInfo` would be **NORMAL**. This is because it doesn't seem to pose significant risks or require system-level permissions to function, unlike the similar APIs provided which involve setting system properties or checking sensitive system states.
