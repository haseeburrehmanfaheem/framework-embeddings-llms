To determine the access control level for the `getBrightnessInfo` method, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs (`setTemporaryBrightness`, `isUserRunning`, and `setTemporaryAutoBrightnessAdjustment`) all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permission to execute.

However, it's crucial to note that the `getBrightnessInfo` method is a getter, which generally poses less risk than setter methods. The principle in Android access control suggests that if a setter method requires a certain level of access control, the corresponding getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading data is typically less sensitive than modifying it.

Given this context, and observing the code snippets provided for `getBrightnessInfo`, we see that this method retrieves brightness information based on the input parameter `p1`. The method does not modify any system settings or sensitive data; it merely returns existing information. This operation is inherently less risky than setting temporary brightness or auto-brightness adjustments, which could potentially impact system performance or user experience.

Despite the similarities with APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, the nature of `getBrightnessInfo` as a getter method suggests it may not require such a high level of restriction. However, considering the sensitive nature of display settings and the potential for this information to be used in ways that could impact system security or user privacy, assigning an access control level of `NONE` might be too permissive.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `getBrightnessInfo` would likely be `NORMAL`. This level acknowledges the method's role in accessing system information without unnecessarily elevating its permission requirements to those of more sensitive operations like setting display properties.
