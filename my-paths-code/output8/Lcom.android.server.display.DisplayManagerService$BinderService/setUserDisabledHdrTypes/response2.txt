To determine the access control level for the `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve checking or setting user-disabled HDR types. This operation seems related to display settings, which could be considered a system-level configuration.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves checks for subsets of HDR types and sorting or comparing arrays of HDR types. These operations are low-level and do not directly imply a dangerous or normal access control level based on their functionality alone.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed(Z)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to user-disabled HDR types are considered system or signature protected, likely because they involve modifying system settings that could affect the behavior of the display subsystem.

Given these points:

- **Similarity with System-Level Operations**: The operation of setting user-disabled HDR types is similar to other system-level operations (like `setAreUserDisabledHdrTypesAllowed`) which have been classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that modifying such settings requires either system-level privileges or a specific signature, indicating it's not a simple `NONE` or `NORMAL` access control level.

- **Potential Impact**: Changing display settings could potentially impact the system's behavior and user experience. Thus, it might require protection against unauthorized changes, aligning with a more restrictive access control level.

- **Lack of Indication for Dangerous**: There is no clear indication that this method deals with sensitive user data or dangerous operations (like those involving financial transactions, personal data, etc.) that would warrant a `DANGEROUS` access control level.

Based on the analysis and considering the similarity with other APIs that have been classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that the `setUserDisabledHdrTypes` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because it involves system-level configuration changes related to display settings, which are likely protected against unauthorized modifications.
