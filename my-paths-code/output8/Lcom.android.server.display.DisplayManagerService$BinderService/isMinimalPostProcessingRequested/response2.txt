To determine the access control level for the `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with different implementations but both seem to be related to retrieving a display-related property (`mRequestedMinimalPostProcessing` or `getRequestedMinimalPostProcessingLocked()`). This suggests that the method is involved in managing or querying display settings.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with `LogicalDisplay` objects, specifically getting displays by ID and then accessing their properties. This interaction is typical for methods that need to query or modify display settings.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getDisplayInfo(I)Landroid/view/DisplayInfo;**: This API has a similarity score of 0.7702498435974121 and an access control level of `NONE`. It interacts with `LogicalDisplay` objects to retrieve display information, which is somewhat similar to what `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` does, but it doesn't modify any settings.
   - **requestColorMode(II)V**: With a similarity score of 0.754281759262085, this API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It modifies the requested color mode of a display, which implies a need for higher privileges to change system settings.

Given these points:

- The method `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` is primarily involved in querying a property related to display post-processing. This operation does not modify system settings but rather retrieves information.
- The similarity with `getDisplayInfo(I)Landroid/view/DisplayInfo;`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, suggests that querying display properties might not require high-level permissions.
- However, considering the method's interaction with system components (like `LogicalDisplay`) and its potential impact on how the system manages displays, it might still require some form of access control.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` seems to be `NORMAL`. This is because while it doesn't modify system settings like `requestColorMode(II)V` does (which requires `SYS_OR_SIG`), it's also not as freely accessible as operations that don't interact with system components or settings, thus not fitting perfectly into the `NONE` category.
