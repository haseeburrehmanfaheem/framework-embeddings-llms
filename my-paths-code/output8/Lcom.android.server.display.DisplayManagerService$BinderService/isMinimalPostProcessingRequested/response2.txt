To determine the access control level for the `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of the Method**: The `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` method has two paths:
   - Path 1 returns a boolean value directly from the object's field `mRequestedMinimalPostProcessing` without any additional operations or checks.
   - Path 2 involves getting a `LogicalDisplay` object based on the input parameter and then retrieving a boolean value indicating whether minimal post-processing is requested for that display.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **getDisplayInfo**: This method has an access control level of `NONE`. It retrieves information about a display, which is generally considered less sensitive than modifying settings or accessing potentially secure information.
   - **requestColorMode**: This method requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control. It modifies the color mode of a display, which could be considered more sensitive as it involves changing system settings.
   - **getSystemPreferredDisplayMode** and **getUserPreferredDisplayMode**: Both have an access control level of `NONE`. They are getter methods that retrieve preferred display modes, which is less sensitive information.

3. **Determining Access Control Level**:
   - Given that the `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` method is a getter method and does not modify any system settings but rather retrieves information about whether minimal post-processing is requested for a display, it aligns more closely with the behavior of `getDisplayInfo`, `getSystemPreferredDisplayMode`, and `getUserPreferredDisplayMode`.
   - The method's primary purpose is to retrieve a boolean value indicating a setting or state related to display processing. This kind of information retrieval is generally not as sensitive as modifying settings (like in `requestColorMode`).
   - Therefore, considering the principle that reading data is less sensitive than writing it and comparing with similar APIs provided, the access control level for `isMinimalPostProcessingRequested` should be `NONE`, as it does not involve sensitive operations or modifications to system settings.

**Final Access Control Level**:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's nature as a getter, its similarity to other APIs with `NONE` access control that also retrieve display-related information without modifying system settings, and the general principle of Android access control where reading data is considered less sensitive than writing it.
