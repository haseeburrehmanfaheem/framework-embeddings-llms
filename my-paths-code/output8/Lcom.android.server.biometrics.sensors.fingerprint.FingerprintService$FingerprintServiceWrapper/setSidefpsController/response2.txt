To determine the access control level for the `setSidefpsController` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The `setSidefpsController` method has a high similarity (0.7919524908065796) with the `setUdfpsOverlayController` method, which has an access control level of NORMAL. This suggests that `setSidefpsController` might also require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, other methods like `remove`, `rename` have an access control level of NORMAL, indicating that they are not highly sensitive operations.

However, methods like `cancelAuthentication` and `cancelFingerprintDetect` have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require a higher level of access control due to their sensitive nature.

Considering the similarities and the semantics of the `setSidefpsController` method, it appears to be more closely related to the methods with NORMAL access control levels. The method is setting a controller for side FPS, which seems to be a configuration or setup operation rather than a highly sensitive authentication or authorization operation.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of NORMAL to the `setSidefpsController` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
