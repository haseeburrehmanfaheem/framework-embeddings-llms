Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `remove` method in the `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` class.

The `remove` method has a high similarity with other methods in the same class, such as `enroll`, `cancelEnrollment`, and `cancelFingerprintDetect`, which all have an access control level of `NORMAL`. Additionally, the similar API `remove` in the `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` class also has an access control level of `NORMAL`.

The method's functionality is related to removing a fingerprint, which is a relatively sensitive operation. However, considering the similarities with other methods and the fact that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, I will assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `remove` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs. If more context or information becomes available, this decision may be revised.
