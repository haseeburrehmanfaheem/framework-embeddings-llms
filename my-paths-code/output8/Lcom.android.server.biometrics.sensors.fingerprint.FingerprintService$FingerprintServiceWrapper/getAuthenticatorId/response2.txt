To determine the access control level for the `getAuthenticatorId` method in the `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `getAuthenticatorId` method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately call the `getAuthenticatorId` method on a `ServiceProvider` object. This suggests that the method is primarily used to retrieve an authenticator ID from a service provider.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NORMAL`. These APIs include:

* `getSensorProperties` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`
* `invalidateAuthenticatorId` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper`
* `cancelAuthenticationFromService` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper`
* `prepareForAuthentication` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`
* `startPreparedClient` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper`

All of these APIs have similarities with the `getAuthenticatorId` method, such as interacting with service providers and performing biometric-related operations. Given that they all have a `NORMAL` access control level, it is reasonable to infer that the `getAuthenticatorId` method should also have a `NORMAL` access control level.

Additionally, considering the principle that reading data (in this case, retrieving an authenticator ID) is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and given that the similar APIs with write operations (e.g., `invalidateAuthenticatorId`) are classified as `NORMAL`, it further supports the conclusion that `getAuthenticatorId` should be classified as `NORMAL`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, the access control level for the `getAuthenticatorId` method should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
