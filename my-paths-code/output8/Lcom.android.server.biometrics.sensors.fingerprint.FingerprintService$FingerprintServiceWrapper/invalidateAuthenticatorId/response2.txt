Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will analyze the `invalidateAuthenticatorId` method to determine its appropriate access control level.

The `invalidateAuthenticatorId` method appears to be related to biometric authentication and interacts with a `ServiceProvider` to schedule an invalidation of an authenticator ID. The method takes three parameters: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are likely related to the sensor, timeout, and callback, respectively.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NORMAL`. These APIs also interact with a `ServiceProvider` and perform various operations such as canceling authentication, getting an authenticator ID, resetting lockout, revoking a challenge, and preparing for authentication. The similarities in code structure and functionality suggest that the `invalidateAuthenticatorId` method is likely to require a similar level of access control.

Considering the semantics of the `invalidateAuthenticatorId` method and its interactions with the `ServiceProvider`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This level of access control is consistent with the other similar APIs provided, which also perform operations related to biometric authentication and interact with a `ServiceProvider`.

In Android, if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction. However, in this case, since the `invalidateAuthenticatorId` method is not a getter method, we do not need to consider the access control level of a corresponding getter method.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the similarities with other APIs, I conclude that the `invalidateAuthenticatorId` method should have an access control level of `NORMAL`.
