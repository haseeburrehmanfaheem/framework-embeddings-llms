To determine the access control level for the `removeAll` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method interacts with `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper$2`, which suggests it's handling fingerprint-related operations.
   - It iterates over service providers and sensor properties, scheduling a removal operation (`scheduleRemoveAll`) on each sensor found.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves creating a new instance of `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper$2` and calling `scheduleRemoveAll` on a sensor object.
   - This indicates that the method is directly interacting with fingerprint sensors to remove data or configurations.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`remove` and `removeAll` for face service) have an access control level of `NORMAL`.
   - These APIs also interact with biometric services (fingerprint and face), scheduling removal operations on sensors.
   - The similarity in purpose (removal operations related to biometric data) and the fact that they all deal with sensitive user data suggest a consistent access control approach.

Given these points, assigning an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `removeAll` method seems appropriate. This is because:
- The method deals with sensitive user data (fingerprint information), which requires some level of protection.
- However, it does not appear to perform actions that would be classified as `DANGEROUS` (e.g., directly accessing or modifying critical system settings without user consent) or `SYS_OR_SIG` (which typically involves system-level operations requiring signature or system permissions).
- The similarity with other APIs that have a `NORMAL` access control level suggests consistency in handling biometric data removal operations.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
