Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `removeAll` method in the `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` class.

The `removeAll` method is used to remove all fingerprints from a sensor, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper authorization. The method takes several parameters, including an `IBinder` token, a user ID, a receiver, and a string parameter.

Analyzing the similar APIs provided, we can see that most of them have an access control level of `NORMAL`. These APIs include:

* `remove(Landroid/os/IBinder;IILandroid/hardware/fingerprint/IFingerprintServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;)V` in the same class
* `removeAll(Landroid/os/IBinder;ILandroid/hardware/face/IFaceServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;)V` in a different class, but with similar functionality
* `enroll(Landroid/os/IBinder;[BILandroid/hardware/fingerprint/IFingerprintServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;I)J`
* `resetLockout(Landroid/os/IBinder;II[BLjava/lang/String;)V`
* `hasEnrolledFingerprints(IILjava/lang/String;)Z`

All of these APIs have a similarity score above 0.7, indicating that they are quite similar to the `removeAll` method in terms of functionality and parameters.

Given this information, I would conclude that the `removeAll` method should also have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This is because the method is performing a sensitive operation that requires proper authorization, but it is not as sensitive as operations that require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This access control level ensures that the `removeAll` method can only be called by authorized components, while also allowing for flexibility and usability in various scenarios.
