Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `prepareForAuthentication` method.

The similar APIs all have an access control level of `NORMAL`, which suggests that this level of access control is suitable for methods related to biometric authentication. The `prepareForAuthentication` method is also related to biometric authentication, as it prepares the service for authentication.

Additionally, the method does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it only prepares the service for authentication and does not perform any sensitive operations itself. Therefore, an access control level of `NORMAL` seems appropriate for this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity between the `prepareForAuthentication` method and the other APIs provided, as well as the relatively low security risk posed by this method.
