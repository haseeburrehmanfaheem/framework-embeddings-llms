Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `cancelAuthenticationFromService` method.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NORMAL`, which suggests that they are not highly sensitive or restricted. The `cancelAuthenticationFromService` method seems to be related to biometric authentication and is canceling an ongoing authentication process. This operation does not appear to be highly sensitive or pose a significant security risk.

Considering the principles mentioned earlier, if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction. However, in this case, we are dealing with a method that is canceling an ongoing authentication process, which can be considered a "setter" operation.

Given the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels, I would conclude that the `cancelAuthenticationFromService` method should have an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
