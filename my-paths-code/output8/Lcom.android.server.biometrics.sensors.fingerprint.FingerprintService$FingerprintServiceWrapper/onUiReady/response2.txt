To determine the access control level for the `onUiReady` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code paths for `onUiReady` all lead to calling `onUiReady` on a `ServiceProvider` instance. This suggests that the method is designed to delegate its functionality to a specific service provider based on the input parameters (`p1` and `p2`). The logic for selecting the service provider varies across the paths but ultimately aims to find an appropriate provider that can handle the request.

The sink code snippets provided also indicate interactions with `ServiceProvider` instances, specifically calling `onUiReady` on them after obtaining a reference through various means (e.g., iteration, direct retrieval).

Given these observations, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. **startPreparedClient(II)V**: This API has an access control level of NORMAL. Its code snippet shows a direct call to `startPreparedClient` on a `ServiceProvider` instance obtained via `FingerprintService.-$$Nest$mgetProviderForSensor`. The similarity in structure and the fact that it also interacts with a `ServiceProvider` suggests that `onUiReady` might share similar access control considerations.

2. **onPointerDown(JIIIFF)V**: Also classified as NORMAL, this API's code involves calling `onPointerDown` on a `ServiceProvider` instance retrieved similarly to the first example. The interaction pattern with `ServiceProvider` instances is consistent across these examples.

Considering the similarities in how these APIs interact with `ServiceProvider` instances and delegate their functionality, it's reasonable to infer that `onUiReady` would have a comparable access control level. Since both similar APIs are classified as NORMAL, and given the nature of `onUiReady`'s interactions with service providers, it suggests that `onUiReady` should also be considered NORMAL in terms of access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis of code paths, sink code, and similarities with other APIs, the final access control level for the `onUiReady` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
