Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `onUiReady` method.

The `onUiReady` method has a similarity score ranging from 0.824 to 0.878 with other APIs in the same class, which suggests that it shares similar functionality and characteristics with these APIs. All of the similar APIs have an access control level of `NORMAL`, indicating that they do not require strict access controls.

The sink code entries for the `onUiReady` method also show a pattern of calling `getProviderForSensor` to retrieve a `ServiceProvider` instance, which is then used to call the `onUiReady` method. This pattern is consistent with the similar APIs, further supporting the assignment of an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Therefore, based on the similarity scores and the consistent pattern in the sink code entries, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `onUiReady` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
