Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getSensorProperties` method.

The similar APIs provided have a high similarity score (above 0.85) and all have an access control level of `NORMAL`. These APIs interact with the same sinks, such as `ServiceProvider`, and have similar semantics, including getting properties or performing actions related to biometric sensors.

Given that the `getSensorProperties` method is a getter method, which is generally less sensitive than a setter method, and considering the similarities with other APIs, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the similar APIs have a consistent access control level of `NORMAL`, and the `getSensorProperties` method has a similar purpose and interacts with the same sinks. Additionally, as a getter method, it is less sensitive than a setter method, which further supports the assignment of an access control level of `NORMAL`.
