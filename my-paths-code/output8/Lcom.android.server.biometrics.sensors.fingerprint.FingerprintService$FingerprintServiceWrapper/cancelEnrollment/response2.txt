To determine the access control level for the `cancelEnrollment` method in the `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The `cancelEnrollment` method has similarities with other biometric service methods such as `cancelAuthentication`, `cancelFaceDetect`, `cancelFingerprintDetect`, `enroll`, and `remove`. These similarities are based on their code structure and the operations they perform, which involve interacting with biometric sensors and managing biometric data.

2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**:
   - `cancelAuthentication` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`: NORMAL
   - `cancelFaceDetect` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `cancelFingerprintDetect` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `enroll` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`: NORMAL
   - `remove` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`: NORMAL

3. **Analysis**:
   - The method `cancelEnrollment` is related to managing the enrollment process of fingerprints, which involves sensitive user data.
   - Given that `cancelAuthentication`, `enroll`, and `remove` have a NORMAL access control level, it suggests that operations directly related to the management of biometric data (like enrolling or removing biometric templates) are considered to require a moderate level of protection.
   - However, `cancelFaceDetect` and `cancelFingerprintDetect` have a SYS_OR_SIG access control level, indicating that certain operations related to detecting biometrics might require higher security clearance, possibly due to the nature of the operation (e.g., immediate cancellation of an ongoing detection process).
   - Considering the similarities in code structure and the nature of the operation (`cancelEnrollment` being closely related to managing biometric data enrollment), it's reasonable to infer that `cancelEnrollment` would likely require a similar level of protection as other methods that manage or alter biometric data.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the analysis above, especially considering the similarities with other APIs and their access control levels, `cancelEnrollment` seems to be more closely aligned with operations that require a moderate level of security, such as managing enrollment data. Therefore, assigning an access control level of NORMAL seems appropriate, as it reflects the need for protection of user biometric data without requiring the highest level of system or signature permissions.
