Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will analyze the access control level for the `getSensorPropertiesInternal` method.

The method is a getter, which generally has less restrictive access control than setter methods. The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NORMAL`, with one exception being `SYS_OR_SIG` for the `cancelFaceDetect` method. However, this exception can be ignored as it's a different type of method (cancellation) and its access control level is likely due to specific security requirements.

The `getSensorPropertiesInternal` method returns a list of sensor properties, which is not typically sensitive information. The similar APIs, such as `getFeature`, `isHardwareDetected`, and `getSensorProperties`, also have `NORMAL` access control levels, suggesting that reading sensor properties or detecting hardware does not require high-level access control.

Considering the above points, I conclude that the `getSensorPropertiesInternal` method should have a `NORMAL` access control level.
