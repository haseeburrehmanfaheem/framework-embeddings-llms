To determine the access control level for the `hasEnrolledFingerprints` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

The provided similar APIs (`startPreparedClient`, `getSensorProperties`, `getAuthenticatorId`, `resetLockout`, and `isHardwareDetected`) all have an access control level of `NORMAL`. These methods interact with fingerprint sensor properties, authentication, and hardware detection, which are related to the functionality of `hasEnrolledFingerprints`.

Given that `hasEnrolledFingerprints` checks if there are enrolled fingerprints for a given user and sensor, this operation is essentially a read operation. It does not modify any sensitive data but rather retrieves information about the existence of enrolled fingerprints.

Considering the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and all similar APIs provided have a `NORMAL` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that `hasEnrolledFingerprints` should also have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This aligns with the general approach to securing data access in Android, where read operations typically require less stringent access controls compared to write or modify operations.

Therefore, based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `hasEnrolledFingerprints` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
