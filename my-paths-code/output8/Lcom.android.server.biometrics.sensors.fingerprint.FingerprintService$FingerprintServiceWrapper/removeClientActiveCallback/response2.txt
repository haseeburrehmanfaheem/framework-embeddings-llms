To determine the access control level for the `removeClientActiveCallback` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `addClientActiveCallback`: NORMAL
   - `unregisterListener`: NONE
   - `unregisterShortcutChangeCallback`: NONE
   - `removeListener`: NORMAL
   - `unregisterCallback`: NONE

2. **Semantics of the Method**:
   - The method `removeClientActiveCallback` is used to remove a callback related to fingerprint client activity. This operation involves modifying (removing) an existing registration or listener, which typically does not pose as significant a security risk as adding or setting new callbacks but still involves altering system state.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code for `removeClientActiveCallback` involves removing a callback from a list (`this.mClientActiveCallbacks.remove(p1)`) and notifying a dispatcher (`v3.removeCallback(p1)`), which are operations similar to those found in the provided similar APIs.

4. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, setter methods (or methods that modify state) require at least a NORMAL access control level because they can alter system behavior or data.
   - Getter methods typically require less stringent access controls since they only read data.
   - If a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should have an equal or higher access control level.

Given these considerations:

- The `removeClientActiveCallback` method modifies system state by removing callbacks, which suggests it should not be entirely open (NONE) to prevent unauthorized removal of callbacks that might be critical for system functionality or security.
- The similarity with `addClientActiveCallback` (NORMAL) and `removeListener` (NORMAL) suggests that modifying callback registrations could require a moderate level of access control to ensure only authorized components can alter these settings.
- However, the method's purpose is to remove existing callbacks, which might not be as sensitive as adding new ones but still requires some level of control.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's functionality and the principles outlined, assigning an access control level of **NORMAL** seems appropriate. This ensures that the removal of client active callbacks is controlled and only allowed by components with the necessary permissions or clearance, balancing security with the need for legitimate system modifications.
