Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `revokeChallenge` method.

The `revokeChallenge` method has a high similarity with other methods that have an access control level of `NORMAL`. These methods include:

* `generateChallenge` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` (similarity: 0.9359691739082336)
* `generateChallenge` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` (similarity: 0.8995612263679504)
* `resetLockout` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` (similarity: 0.8868187069892883)
* `cancelAuthenticationFromService` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` (similarity: 0.8779996633529663)
* `invalidateAuthenticatorId` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` (similarity: 0.8756496906280518)

All of these methods have an access control level of `NORMAL`, which suggests that the `revokeChallenge` method should also have a similar access control level.

Additionally, the sink code entries for the `revokeChallenge` method are similar to those of the other methods with an access control level of `NORMAL`. The method calls `scheduleRevokeChallenge` on a `ServiceProvider` object, which is similar to the method calls in the other methods.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other methods and the analysis of the sink code entries, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `revokeChallenge` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
