Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `requestState` method.

The `requestState` method has similarities with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs include:

* `cancelStateRequest()` in `Lcom.android.server.devicestate.DeviceStateManagerService$BinderService`
* `requestAd(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/media/tv/AdRequest;I)V` in `Lcom.android.server.tv.TvInputManagerService$BinderService`
* `setVolume(Landroid/os/IBinder;FI)V` in `Lcom.android.server.tv.TvInputManagerService$BinderService`
* `notifySignalStrength(Landroid/os/IBinder;II)V` in `Lcom.android.server.tv.interactive.TvInteractiveAppManagerService$BinderService`
* `notifyTuned(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/net/Uri;I)V` in `Lcom.android.server.tv.interactive.TvInteractiveAppManagerService$BinderService`

All of these APIs have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

The `requestState` method also interacts with the `DeviceStateManagerService` and `OverrideRequestController`, which are similar to the components interacted with by the other APIs. Additionally, the method uses `Binder.getCallingPid()` to get the calling process ID, which is a common pattern in Android APIs that require system or signature-level permissions.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `requestState` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
