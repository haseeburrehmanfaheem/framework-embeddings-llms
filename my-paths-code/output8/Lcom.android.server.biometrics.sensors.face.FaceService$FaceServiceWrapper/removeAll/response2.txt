To determine the access control level for the `removeAll` method in the `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` class, we need to analyze the provided information, including the code snippets of the method and its similar APIs, along with their assigned access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `removeAll` method iterates through a list of service providers and schedules the removal of all faces for each provider. This operation involves modifying data related to biometric face recognition, which can be considered sensitive.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **API 1: `removeAll` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper`**: This API has a similarity of 0.7890545725822449 and is assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. It performs a similar operation but for fingerprint recognition.
   - **API 2: `cancelFaceDetect` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`**: With a similarity of 0.7814755439758301, this API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission. However, its functionality is somewhat different as it cancels face detection rather than removing faces.
   - **API 3: `setFeature` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`**: Having a similarity of 0.7653645873069763 and an access control level of `NORMAL`, this API sets features for face recognition, which involves modifying settings but is not directly related to removing faces.
   - **API 4: `remove` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`**: With a similarity of 0.7600985765457153 and an access control level of `NORMAL`, this method removes a single face, which is closely related to the operation performed by `removeAll`.
   - **API 5: `getFeature` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`**: This API has a similarity of 0.7478848695755005 and an access control level of `NORMAL`. It retrieves features for face recognition, which is a read operation and generally less sensitive than write or modify operations.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that the `removeAll` method modifies sensitive biometric data (faces), it requires a certain level of protection.
   - The majority of similar APIs (`removeAll` in `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper`, `setFeature`, `remove`, and `getFeature` in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper`) have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This suggests that operations related to modifying or accessing biometric data are typically considered to require normal permission.
   - The exception, `cancelFaceDetect`, requires `SYS_OR_SIG` permission, but its functionality and sensitivity might differ from the `removeAll` method.

Based on this analysis, assigning an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `removeAll` method in `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` seems appropriate. This is because it aligns with the protection levels assigned to similar methods that modify or interact with biometric data, reflecting a balance between security and usability for face recognition services.
