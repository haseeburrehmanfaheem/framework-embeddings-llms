Based on the provided information, I will analyze the given API and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `getLockoutModeForUser` method is a getter method that retrieves the lockout mode for a specific user. The method iterates through service providers and checks if they contain a sensor with the specified ID. If a provider is found, it calls the `getLockoutModeForUser` method on that provider to retrieve the lockout mode.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NORMAL`. These APIs include:

* `resetLockout`: Resets the lockout mode for a specific user.
* `getAuthenticatorId`: Retrieves the authenticator ID for a specific user.
* `cancelAuthenticationFromService`: Cancels an ongoing authentication request.
* `getSensorProperties`: Retrieves sensor properties for a specific sensor.
* `isHardwareDetected`: Checks if hardware is detected for a specific sensor.

All of these APIs have similarities with the `getLockoutModeForUser` method in terms of their functionality and the way they interact with service providers. They all require access to sensitive information, such as user data or sensor properties, but do not pose a significant security risk.

Considering the similarities between the `getLockoutModeForUser` method and the provided APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `getLockoutModeForUser` method should be `NORMAL`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This access control level reflects the fact that the `getLockoutModeForUser` method requires access to sensitive information, but does not pose a significant security risk. It is consistent with the access control levels of the similar APIs provided.
