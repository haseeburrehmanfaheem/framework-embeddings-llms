Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will analyze the `cancelFaceDetect` method to determine its access control level.

The `cancelFaceDetect` method has three paths with different depths, and all of them interact with the same sink code entries. The sink code entries involve getting a single provider or iterating over service providers to cancel face detection.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NORMAL`, which suggests that they are not sensitive operations that require high-level access control. These APIs include `cancelEnrollment`, `cancelAuthentication`, `setFeature`, `remove`, and `enroll`, all of which are related to biometric authentication and face recognition.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `cancelFaceDetect` method, it is likely that the access control level for `cancelFaceDetect` should be similar. Since reading data (in this case, canceling face detection) is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and the corresponding getter methods do not necessarily need the same level of restriction as the setter methods, I will assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `cancelFaceDetect` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment is based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, as well as the consideration of the sensitivity of the operation performed by the `cancelFaceDetect` method.
