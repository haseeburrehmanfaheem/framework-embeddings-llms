To determine the access control level for the `cancelFaceDetect` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code paths for `cancelFaceDetect` involve interactions with face detection services, checking package names, and canceling face detect operations through service providers. The sink code snippets show how the API interacts with these services, specifically calling `cancelFaceDetect` on a service provider after obtaining it through various means (e.g., `getSingleProvider`, iterating over `mServiceProviders`).

Given that the similar APIs (`cancelEnrollment` and `cancelAuthentication`) have an access control level of `NORMAL`, we can infer several key points:

1. **Similarity in Purpose**: All these methods (`cancelFaceDetect`, `cancelEnrollment`, `cancelAuthentication`) seem to be related to managing or canceling operations related to face recognition or authentication, which suggests they might require similar levels of access control.

2. **Code Structure and Sinks**: The code paths for `cancelFaceDetect` and the provided sink code snippets indicate interactions with system services that are likely protected but do not necessarily imply a need for dangerous or system/signature-level permissions based on the information given. The interaction patterns (obtaining service providers and calling methods on them) are similar to those in the comparison APIs.

3. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both `cancelEnrollment` and `cancelAuthentication` have been assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. This suggests that operations related to face recognition or authentication management do not inherently require the highest levels of permission (like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`) but still need some form of access control, hence `NORMAL`.

Considering these points and without explicit indications that `cancelFaceDetect` requires more sensitive permissions than its similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `cancelFaceDetect` should also have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege, where an API is assigned the lowest level of access control necessary for it to function properly, based on its similarities with other known APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `cancelFaceDetect` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
