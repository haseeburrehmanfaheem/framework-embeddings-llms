Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `getSensorPropertiesInternal` API.

The `getSensorPropertiesInternal` API is a getter method that returns a list of sensor properties. The similar APIs provided have access control levels ranging from NORMAL to SYS_OR_SIG. However, most of the similar APIs have a NORMAL access control level.

Considering the semantics of the `getSensorPropertiesInternal` API and the fact that it is a getter method, which is generally less sensitive than a setter method, I would assign an access control level of NORMAL to this API.

The reason for choosing NORMAL over NONE is that the API is still interacting with sensitive sensor properties, and some level of access control is necessary to prevent unauthorized access. On the other hand, SYS_OR_SIG seems too restrictive for a getter method, as it requires system or signature-level permission, which may not be necessary for reading sensor properties.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similar APIs, I assign an access control level of NORMAL to the `getSensorPropertiesInternal` API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
