To determine the access control level for the `hasEnrolledFaces` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs. The method checks if there are enrolled faces for a given sensor and user.

1. **Behavior Analysis**: The `hasEnrolledFaces` method iterates through service providers to find one that contains the specified sensor. Once found, it retrieves the list of enrolled faces for the given user and sensor. If the list is not empty, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This operation involves reading data (enrolled faces) from a specific sensor for a particular user.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - All similar APIs provided (`resetLockout`, `getSensorProperties`, `startPreparedClient`, `getAuthenticatorId`, and `enroll`) have an access control level of `NORMAL`. 
   - These methods interact with biometric sensors (face or fingerprint) for various operations such as resetting lockouts, getting sensor properties, starting prepared clients, retrieving authenticator IDs, and enrolling new biometric data.
   - The common theme among these APIs is that they either read from or write to sensitive biometric data, which requires a moderate level of access control.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Given that `hasEnrolledFaces` reads data (enrolled faces) without modifying it, its required access control level should be at least as restrictive as the similar APIs that also handle sensitive data.
   - Since reading enrolled face data is less sensitive than enrolling new faces or resetting lockouts but still involves accessing user-specific biometric information, a `NORMAL` access control level seems appropriate.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the behavior of `hasEnrolledFaces`, its similarity to other APIs with `NORMAL` access control levels, and considering that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing it, the most suitable access control level for this method would be `NORMAL`.
