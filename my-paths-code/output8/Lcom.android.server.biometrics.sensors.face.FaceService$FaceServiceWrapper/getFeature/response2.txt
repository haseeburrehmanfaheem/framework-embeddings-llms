To determine the access control level for the `getFeature` method in the `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` class, we need to analyze the provided information, including the code snippets of the method and its similar APIs along with their access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getFeature` method involves retrieving sensor properties and scheduling a get feature operation on a face service provider. This operation seems to be related to biometric authentication, specifically face recognition, which is a sensitive functionality but primarily focused on reading or querying capabilities rather than modifying system settings or user data directly.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `setFeature` method has an access control level of `NORMAL`. Since setting features typically involves more risk (e.g., modifying sensor configurations) than getting features, it's reasonable that `getFeature` could have a similar or less restrictive access control level.
   - The `cancelFaceDetect`, `getSensorPropertiesInternal`, and other methods provide context on how different operations within the biometric service are secured. Notably, `SYS_OR_SIG` is assigned to operations that either require system-level privileges or are highly sensitive. However, these do not directly influence the access control of `getFeature` unless they share similar risks or operational impacts.
   - The `enroll` and `remove` methods also have an access control level of `NORMAL`, indicating that operations related to biometric data management are considered to require a standard level of security.

3. **Access Control Principles**: 
   - If a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level because writing data usually poses a greater security risk than reading it.
   - Given that `getFeature` seems less risky compared to operations like `setFeature`, and considering the context provided by similar APIs, we can infer its appropriate access control level.

Based on these considerations, since `getFeature` is involved in querying or retrieving information rather than modifying system settings or user data, and given the access control levels of similar APIs (especially `setFeature` with `NORMAL` access control), it's reasonable to conclude that `getFeature` should have an access control level that reflects its operational risk.

Therefore, considering the principles of access control in Android and the provided context:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice aligns with the access control levels assigned to similar methods that manage biometric data and operations, reflecting a balanced approach between security and functionality.
