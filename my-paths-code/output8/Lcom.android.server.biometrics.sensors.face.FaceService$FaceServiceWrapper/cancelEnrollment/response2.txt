To determine the access control level for the `cancelEnrollment` method in the `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similarity and Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**:
   - The most similar APIs (`cancelAuthentication`, `cancelFaceDetect`, `cancelFingerprintDetect`) have access control levels of `NORMAL` and `SYS_OR_SIG`. 
   - `enroll` and `remove` methods, which are also related to biometric operations, have an access control level of `NORMAL`.

2. **Semantics of the APIs**:
   - The `cancelEnrollment` method is used to cancel an ongoing enrollment process. This operation does not seem to pose a significant security risk since it's about stopping a process rather than accessing or modifying sensitive data directly.
   - However, considering the context of biometric data and operations, even cancellation might require some level of access control to prevent unauthorized interruptions.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - If a setter method (which modifies state) requires access control, the related getter method (which reads state) does not necessarily need the same level of restriction.
   - Given that `cancelEnrollment` is more about modifying the state of an ongoing process rather than reading sensitive data, it might require some form of access control.

Considering these points:

- The similar APIs (`cancelAuthentication`, `cancelFaceDetect`, `cancelFingerprintDetect`) suggest that biometric-related cancellation operations could have varying levels of access control (`NORMAL` or `SYS_OR_SIG`).
- Given the nature of `cancelEnrollment` as a method that stops an ongoing process and considering it's part of biometric services, which generally require some level of security, assigning it a `NORMAL` access control level seems reasonable. This is because it doesn't directly read or write sensitive data but still operates within a context that requires authorization.

Therefore, based on the analysis and considering the need for some form of access control in biometric operations without posing direct risks similar to those of reading/writing sensitive data, the `cancelEnrollment` method should have an access control level that reflects its operational nature and security requirements.
