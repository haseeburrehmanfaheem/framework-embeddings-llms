Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `invalidateAuthenticatorId` method.

The method `invalidateAuthenticatorId` has a high similarity with other methods that have been assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. These methods include:

* `cancelAuthenticationFromService`
* `getAuthenticatorId`
* `resetLockout`
* `revokeChallenge`
* `prepareForAuthentication`

All of these methods interact with the same `ServiceProvider` class and have similar sink code entries, which suggests that they are related to biometric authentication and require a moderate level of access control.

Additionally, the method `invalidateAuthenticatorId` is used to invalidate an authenticator ID, which is a sensitive operation that requires some level of access control. However, it does not seem to be as sensitive as operations that require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the semantics of the method, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `invalidateAuthenticatorId` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
