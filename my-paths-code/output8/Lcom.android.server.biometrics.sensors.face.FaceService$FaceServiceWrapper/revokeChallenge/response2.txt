Based on the provided information and the similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `revokeChallenge` method.

The `revokeChallenge` method is used to revoke a challenge in the fingerprint service. The similar APIs provided are also related to biometric services, such as face recognition and fingerprint authentication. They all have a similarity score above 0.85, indicating that they are quite similar to the `revokeChallenge` method.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `NORMAL`, which suggests that they do not require a high level of protection. The `revokeChallenge` method also does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it is used to revoke a challenge, which is a relatively benign operation.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the semantics of the `revokeChallenge` method, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to this method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
