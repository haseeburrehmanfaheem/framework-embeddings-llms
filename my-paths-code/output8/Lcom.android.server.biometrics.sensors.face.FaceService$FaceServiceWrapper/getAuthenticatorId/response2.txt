Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getAuthenticatorId` method.

The `getAuthenticatorId` method is a getter method that retrieves the authenticator ID for a given sensor. The method does not modify any data and only returns a value. 

All the similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NORMAL`. These APIs interact with the same sinks (e.g., `ServiceProvider`) and have similar semantics to the `getAuthenticatorId` method.

Given that the `getAuthenticatorId` method is a getter method and does not pose a significant security risk, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to this method. This is because reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and the method does not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

However, considering that all similar APIs have a `NORMAL` access control level and this API doesn't seem to pose any significant security risk but still handles sensitive biometric data, I would rather choose `NORMAL` over `NONE`.

So the final answer is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
