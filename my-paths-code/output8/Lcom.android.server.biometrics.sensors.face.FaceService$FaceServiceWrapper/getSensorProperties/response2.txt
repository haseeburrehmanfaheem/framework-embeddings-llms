To determine the access control level for the `getSensorProperties` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets for `getSensorProperties` show that it interacts with a `ServiceProvider` to retrieve sensor properties. The method takes two parameters, an integer `p1` and a string `p2`, but only `p1` is used in the interaction with the `ServiceProvider`. This suggests that the method's primary function is related to retrieving properties of a specific sensor identified by `p1`.

The similar APIs provided, `getAuthenticatorId(II)J` and `getSensorProperties(ILjava/lang/String;)Landroid/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintSensorPropertiesInternal;`, both have an access control level of `NORMAL`. These methods also interact with a `ServiceProvider` to retrieve specific information (authenticator ID in one case and sensor properties in the other). The similarity in how these methods operate, especially considering their interaction with `ServiceProvider` instances and their purpose of retrieving specific types of data, suggests that they share similar security requirements.

Given this analysis:

- The method does not seem to perform any operations that would be considered dangerous or require system or signature-level permissions based on the provided information.
- It follows a pattern similar to other methods classified as `NORMAL`, which involves interacting with service providers to retrieve specific data without indications of high-risk operations.
- There's no clear indication that this method should have lesser protection (`NONE`) since it does interact with potentially sensitive sensor data, albeit in a read-only manner.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons with similar APIs, the access control level for `getSensorProperties` should be classified as `NORMAL`.
