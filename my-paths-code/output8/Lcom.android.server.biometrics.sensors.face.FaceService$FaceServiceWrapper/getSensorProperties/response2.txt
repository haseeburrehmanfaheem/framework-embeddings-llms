Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getSensorProperties` method.

The `getSensorProperties` method is a getter method that returns sensor properties. In Android, getter methods typically require less restrictive access control compared to setter methods, as reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NORMAL`, which suggests that they are not highly sensitive and do not require strict access control. The similarities between the APIs and the `getSensorProperties` method, such as the use of `ServiceProvider` and sensor-related operations, also support assigning a similar access control level.

Considering these factors, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getSensorProperties` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities with other APIs and the relatively low sensitivity of getter methods. However, if additional information or context suggests that this method requires more restrictive access control, the assigned level may need to be revised.
