Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `remove` method in the `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` class.

The `remove` method has a high similarity with other methods that have an access control level of `NORMAL`, such as `remove(Landroid/os/IBinder;IILandroid/hardware/fingerprint/IFingerprintServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;)V` in the `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` class and `setFeature(Landroid/os/IBinder;IIZ[BLandroid/hardware/face/IFaceServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;)V` in the same class.

Additionally, other methods with similar functionality, such as `cancelEnrollment(Landroid/os/IBinder;J)V` and `enroll(ILandroid/os/IBinder;[BLandroid/hardware/face/IFaceServiceReceiver;Ljava/lang/String;[ILandroid/view/Surface;Z)J`, also have an access control level of `NORMAL`.

The only method with a different access control level is `cancelFaceDetect(Landroid/os/IBinder;Ljava/lang/String;J)V`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, this method has a lower similarity score compared to the other methods.

Considering the similarities and access control levels of the provided APIs, I conclude that the `remove` method in the `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` class should have an access control level of `NORMAL`.
