Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `enroll` method in the `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` class.

The `enroll` method has a high similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `NORMAL`. For example, the `enroll` method in the `FingerprintService$FingerprintServiceWrapper` class has a similarity of 0.9942662119865417 and an access control level of `NORMAL`. Similarly, the `setFeature` method in the `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` class has a similarity of 0.8522212505340576 and an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Additionally, other APIs with similar functionality, such as `cancelEnrollment` and `remove`, also have an access control level of `NORMAL`. The only API with a different access control level is `authenticate`, which has a level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, this method has a different purpose and functionality compared to the `enroll` method.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and their access control levels, I assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `enroll` method in the `FaceService$FaceServiceWrapper` class.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
