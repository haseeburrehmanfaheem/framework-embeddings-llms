To determine the access control level for the `getRootTaskInfo` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sinks, and similar APIs.

The provided code paths show that the method interacts with sensitive system components, such as `RootWindowContainer`, `Task`, and `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo`. The sinks indicate that the method returns sensitive information about tasks and their associated activities.

The similar APIs, `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay(III)Landroid/app/ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo;`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive task information.

Considering the similarities between the code paths, sinks, and similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getRootTaskInfo` method also requires system or signature-level permission to access sensitive task information.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getRootTaskInfo` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method can only be accessed by system-level components or components with a signature-level permission, ensuring that sensitive task information is protected from unauthorized access.
