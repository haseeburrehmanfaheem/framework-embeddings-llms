To determine the access control level for the `keyguardGoingAway` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets show three different paths (depths) of execution within the `keyguardGoingAway` method. All these paths involve interactions with system-level components, such as clearing calling identity via `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`, boosting thread priority, and iterating over displays in `mRootWindowContainer`. These operations suggest that the method is performing actions that require a certain level of privilege or access control.

The sink code provided highlights specific parts of the method's execution related to security and system-level operations:
1. Clearing calling identity (`Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`) and then iterating over displays with a lambda expression.
2. Enforcing not isolated caller check (`ActivityTaskManagerService.enforceNotIsolatedCaller("keyguardGoingAway")`), followed by similar operations.

Given the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided APIs:
- `setLockScreenShown(ZZ)V` has a high similarity score (above 0.87) with the `keyguardGoingAway` method and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that both methods are dealing with system-level functionality related to lock screen states, which requires either system or signature-level permissions.

Considering these points:
- The operations within `keyguardGoingAway` involve system-level calls and checks (e.g., clearing calling identity, checking isolated callers).
- The high similarity scores with `setLockScreenShown(ZZ)V`, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
- The nature of the method's interactions with system components.

It is reasonable to conclude that the `keyguardGoingAway` method should have an access control level that reflects its need for system-level permissions or signature-level access due to its involvement in managing keyguard states and interacting with sensitive system operations.

Therefore, based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is made considering the method's functionality, its interactions with system components, and the access control levels of highly similar APIs.
