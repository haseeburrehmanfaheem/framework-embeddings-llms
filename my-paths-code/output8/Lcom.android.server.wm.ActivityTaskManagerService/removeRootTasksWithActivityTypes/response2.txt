To determine the access control level for the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets show three different paths (depths) of execution for the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method. Each path interacts with system components such as `WindowContainer`, `DisplayContent`, and `RootWindowContainer`, which are involved in managing windowing tasks and activities on Android devices.

1. **Path 1 (Depth 2)**: This path iterates through children of a `WindowContainer`, checks for certain conditions, and if met, removes root tasks using `RootWindowContainer.mTaskSupervisor.removeRootTask(v18)`. It also involves clearing and restoring the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5)`, which is a common pattern in Android system services to manage security and permissions.

2. **Path 2 (Depth 1)**: This path gets the child count of `RootWindowContainer`, retrieves the last child, and calls `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` on that child with the provided parameter `p1`. It also involves boosting thread priority using `this.sThreadPriorityBooster.boost()` and resetting it later.

3. **Path 3 (Depth 0)**: This is the simplest path where it directly calls `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` on `mRootWindowContainer` with the provided parameter `p1`, after boosting the priority for a locked section.

The sink code snippets show interactions with system-level components and operations that could potentially impact system security or stability, such as removing root tasks and managing windowing modes.

Given similar APIs (`removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates these methods require either system or signature permissions to execute due to their potential impact on the system's security and stability. The similarity in code patterns, such as removing root tasks and interacting with windowing modes, suggests that `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` also deals with sensitive operations that could affect the system.

Therefore, considering the interactions with system components, the operations performed (e.g., removing root tasks), and the similarities with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is reasonable to conclude that `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
