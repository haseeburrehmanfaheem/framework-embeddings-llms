To determine the access control level for the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method in the `Lcom.android.server.wm.ActivityTaskManagerService` class, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided API has a high similarity (above 0.95) with `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method may require a similar level of access control, as it interacts with similar sinks and has comparable functionality.

Additionally, other APIs like `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay`, `setFocusedRootTask`, `setFocusedTask`, and `getAllRootTaskInfos` have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although their similarity scores are lower (ranging from 0.80 to 0.84), they still indicate that methods interacting with root tasks and windowing modes often require system or signature-level permissions.

Given the similarities and the sensitive nature of removing root tasks, which can impact the system's overall state and security, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method should have a similar access control level to ensure that only authorized components can perform such operations.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, the final access control level for the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the need to restrict access to this method to system or signature-level components, ensuring that only authorized entities can remove root tasks with specific activity types.
