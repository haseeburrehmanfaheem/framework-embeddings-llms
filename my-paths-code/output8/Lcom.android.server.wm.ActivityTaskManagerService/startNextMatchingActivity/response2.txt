To determine the access control level for the `startNextMatchingActivity` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their corresponding access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `startActivityAsCaller` with a similarity of 0.8356178402900696 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
2. `startActivityAsUser` with a similarity of 0.8081083297729492 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
3. `requestNotificationAccess` with a similarity of 0.7969812750816345 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
4. `setFocusedRootTask` with a similarity of 0.7816042900085449 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
5. `getFrontActivityScreenCompatMode` with a similarity of 0.777513325214386 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. The similarities between these APIs and `startNextMatchingActivity` are relatively high, suggesting that they share common functionality and security requirements.

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that `startNextMatchingActivity` should also have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to maintain consistency with similar APIs and ensure the security of the system.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities between `startNextMatchingActivity` and other APIs, as well as the security requirements implied by their access control levels.
