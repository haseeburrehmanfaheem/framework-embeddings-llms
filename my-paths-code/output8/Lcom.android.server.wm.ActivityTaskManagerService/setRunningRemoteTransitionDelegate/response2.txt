Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I will determine the appropriate access control level for the `setRunningRemoteTransitionDelegate` method.

The method is used to set a delegate for running remote transitions, which involves interacting with the system's window manager and process controllers. The similar APIs provided all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

The `setRunningRemoteTransitionDelegate` method also interacts with system-level components, such as the window manager and process controllers, which suggests that it should have a similar access control level. Additionally, the method's functionality is related to managing remote transitions, which could potentially impact the system's performance and security.

Considering these factors, I conclude that the `setRunningRemoteTransitionDelegate` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, similar to the provided similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
