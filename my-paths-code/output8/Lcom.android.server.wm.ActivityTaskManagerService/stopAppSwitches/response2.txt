To determine the access control level for the `stopAppSwitches` method, let's analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar API, `resumeAppSwitches`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The `stopAppSwitches` method modifies the state of app switches (`this.mAppSwitchesState = 0;`), records the current time in milliseconds since the system was booted (`SystemClock.uptimeMillis()`), and removes or delays messages related to app switching.
   - This method seems to be involved in managing the state of app switching, potentially for performance, security, or user experience reasons.

2. **Comparison with Similar API**:
   - The `resumeAppSwitches` method, with a similarity score of 0.8034913539886475, suggests that it shares significant functionality or operational context with `stopAppSwitches`. It sets the app switch state to 2 and removes messages related to app switching.
   - Given its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, this implies that `resumeAppSwitches` requires either system or signature-level permission to execute, indicating it performs sensitive operations.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - The operations performed by `stopAppSwitches`, such as modifying app switch states and interacting with the handler (`this.mH`) to remove or delay messages, could be considered sensitive in terms of system performance and security.
   - However, without direct interactions with external storage, network, or other typically dangerous operations (like those involving user privacy data), it might not necessarily require `DANGEROUS` permissions.
   - The method does not seem to perform actions that would categorize it as `NONE`, given its impact on system state.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the similarity with `resumeAppSwitches` and the nature of operations (modifying system states related to app switching), it's reasonable to infer that `stopAppSwitches` should have a similar access control level.
   - The lack of explicit dangerous operations (e.g., accessing sensitive user data, making network calls) but its involvement in system state management suggests it doesn't fit neatly into the `DANGEROUS` category based on provided information.

Given these considerations and without explicit evidence of `stopAppSwitches` requiring `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `NONE` access control levels based on standard Android permission categories, and considering its operational similarity to `resumeAppSwitches`, it seems most appropriate to align its access control level with that of the similar API.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `stopAppSwitches` method is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
