Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `registerRemoteAnimationsForDisplay` method.

The method `registerRemoteAnimationsForDisplay` is used to register remote animations for a display. It involves getting the calling PID and UID using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`, and then setting the calling PID and UID on the `RemoteAnimationDefinition` object. This suggests that the method is related to managing and controlling display animations, which could potentially be sensitive.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs are also related to managing and controlling various aspects of the system, such as TV interactive app sessions, tasks, and signal strength.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `registerRemoteAnimationsForDisplay` method, I believe that it should have a similar access control level. Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `registerRemoteAnimationsForDisplay` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
