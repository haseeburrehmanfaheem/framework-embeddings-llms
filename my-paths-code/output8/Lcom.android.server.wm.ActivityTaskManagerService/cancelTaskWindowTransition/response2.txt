Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, we can determine that the `cancelTaskWindowTransition` method should have a similar access control level to the other methods that interact with task-related operations.

The similar APIs provided, such as `getTaskBounds`, `takeTaskSnapshot`, `removeTask`, `getTaskDescription`, and `startSystemLockTaskMode`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are considered sensitive and require a higher level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications or access to task-related data.

The `cancelTaskWindowTransition` method, which cancels the window transition for a specific task, also interacts with task-related operations and has similar sink code entries as the other APIs. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should have a similar access control level to prevent unauthorized modifications or access to task-related data.

Given the similarities in the code and the access control levels of the provided APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `cancelTaskWindowTransition` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
