Based on the provided information, I will analyze the API and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` method appears to be related to managing root tasks in the Android system, specifically removing them based on certain windowing modes. The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them seem to interact with the `RootWindowContainer` and its child components.

Looking at the similar APIs provided, we can see that they are all related to managing root tasks, displays, or activities in the Android system. The access control levels for these similar APIs are mostly `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a high level of privilege to execute.

The most similar API, `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and shares a similarity score of 0.9804109930992126 with the target API. This suggests that the two APIs are closely related in terms of functionality and likely require similar access control levels.

Considering the above analysis, I conclude that the `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is closely related to other system-internal APIs that manage root tasks and displays.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
