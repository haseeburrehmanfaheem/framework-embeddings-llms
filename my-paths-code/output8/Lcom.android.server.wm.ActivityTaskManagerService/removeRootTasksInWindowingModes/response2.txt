To determine the access control level for the `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, interacting with window management and task supervision components. It involves removing root tasks based on certain conditions and parameters passed to it.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate interactions with `WindowContainer`, `RootWindowContainer`, and task supervision, which are critical for managing windows and tasks in the Android system.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes([I)V**: This API has a high similarity score (0.980411171913147 and 0.9576455950737) with `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to execute, as they directly manipulate tasks and windows which are sensitive operations.

Given the high similarity in functionality and code structure between `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` and the provided similar APIs (`removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes`), and considering the critical nature of the operations (removing root tasks which affects window management and potentially system stability or security), it's reasonable to conclude that `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` should also have a restrictive access control level.

Therefore, based on the similarity in code and functionality with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, and considering the sensitive nature of removing root tasks in windowing modes which could impact system stability or security, the appropriate access control level for `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
