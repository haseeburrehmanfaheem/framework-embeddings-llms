To determine the access control level for the `startActivityAndWait` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `startActivityAsUser` in `Lcom.android.server.pm.CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl` with a similarity of 0.8543422222137451 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `startActivityAsCaller` in `Lcom.android.server.wm.ActivityTaskManagerService` with similarities of 0.850834846496582 and 0.8102619051933289, and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. `startActivityAsUserByIntent` in `Lcom.android.server.pm.CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl` with a similarity of 0.8504974842071533 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
4. `startActivityAsUser` in `Lcom.android.server.wm.ActivityTaskManagerService` with a similarity of 0.8374229073524475 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
5. `startActivityWithConfig` in `Lcom.android.server.wm.ActivityTaskManagerService` with a similarity of 0.8277695178985596 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the high similarities between these APIs and the `startActivityAndWait` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `startActivityAndWait` method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `startActivityAndWait` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only authorized system or signature-level components can call this method, preventing potential security risks.
