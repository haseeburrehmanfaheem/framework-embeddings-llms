To determine the access control level for the `startVoiceActivity` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show that `startVoiceActivity` interacts with various system components, such as `ActivityStarter`, `ActivityStartController`, and `mAmInternal`. It also handles user IDs, intents, and permissions.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `startAssistantActivity`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8944963216781616 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows that it also interacts with `mAmInternal` and `ActivityStarter`, similar to `startVoiceActivity`.
2. `startActivities`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8745002746582031 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows that it interacts with `mAmInternal` and `ActivityStartController`, also similar to `startVoiceActivity`.

Given the similarities in code and functionality, it is reasonable to conclude that `startVoiceActivity` should have a similar access control level.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" \}}$
