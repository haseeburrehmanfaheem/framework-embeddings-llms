Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `getFocusedRootTaskInfo` method.

The method interacts with sensitive data, such as task information and display content, which suggests that it requires a certain level of access control. The similar APIs provided, `getRootTaskInfo` and `setFocusedTask`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions.

The code snippets for the `getFocusedRootTaskInfo` method show that it accesses task information, display content, and performs operations on these objects. This is similar to the operations performed by the `getRootTaskInfo` and `setFocusedTask` APIs, which also access and manipulate sensitive data.

Given the similarities between the `getFocusedRootTaskInfo` method and the provided similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getFocusedRootTaskInfo` method requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getFocusedRootTaskInfo` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This indicates that the `getFocusedRootTaskInfo` method requires system or signature-level permissions to access and manipulate sensitive data.
