Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `setSplitScreenResizing` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setSplitScreenResizing` method modifies the state of the docked root task resizing, which is a sensitive operation that affects the window manager's behavior. The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately modify the `mDockedRootTaskResizing` field or call other methods that perform similar operations.

The similar APIs provided, `setTaskResizeable` and `moveRootTaskToDisplay`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the window manager and modify sensitive state, which suggests that they require a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `setSplitScreenResizing` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `setSplitScreenResizing` method should have a similar access control level. Since the method modifies sensitive state and interacts with the window manager, it requires a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the recommended access control level for the `setSplitScreenResizing` method is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
