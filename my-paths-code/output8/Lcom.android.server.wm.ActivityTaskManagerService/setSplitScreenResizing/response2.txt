To determine the access control level for the `setSplitScreenResizing` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the sinks it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `setSplitScreenResizing` method is used to set whether split-screen resizing is enabled or disabled. This functionality seems related to system-level operations, as it involves managing task resizing and docked divider controller settings, which are typically restricted to system or signature applications due to their potential impact on the system's UI and behavior.

Looking at the provided paths for the API:

1. **Path 1 (Depth 2)**: This path modifies `mDockedRootTaskResizing` and interacts with `DockedTaskDividerController` to set resizing, followed by a request for traversal. It directly affects the docked divider's behavior.
2. **Path 2 (Depth 1)**: Similar to Path 1, it changes `mDockedRootTaskResizing` but also involves setting docked root task resizing through `WindowManager`. This suggests interaction with window management at a system level.
3. **Path 3 (Depth 0)**: This path simply delegates the setting of split-screen resizing to `TaskSupervisor`, indicating a higher-level abstraction in managing tasks.

The sink code provided shows direct modifications to task resizing properties and interactions with window management components, which are sensitive operations typically requiring elevated permissions.

Given these observations and comparing them with the similar APIs:

- **setTaskResizeable(II)V**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it's restricted to system or signature applications. Its functionality involves setting resize modes for tasks, which is somewhat analogous to the resizing operations in `setSplitScreenResizing`.

Considering the similarities in functionality and the potential system impact, it's reasonable to conclude that `setSplitScreenResizing` should have a similar access control level to prevent unauthorized modifications to system-level task management behaviors.

Therefore, based on the analysis of its behavior, interactions with sensitive system components, and comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `setSplitScreenResizing` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the need to restrict this functionality to system or signature applications to maintain system integrity and prevent potential misuse.
