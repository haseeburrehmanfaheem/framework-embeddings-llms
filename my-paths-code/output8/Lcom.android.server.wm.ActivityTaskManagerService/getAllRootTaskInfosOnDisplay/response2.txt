To determine the access control level for the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately interact with `RootWindowContainer` or its subclasses to retrieve task information. This interaction involves iterating over tasks and potentially accessing sensitive system information.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets indicate that the method returns an `ArrayList` containing task information, which could be considered sensitive as it might reveal details about running applications or system processes.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getAllRootTaskInfos()Ljava/util/List;**: This API has a high similarity score and is assigned the access control level `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows that it retrieves all root task information without any specific filtering, which suggests it requires system or signature-level permission due to its potential to expose sensitive system data.
   - **removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes([I)V**: Although this API has a lower similarity score compared to `getAllRootTaskInfos()`, it still operates on tasks and is assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Its functionality involves removing tasks based on certain criteria, which implies modification of system state and thus requires elevated permissions.

Given these points:

- The method `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` deals with retrieving task information, which can be considered sensitive.
- Similar APIs that interact with task information are assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their potential impact on system security and privacy.
- The method's functionality does not seem to pose an immediate danger like deleting data or making significant changes to system settings but does involve accessing potentially sensitive information about running tasks.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of the information it handles and the precedent set by similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the need to protect system integrity and user privacy.
