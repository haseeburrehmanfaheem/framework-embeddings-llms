Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method.

The method is similar to other APIs in the same class (`Lcom.android.server.wm.ActivityTaskManagerService`) that have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs include:

* `getAllRootTaskInfos()Ljava/util/List;`
* `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes([I)V`
* `setFocusedRootTask(I)V`
* `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes([I)V`
* `getTaskBounds(I)Landroid/graphics/Rect;`

All of these APIs have a high similarity score with the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method, and they all interact with the same sinks (e.g., `RootWindowContainer`, `DisplayContent`, `Task`). Additionally, they all seem to be related to task management and windowing modes, which suggests that they require a similar level of access control.

Given this information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method, as it is likely to require a similar level of protection as the other APIs in the same class.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity between the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method and other APIs in the same class, as well as the potential security risks associated with task management and windowing modes.
