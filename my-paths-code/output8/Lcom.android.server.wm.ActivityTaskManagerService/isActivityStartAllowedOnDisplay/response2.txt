To determine the access control level for the `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - The method has three different code paths (depths), but all of them involve checking if an activity can be started on a specific display. This includes resolving intents, checking caller permissions, and verifying display compatibility.
   - The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` suggests that the method is concerned with identifying and validating the caller's identity, which is a common practice in access control.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`startAssistantActivity` and `startActivities`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that they are system-level or signature-protected methods, suggesting they require elevated permissions to execute.
   - These APIs also deal with activity management and launching, which involves security-sensitive operations. The presence of `handleIncomingUser`, setting calling UIDs, packages, and features, followed by the execution of activities, implies a need for strict access control.

3. **Comparison and Decision**:
   - Given that `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` is involved in determining whether an activity can be launched on a specific display, it interacts with system-level components (like `ActivityTaskSupervisor`) and performs checks that are indicative of security-sensitive operations.
   - The method's focus on validating the conditions under which an activity can start suggests it plays a role in enforcing access control policies related to activity launching, similar to the provided APIs.

Based on this analysis, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` seems appropriate. This is because the method's functionality and interactions with system components imply a need for protection against unauthorized access or misuse, aligning with the access control levels of the similar APIs provided.
