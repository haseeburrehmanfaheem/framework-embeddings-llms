Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method is used to check if an activity can be started on a specific display. It involves resolving the activity's intent, checking the caller's permissions, and verifying if the activity can be placed on the specified display.

The similar APIs provided have the following characteristics:

* `startAssistantActivity`, `startActivities`, and `startVoiceActivity` all have a similarity score above 0.72 and are related to starting activities or voice interactions. They all require the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they need system or signature-level permissions to execute.
* `setGameMode` has a similarity score of 0.722858726978302 and is related to setting the game mode for a package. It also requires the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
* `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList` has a similarity score of 0.7172621488571167 and is related to retrieving a list of TV interactive app services. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require any specific permissions.

Considering the similarities between the APIs, I notice that all the methods related to starting activities or interacting with the activity manager (e.g., `startAssistantActivity`, `startActivities`, `startVoiceActivity`) require the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This suggests that these methods are sensitive and require system-level permissions to execute.

On the other hand, the `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList` method has a lower similarity score and does not require any specific permissions (access control level `NONE`). However, this method is not directly related to activity management or starting activities.

Given the context of the `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method, which involves checking if an activity can be started on a specific display, I believe it is more closely related to the methods that require system-level permissions (e.g., `startAssistantActivity`, `startActivities`, `startVoiceActivity`). Therefore, I conclude that the `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
