To determine the access control level for the `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method in the `ActivityTaskManagerService` class, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with similar APIs.

The `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method is designed to remove all visible recent tasks. This operation involves modifying system-level data related to task management, which can have security implications. Given this context, let's evaluate the provided information:

1. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The `getRecentTasks(III)Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that accessing recent tasks requires system or signature-level permission, indicating a need for protection against unauthorized access.
   - The `getAppTasks(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/List;` method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, reinforcing the notion that task-related operations are sensitive and require elevated permissions.
   - In contrast, the `addAppTask(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/content/Intent;Landroid/app/ActivityManager$TaskDescription;Landroid/graphics/Bitmap;)I` method has an access control level of `NONE`. However, adding a task might be considered less sensitive than removing all visible tasks, as it doesn't necessarily impact the security or integrity of the system in the same way.

2. **Method Functionality**:
   - The `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method modifies system state by removing tasks, which could potentially be used to hide malicious activity or disrupt user experience.
   - This operation seems more aligned with methods that require higher access control levels due to its potential impact on system security and user data.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - In Android, if a setter method (which modifies state) requires access control, the related getter method (which only reads state) does not necessarily need the same level of restriction.
   - Given that `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` is essentially a "setter" method (it changes system state), it likely requires a higher level of access control compared to methods that merely retrieve information.

Considering these points, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` seems appropriate. This is because the operation involves modifying sensitive system data related to task management, which should be protected against unauthorized access to maintain system security and integrity.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the principles of securing system-modifying operations and is consistent with the access control levels assigned to similar task management APIs.
