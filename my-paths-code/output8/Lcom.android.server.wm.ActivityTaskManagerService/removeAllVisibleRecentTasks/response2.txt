To determine the access control level for the `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) that essentially perform the same operation - removing all visible recent tasks. These paths involve getting recent tasks, checking user IDs, and removing tasks based on certain conditions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided are directly related to the operations within `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks`, involving getting recent tasks, removing tasks, and notifying changes.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are mentioned: `getRecentTasks(III)Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;`. Both have a high similarity score with `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` and are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that the API can be accessed by system or signature applications, suggesting it deals with sensitive operations or data that require elevated permissions.

Given this information:

- **Similarity in Functionality**: The similar APIs (`getRecentTasks`) are related to managing recent tasks and have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This suggests that operations on recent tasks, whether reading or modifying them, are considered sensitive.
  
- **Nature of the Operation**: `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` modifies system-level data (recent tasks) which could potentially impact user experience, privacy, or security if misused.

- **Access Control Levels**:
  - `NONE`: No restrictions, which seems inappropriate given the potential sensitivity of task management.
  - `NORMAL`: Available to all apps without special permissions, which might be too permissive for an operation that affects system-level data.
  - `DANGEROUS`: Requires explicit user permission, which could be applicable but seems less relevant since this operation is more about system management than direct user data access.
  - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Restricted to system or apps signed with the platform key, indicating a high level of trust and control over system resources.

Considering these points, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` seems most appropriate. This is because the operation involves modifying system-level data (recent tasks) that could impact user privacy or security if not properly controlled. The similarity with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level further supports this decision.
