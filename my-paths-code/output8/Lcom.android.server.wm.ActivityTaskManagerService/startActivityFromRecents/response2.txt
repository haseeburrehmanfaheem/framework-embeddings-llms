To determine the access control level for the `startActivityFromRecents` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The code snippets show that `startActivityFromRecents` involves interactions with various system components, such as `Binder`, `ActivityTaskSupervisor`, and `WindowManagerService`. It also deals with sensitive operations like starting activities, managing tasks, and handling user IDs.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - The first similar API, `startActivity`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method is involved in starting new activities, which can impact system security and privacy.
   - The second similar API, `notifySignalStrength`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although it seems unrelated at first glance because it deals with signal strength notifications, its access control level indicates that it interacts with system-level components or sensitive information.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose a security risk.
   - `NORMAL`: Used for methods that require some level of access control but are generally considered safe when used appropriately.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Applies to methods that can potentially cause harm or violate privacy if misused.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-level operations or those requiring signature-level permissions, indicating a high level of sensitivity and potential impact on system security or user data.

Given the information:
- The method interacts with system components and handles sensitive operations like starting activities and managing tasks.
- Similar APIs have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, suggesting that these operations are considered system-level or require signature permissions due to their potential impact on system security and privacy.

**Conclusion**: Considering the sensitivity of the operations performed by `startActivityFromRecents`, its interaction with system components, and the access control levels of similar APIs, it is reasonable to assign a high level of access control to this method.

The final answer is: $\boxed{{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }}$
