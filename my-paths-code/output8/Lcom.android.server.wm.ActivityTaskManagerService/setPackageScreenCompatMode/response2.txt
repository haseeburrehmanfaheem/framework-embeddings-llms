Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `setPackageScreenCompatMode` method.

The method is used to set the screen compatibility mode for a package, which involves modifying the package's compatibility flags. This operation requires careful consideration of security risks, as it can potentially affect the behavior of multiple applications.

Similar APIs, such as `setFrontActivityScreenCompatMode`, `getPackageScreenCompatMode`, `setPackageAskScreenCompat`, and `getPackageAskScreenCompat`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also related to package compatibility modes and require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

The `getGameModeInfo` method, although not directly related to screen compatibility modes, also deals with application information and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the potential security risks associated with modifying package compatibility flags, I conclude that the `setPackageScreenCompatMode` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This ensures that only system or signature-level privileged components can modify package screen compatibility modes, reducing the risk of unauthorized or malicious changes.
