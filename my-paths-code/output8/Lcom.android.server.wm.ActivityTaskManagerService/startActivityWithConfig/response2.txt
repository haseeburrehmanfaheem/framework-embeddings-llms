Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `startActivityWithConfig` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `startActivityWithConfig` method is used to start an activity with a specific configuration. It takes several parameters, including the intent, calling package, resolved type, result to, result who, request code, start flags, global configuration, and user ID.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are also related to starting activities, and they share similar parameters and functionality with the `startActivityWithConfig` method.

After reviewing the code snippets and sink code entries for the similar APIs, I notice that they all involve obtaining an `ActivityStarter` instance, setting various properties (e.g., intent, caller, calling package, resolved type), and executing the activity start request. The `startActivityWithConfig` method follows a similar pattern.

Given the similarities between the `startActivityWithConfig` method and the other APIs, I conclude that it should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because starting an activity with a specific configuration can potentially impact system behavior and security, and therefore requires system or signature-level permission to access.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only authorized system components or applications with the required signature can start activities using the `startActivityWithConfig` method, thereby maintaining system security and stability.
