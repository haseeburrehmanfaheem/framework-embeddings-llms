Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `startActivityWithConfig` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `startActivityWithConfig` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve starting an activity with various parameters. The method uses `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the caller's process ID and user ID, which suggests that it is related to inter-process communication and user authentication.

The similar APIs provided are `startActivityAsCaller` and `startActivity`, both of which have a similarity score above 0.8. These APIs also involve starting activities, and their access control levels are both `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all involve starting activities, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper authentication and authorization, I believe that the `startActivityWithConfig` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the `startActivityWithConfig` method requires a system or signature-level permission to be called, which is consistent with the sensitive nature of starting activities.
