Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method.

The `getAllRootTaskInfos` method is used to retrieve a list of all root task infos. This method does not modify any data but only reads it. The similar APIs provided have varying levels of access control, but most of them are restricted to `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions.

The API `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` has a similarity score of 0.9798653721809387 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API is also used to retrieve root task infos, but it is restricted to a specific display. Given the high similarity score, it can be inferred that the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method should have a similar access control level.

Another API, `finishVoiceTask`, has a relatively low similarity score of 0.939338207244873 and an access control level of `NONE`. However, this API is used to finish a voice task, which is a different operation than retrieving root task infos.

The other APIs provided, such as `setLockScreenShown`, `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes`, and `setTaskResizeable`, all have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are used to modify data or perform actions that require system-level permissions.

Considering the similarities and differences between these APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method. This is because the method retrieves sensitive information about root tasks, which may require system-level permissions to access.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method is protected with an appropriate access control level, considering its similarities with other APIs and the potential sensitivity of the data it retrieves.
