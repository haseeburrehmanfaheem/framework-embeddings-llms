To determine the access control level for the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths with varying depths, all of which involve interacting with `RootWindowContainer` and its methods to retrieve or manipulate task information. The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)` suggests that the method is concerned with managing caller identity, potentially for security or permission reasons.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show how the method returns lists of tasks (`ArrayList`) after performing operations on them, indicating that it provides access to task information.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay(I)Ljava/util/List;` has a high similarity score and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that accessing root task information is typically restricted to system or signature-level permissions, possibly due to the sensitive nature of the data.
   - `finishVoiceTask(Landroid/service/voice/IVoiceInteractionSession;)V` has a lower similarity score and an access control level of `NONE`, but it involves a different operation (finishing a voice task) and does not directly relate to accessing task information.

Given these points, the method `getAllRootTaskInfos` seems to be involved in retrieving sensitive information about tasks, which is typically restricted. The high similarity with `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay(I)Ljava/util/List;`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggests that `getAllRootTaskInfos` should also have a similar or equally restrictive access control level due to the nature of the data it handles.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality and its similarity with other restricted APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getAllRootTaskInfos` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
