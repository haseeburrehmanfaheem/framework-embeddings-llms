Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getKey` method.

The `getKey` method is used to retrieve a key from the recoverable key store. The similar APIs provided are all related to generating, importing, or removing keys, which suggests that they are all part of the same security-sensitive functionality.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. This is likely because these methods are modifying or accessing sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys.

Given the similarities between the `getKey` method and the other APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getKey` method should also have a similar access control level. However, since the `getKey` method is only retrieving a key and not modifying any data, it may not require the same level of restriction as the other methods.

Considering this, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getKey` method, but with the understanding that the getter method may have a lower access control level than the corresponding setter methods.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

However, after reevaluating the information provided and considering the principle that if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level, I realized that the `getKey` method should have the same access control level as the similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
