Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `removeKey` method.

The `removeKey` method interacts with sensitive data, such as keys stored in the key store database, and performs deletion operations. This suggests that it requires a certain level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `closeSession`, `getKey`, `getRecoveryStatus`, `setRecoveryStatus`, and `generateKey` all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with sensitive data or perform critical operations, which justifies their high access control level.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `removeKey` method, it is reasonable to conclude that `removeKey` should have a similar access control level. The fact that `removeKey` modifies sensitive data (by deleting keys) further supports this conclusion.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeKey` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the analysis of similar APIs and the sensitive nature of the data being modified by the `removeKey` method.
