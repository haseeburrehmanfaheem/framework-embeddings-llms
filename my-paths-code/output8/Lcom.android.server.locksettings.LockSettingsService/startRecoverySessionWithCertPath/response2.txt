Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level to the `startRecoverySessionWithCertPath` method.

The method is part of the `LockSettingsService` class, which handles sensitive operations related to lock settings and recovery. The method itself involves certificate validation, public key encryption, and storage of recovery session data.

Similar APIs with high similarity scores (e.g., `initRecoveryServiceWithSigFile`, `isAppSourceCertificateTrusted`, `setRecoveryStatus`, `getKey`, and `importKey`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also deal with sensitive operations, such as certificate validation, key management, and recovery service initialization.

Given the sensitive nature of the `startRecoverySessionWithCertPath` method and its similarities to other methods with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, I would assign a similar access control level to this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the method's involvement in sensitive operations and its need for restricted access to prevent potential security risks.
