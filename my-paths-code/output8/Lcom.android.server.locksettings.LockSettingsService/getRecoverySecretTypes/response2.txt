Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getRecoverySecretTypes` method.

The `getRecoverySecretTypes` method is a getter method that retrieves recovery secret types from the database. The similar APIs provided, such as `setRecoverySecretTypes`, `setRecoveryStatus`, `getRecoveryStatus`, `getKey`, and `generateKey`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are sensitive and require a high level of access control.

However, as mentioned in the problem statement, if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level. Since the `setRecoverySecretTypes` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is likely that the `getRecoverySecretTypes` method should have a similar or lower access control level.

Given that the `getRecoverySecretTypes` method is a getter method and does not modify any sensitive data, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to this method. This is because reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and a `NORMAL` access control level provides a reasonable balance between security and usability.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

Note that this decision is based on the analysis of similar APIs and the semantics of the `getRecoverySecretTypes` method. If additional information or context were provided, the access control level may need to be revised accordingly.
