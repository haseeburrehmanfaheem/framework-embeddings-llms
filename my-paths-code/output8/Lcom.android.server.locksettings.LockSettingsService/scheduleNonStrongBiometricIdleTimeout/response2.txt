Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` method.

The `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` method has two paths:

1. Path 1: This path sends a message to the handler with a specific code (9) and argument (`p1`). The similarity of this API with other APIs is high, especially with `registerStrongAuthTracker`, `reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock`, `userPresent`, `shutdown`, and `requireStrongAuth`. All these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. Path 2: This path calls another method (`scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout`) on the `mStrongAuth` object, passing the same argument (`p1`). Although this path has a depth of 0, it is still related to the strong authentication mechanism.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because all similar APIs are related to lock settings, strong authentication, or storage shutdown, which require system or signature-level permissions.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
