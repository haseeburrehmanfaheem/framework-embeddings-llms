To determine the access control level for the `getStrongAuthForUser` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all essentially retrieve strong authentication requirements for a given user. This involves accessing internal state (`mStrongAuthRequiredForUser`, `LockSettingsService$SynchronizedStrongAuthTracker`, `mStrongAuthTracker`) to determine the strong auth flags.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show the retrieval of strong auth flags from different sources, which are then returned. This suggests that the method's primary function is to provide information about the current strong authentication settings for a user.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `registerStrongAuthTracker(Landroid/app/trust/IStrongAuthTracker;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method registers a tracker for strong auth events, implying it needs system or signature-level permission to modify the tracking behavior.
   - `requireStrongAuth(II)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that requiring strong authentication (potentially altering security settings) is a privileged operation.

Given these points:

- The `getStrongAuthForUser` method is primarily about retrieving information regarding strong authentication requirements. It does not modify system settings or user data directly but rather provides access to sensitive information about the device's security configuration.
- The similar APIs (`registerStrongAuthTracker` and `requireStrongAuth`) that interact with strong authentication mechanisms have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level because they can potentially alter the device's security state. However, `getStrongAuthForUser` is read-only in nature; it does not change any settings.
- Considering the method's purpose is to retrieve information and not to modify system settings or sensitive data directly, but still dealing with security-related information, it might not require the highest level of access control like `SYS_OR_SIG`.

However, since it deals with security settings and user authentication, which are sensitive aspects of device management, assigning it a `NONE` access control level might be too permissive. Between `NORMAL` and `DANGEROUS`, given that this method provides information rather than performing actions that could directly compromise user data or device security (like making payments or sending messages), `NORMAL` seems more appropriate.

Thus, considering the balance between the need to protect sensitive information about a device's security settings and the method's read-only nature, the access control level for `getStrongAuthForUser` should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice reflects the method's role in providing potentially sensitive information without directly endangering user data or device security through its operation.
