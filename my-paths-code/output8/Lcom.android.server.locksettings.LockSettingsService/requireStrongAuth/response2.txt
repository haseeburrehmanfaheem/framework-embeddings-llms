Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, it's clear that the `requireStrongAuth` method in the `LockSettingsService` class is interacting with sensitive functionality related to lock settings and authentication.

The similar APIs provided, such as `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem`, `registerStrongAuthTracker`, `shutdown`, `reportSuccessfulBiometricUnlock`, and `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are considered to be system-internal or signature-protected, indicating a higher level of security requirement.

Given the similarities in sink code entries, which involve obtaining and sending messages to handlers, it's reasonable to infer that the `requireStrongAuth` method is also involved in system-internal operations related to authentication and lock settings. Therefore, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method would be consistent with the security requirements observed in similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
