Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getCredentialType` method.

The `getCredentialType` method appears to be a getter method that retrieves the credential type for a given user. The method does not seem to modify any sensitive data or perform any actions that could potentially compromise the security of the system.

Upon reviewing the similar APIs provided, I notice that most of them have an access control level of `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, these methods are either setter methods or perform more complex operations that involve modifying sensitive data or interacting with external services.

In contrast, the `getCredentialType` method is a relatively simple getter method that only retrieves information. Given this, I would argue that the access control level for this method should be less restrictive than those of the similar APIs.

Considering the principles mentioned earlier, if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction. Since the `getCredentialType` method is a getter method and does not modify any sensitive data, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to this method.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment reflects the relatively low risk associated with retrieving credential type information and aligns with the principle that getter methods typically require less restrictive access control than setter methods.
