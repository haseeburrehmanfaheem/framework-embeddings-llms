Based on the provided information, we can analyze the similar APIs and their assigned access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `registerStrongAuthTracker` method.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to lock settings, storage management, and biometric authentication, which are sensitive operations that require elevated permissions.

The `registerStrongAuthTracker` method is also related to lock settings and strong authentication, which implies that it may be handling sensitive data or performing critical operations. Given the similarities with the other APIs, it is likely that this method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their assigned access control levels, I conclude that the `registerStrongAuthTracker` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
