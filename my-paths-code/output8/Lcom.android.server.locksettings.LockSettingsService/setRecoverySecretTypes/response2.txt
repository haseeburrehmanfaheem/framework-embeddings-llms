Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to the `setRecoverySecretTypes` method.

The reasoning behind this decision is as follows:

* The `getRecoverySecretTypes` method, which is a getter for the same data, has an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG". According to Android's access control principles, if a getter method requires a certain level of access control, the corresponding setter method should have an equal or higher level of restriction. Therefore, `setRecoverySecretTypes` should also have an access control level of at least "SYS_OR_SIG".
* The other similar APIs provided, such as `setRecoveryStatus`, `initRecoveryServiceWithSigFile`, `setServerParams`, and `closeSession`, all have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG". This suggests that the LockSettingsService class requires a high level of access control for methods that modify or interact with sensitive data.
* The `setRecoverySecretTypes` method modifies the recovery secret types, which is a sensitive operation that could potentially compromise the security of the device. Therefore, it is reasonable to require a high level of access control for this method.

In JSON format, the assigned access control level is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
