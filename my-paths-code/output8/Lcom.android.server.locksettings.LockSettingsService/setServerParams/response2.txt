Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, we can make an informed decision about the access control level for the `setServerParams` method.

All of the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are all related to recoverable key store management and seem to be sensitive operations that should be restricted to system-level components or apps with the appropriate signature.

The `setServerParams` method appears to be setting server parameters for the recoverable key store, which could potentially impact the security of the key store. Given its similarity to the other APIs and its potential impact on security, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method as well.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that only system-level components or apps with the appropriate signature can modify server parameters, which helps maintain the security and integrity of the recoverable key store.
