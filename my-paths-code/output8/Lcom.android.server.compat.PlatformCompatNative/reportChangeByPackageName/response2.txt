Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `reportChangeByPackageName` method.

The method interacts with sensitive data, such as application information and package names, which requires careful consideration of access control. The similar APIs provided, such as `reportChangeByUid`, `isChangeEnabledByPackageName`, `checkPhoneNumberAccess`, `getPackageScreenCompatMode`, and `setPackageScreenCompatMode`, have access control levels ranging from `SYS_OR_SIG` to `DANGEROUS`.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `reportChangeByPackageName` method is primarily concerned with reporting changes related to package names, which is a relatively internal operation. The method does not seem to expose sensitive user data or perform any critical operations that would require a high level of access control.

Given the similarities with other APIs, such as `reportChangeByUid` and `isChangeEnabledByPackageName`, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, I believe that the `reportChangeByPackageName` method should have a similar access control level. This is because these methods are all related to internal compatibility changes and do not pose a significant risk to user data or system security.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the method's functionality, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `reportChangeByPackageName` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
