Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs interact with sensitive data, such as application information and compatibility modes, and perform operations that could potentially impact the system's behavior.

The `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method also interacts with sensitive data, including application information and compatibility changes. It retrieves application information using the `getApplicationInfo` method and checks if a change is enabled for a specific package using the `willBeEnabled` method.

Considering the similarities between the provided APIs and the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also requires system or signature-level permission to access. This is because it handles sensitive data and performs operations that could potentially impact the system's behavior.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I assign the following access control level to the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only authorized components with system or signature-level permission can access this method, protecting sensitive data and preventing potential security risks.
