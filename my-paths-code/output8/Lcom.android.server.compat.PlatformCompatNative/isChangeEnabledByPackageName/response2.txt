To determine the access control level for the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sinks, and similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show three different paths with varying depths:

1. **Path 1 (Depth 2)**: This path involves retrieving an `ApplicationInfo` object using `PackageManagerInternal` service, which requires system-level access or signature permission (`SYS_OR_SIG`). The method then checks if the application will be enabled based on the provided package name.

2. **Path 2 (Depth 1)**: In this path, `PlatformCompat.getApplicationInfo` is used to get the `ApplicationInfo`, and then it checks if the change will be enabled using `mCompatConfig.willChangeBeEnabled`. This also implies system-level or signature access due to the nature of accessing application information.

3. **Path 3 (Depth 0)**: This path simply delegates the call to another instance's method (`mPlatformCompat.isChangeEnabledByPackageName`), which suggests a dependency on external configuration but still requires system or signature level access for its operation.

The sinks provided also indicate interactions with `ApplicationInfo`, suggesting that the method deals with application-level data, which typically requires some form of access control.

Given these observations and looking at the similar APIs:

- **API Name: isChangeEnabledByPackageName(JLjava/lang/String;I)Z** has an Access Control Level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves getting `ApplicationInfo` and checking if a change will be enabled, which aligns with the operations in the paths provided for `isChangeEnabledByPackageName`.

- **API Name: isChangeEnabledByUid(JI)Z** also has an Access Control Level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and its operation involves checking if a change is enabled by UID, which similarly requires system or signature level access.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method should have an access control level that reflects the need for either system-level access or signature permission due to its interactions with application information and configuration checks.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is based on the method's involvement in accessing and manipulating sensitive application data, which typically requires elevated permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.
