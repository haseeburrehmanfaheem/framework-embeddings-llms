Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method.

The similar APIs all have a high similarity score (above 0.89) and are all related to TV input management or interactive app management. They all require a system or signature-level permission (`SYS_OR_SIG`) to access.

The `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method is also related to TV input management, as it dispatches surface changes to the TV input session. The method uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` to get the caller's UID and PID, which suggests that it is checking the caller's identity.

Given the similarities between the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method and the other APIs, I believe that it should also require a system or signature-level permission (`SYS_OR_SIG`) to access.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the fact that the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method is related to TV input management, which is a sensitive operation that requires system or signature-level permission. The similar APIs also require this level of permission, and the method's use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` suggests that it is checking the caller's identity, which is consistent with a system or signature-level permission requirement.
