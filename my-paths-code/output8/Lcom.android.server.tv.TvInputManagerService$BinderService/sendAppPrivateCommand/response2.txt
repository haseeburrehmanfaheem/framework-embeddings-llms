Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, it appears that the `sendAppPrivateCommand` method is related to TV input management and interactive app sessions. The similar APIs provided all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

The `sendAppPrivateCommand` method seems to be performing a similar operation, sending a private command to an app, which could potentially affect the TV input session or interactive app behavior. Given the similarities in code structure and the presence of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` calls, it is likely that this method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `sendAppPrivateCommand` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
