To determine the access control level for the `selectTrack` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `selectTrack` method has three different paths with varying depths, but they all share a common pattern:

1. They retrieve the calling user's ID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
2. They resolve the calling user's ID using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` or `TvInputManagerService.resolveCallingUserId()`.
3. They acquire a lock using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock(this.this$0)` or `this.mLock`.
4. They retrieve an `ITvInputSession` object using `TvInputManagerService.getSessionStateLocked()` or `TvInputManagerService.getSessionLocked()`.
5. They call the `selectTrack()` method on the `ITvInputSession` object.

The similar APIs provided, `notifyTrackSelected` and `removeOverlayView`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with the `ITvInputSession` object and perform operations that require system or signature-level permissions.

Based on the similarities between the `selectTrack` method and the provided APIs, it is likely that the `selectTrack` method requires system or signature-level permissions to function correctly. Therefore, the access control level for the `selectTrack` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
