Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. The `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` method also interacts with sensitive TV input sessions and requires the `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` calls to verify the caller's identity.

Given the similarities in code structure and the requirement for secure access, I conclude that the `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` method should have a similar access control level.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities with other APIs and the need to protect sensitive TV input sessions from unauthorized access.
