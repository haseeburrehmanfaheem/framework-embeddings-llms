To determine the access control level for the `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs.

All three code paths for `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` involve the following steps:
1. Retrieving the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
2. Resolving the calling user ID through either `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` or `resolveCallingUserId`.
3. Acquiring a session state or session locked object.
4. Setting the interactive app notification enabled status via `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` on an `ITvInputSession` object.

The similar APIs provided, `setTeletextAppEnabled` and `notifyError`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Their code snippets also involve:
- Retrieving the calling UID and PID.
- Resolving the user ID.
- Interacting with session states or sessions to perform specific actions (`setTeletextAppEnabled` for one, `notifyError` for the other).

Given these similarities in both the method's implementation details and the access control levels of similar APIs, it suggests that `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` is also subject to system or signature-level protection. This level of protection typically applies to methods that can impact system functionality or user data privacy and security, requiring either system-level permissions or a signature match with the package that owns the method.

Therefore, considering the patterns observed in similar APIs and the nature of the operations performed by `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
