To determine the access control level for the `requestChannelBrowsable` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `requestChannelBrowsable` API sends a broadcast intent with the action `"android.media.tv.action.CHANNEL_BROWSABLE_REQUESTED"` and extras containing the channel ID and package name. This intent is sent using `sendBroadcastAsUser`, which allows the broadcast to be sent on behalf of a specific user.

The similar APIs, `notifyResourceGranted(II)V`, also send broadcast intents, but with different actions and extras. They require the permission `"android.permission.RECEIVE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_USAGE"` to receive the broadcast.

After analyzing the code and comparing it with the similar APIs, we can conclude that the `requestChannelBrowsable` API does not require any specific permission to send the broadcast intent. The API is used to notify other components about a channel being browsable, which is a normal operation in the context of TV input management.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the access control level for the `requestChannelBrowsable` API should be `NONE`, as it does not require any specific permission or access control to perform its intended function.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
