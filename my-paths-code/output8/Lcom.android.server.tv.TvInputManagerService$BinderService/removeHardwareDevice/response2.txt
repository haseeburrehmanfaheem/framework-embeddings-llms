To determine the access control level for the `removeHardwareDevice` method, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with similar APIs.

The `removeHardwareDevice` method is used to remove a hardware device from the TV input manager service. It takes an integer parameter `p1`, which represents the ID of the device to be removed. The method first checks if the device exists in the connections list, and if so, it resets the device, removes it from the list, and updates the hardware list.

The sink code for this method is `TvInputHardwareManager v1 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmTvInputHardwareManager(this.this$0); v1.onDeviceUnavailable(p1);`, which indicates that the method notifies the TV input hardware manager that a device is no longer available.

Comparing this method with similar APIs, we can see that:

* `getHardwareList()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that accessing the hardware list requires system or signature-level permission.
* `captureFrame()` and `getAvailableTvStreamConfigList()` also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that capturing frames and getting available TV stream configurations require system or signature-level permission.
* `addHardwareDevice()` has an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that adding a hardware device does not require any special permission.

However, removing a hardware device is a more sensitive operation than adding one, as it can potentially disrupt the functioning of the TV input manager service. Therefore, it is likely that removing a hardware device requires some level of permission or access control.

Based on the similarity with `getHardwareList()`, `captureFrame()`, and `getAvailableTvStreamConfigList()`, which all require system or signature-level permission, it is reasonable to conclude that `removeHardwareDevice()` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level components can remove hardware devices, preventing unauthorized or malicious removal of devices.
