To determine the access control level for the `removeHardwareDevice` API, let's analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Path 1 involves removing a hardware device by resetting its connection, updating the hardware list, and potentially sending messages to handle HDMI devices.
   - Path 2 simplifies this process but still involves resetting connections and handling HDMI devices based on their port IDs.
   - Path 3 directly calls `onDeviceUnavailable` on the `TvInputHardwareManager`, which is a straightforward approach to notify about device unavailability.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `getHardwareList()` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves the list of hardware devices, which implies it needs system or signature-level permission to access such sensitive information.
   - The `captureFrame` API also has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This method involves capturing frames from a TV input, which could require system-level permissions due to its potential impact on system resources and privacy.

3. **Comparison and Decision**:
   - Both similar APIs have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating they deal with sensitive operations or data that require elevated permissions.
   - The `removeHardwareDevice` API, despite its variations in code paths, fundamentally deals with managing TV input hardware devices. This management could involve system-level resources and configurations, suggesting it might need similar protection.
   - Given the nature of the operation (removing a hardware device), which could potentially impact system functionality or user data privacy, assigning an access control level that ensures only authorized components can perform such actions is prudent.

Based on this analysis, the `removeHardwareDevice` API should have an access control level that reflects its potential to interact with system-level resources and configurations. Therefore, it's reasonable to assign it a similar access control level as the compared APIs.

**Access Control Level Decision**:
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
This decision aligns with the need to protect system resources and user privacy by ensuring that only components with system or signature-level permissions can remove hardware devices, thus maintaining the integrity and security of the TV input system.
