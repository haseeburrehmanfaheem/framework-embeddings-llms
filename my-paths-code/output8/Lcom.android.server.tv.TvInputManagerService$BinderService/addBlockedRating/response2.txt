To determine the access control level for the `addBlockedRating` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0) that essentially perform the same operation: adding a blocked TV content rating to the user's settings. This involves unflattening the rating string into a `TvContentRating` object and then adding it to the list of blocked ratings stored in `PersistentDataStore`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `TvContentRating` objects and `PersistentDataStore`, specifically adding blocked ratings.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two instances of `removeBlockedRating` are provided, both with high similarity scores to `addBlockedRating`. Both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The operations in these similar APIs involve removing a blocked TV content rating, which is the inverse operation of adding one but still deals with modifying user settings related to blocked content ratings.

Given this information:

- **Similarity and Semantics**: The similarity between `addBlockedRating` and `removeBlockedRating` suggests that they are part of a cohesive set of APIs managing blocked TV content ratings. The semantic similarity in their operations (adding vs. removing) implies that they should have similar access control considerations, as both modify user preferences or settings.

- **Access Control Levels**:
  - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose any security risk.
  - `NORMAL`: Used for methods that require some level of protection but are generally safe if called by normal applications.
  - `DANGEROUS`: Applies to methods that could potentially cause harm or violate user privacy if misused.
  - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system or signature-protected methods, indicating a higher level of access control is required.

Considering the above points and the fact that both similar APIs (`removeBlockedRating`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that modifying blocked TV content ratings (either adding or removing) should be protected at a similar level. This protection ensures that only authorized applications (those signed with the platform key or running as system processes) can modify these settings, preventing unauthorized changes by third-party apps.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the access control levels of related APIs, the `addBlockedRating` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
