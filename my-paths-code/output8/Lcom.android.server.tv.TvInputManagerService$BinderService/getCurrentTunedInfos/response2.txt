Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `getCurrentTunedInfos` API.

The `getCurrentTunedInfos` API is used to retrieve a list of tuned infos for the current user. The API has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them involve resolving the calling user ID and retrieving the user state locked.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `getTvInputState` has an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that getting the TV input state does not require any specific permissions.
* `requestBroadcastInfo` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that requesting broadcast info requires system or signature-level permission.
* `getBlockedRatings` has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that getting blocked ratings does not require any specific permissions.
* `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList` has an access control level of `NONE`, which implies that getting the TV interactive app service list does not require any specific permissions.
* `timeShiftPause` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that pausing time shift requires system or signature-level permission.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `getCurrentTunedInfos` API, it appears that retrieving tuned infos is a relatively innocuous operation that does not require high-level permissions. However, since the API involves resolving the calling user ID and retrieving the user state locked, some level of access control is necessary to prevent unauthorized access.

Given this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getCurrentTunedInfos` API, as it requires some level of permission but not as high as system or signature-level permission.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
