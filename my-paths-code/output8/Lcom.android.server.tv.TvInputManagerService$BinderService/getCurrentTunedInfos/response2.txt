To determine the access control level for the `getCurrentTunedInfos` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The first similar API is `getTvInputState(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with an access control level of `NONE`. This method seems to retrieve the state of a TV input based on its ID and user ID, which doesn't inherently imply sensitive operations.
   - The second similar API is `requestBroadcastInfo(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/media/tv/BroadcastInfoRequest;I)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves requesting broadcast information, which might require higher privileges due to the nature of handling broadcast requests.

2. **Analysis of getCurrentTunedInfos:**
   - The `getCurrentTunedInfos` method appears to retrieve a list of tuned infos based on certain conditions and user state. It interacts with the TV input manager service, resolves the calling user ID, and fetches or creates a user state before proceeding.
   - The method involves operations like checking the current channel, recording session status, and visibility, which are related to TV input management but do not directly imply sensitive operations that would require `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions based on the provided code snippets.

3. **Access Control Decision:**
   - Given the nature of the method and comparing it with the similar APIs, `getCurrentTunedInfos` seems to be more aligned with operations that do not require high-level permissions like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The closest match in terms of functionality and potential impact is `getTvInputState`, which has an access control level of `NONE`. However, considering the method's interaction with user states and session information, it might still require some form of access control to prevent unauthorized access to TV input states.
   - Between `NORMAL` and `NONE`, given that there are checks for calling user ID and operations that could potentially reveal user-specific data (though not explicitly sensitive), a cautious approach would lean towards requiring some level of access control, but the provided information does not strongly indicate a need for `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` levels.

**Conclusion:**
Given the analysis above and considering the method's functionality, similar APIs, and the nature of operations involved, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects a balance between allowing legitimate access to TV input information while maintaining some level of protection against unauthorized or malicious use.
