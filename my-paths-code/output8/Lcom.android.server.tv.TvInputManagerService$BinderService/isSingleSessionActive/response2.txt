To determine the access control level for the `isSingleSessionActive` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `releaseSession`: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `timeShiftResume`: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `getTvInputState`: NONE
4. `setParentalControlsEnabled`: SYS_OR_SIG
5. `setSurface`: SYS_OR_SIG

These APIs interact with the TvInputManagerService, which suggests that they are related to TV input management. The `isSingleSessionActive` method seems to be checking if a single session is active for a given user, which could be related to managing TV input sessions.

The similarities between `isSingleSessionActive` and the other APIs range from 0.9097 to 0.9329, indicating that they share some commonalities in their code structure or functionality.

Given that most of the similar APIs (4 out of 5) have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, it suggests that these methods are considered sensitive and require a certain level of permission or signature to be accessed. The only exception is `getTvInputState`, which has an access control level of NONE, implying that it is not as sensitive.

However, considering the nature of `isSingleSessionActive` and its interaction with user sessions and TV input management, it's reasonable to infer that this method might also require some level of access control. Since it's a getter method (checking the state of something), it might not need as strict access control as setter methods (which modify states). But given the similarities with other SYS_OR_SIG methods, assigning it a level of NONE might be too permissive.

Therefore, considering the balance between the sensitivity of the information it accesses and the principle that getter methods generally require less restrictive access control than setter methods, but also taking into account the similarities with other methods that are classified as SYS_OR_SIG, the most appropriate access control level for `isSingleSessionActive` would be NORMAL. This choice reflects a moderate level of restriction, acknowledging the method's interaction with potentially sensitive user session information without requiring the highest level of signature or system permission.
