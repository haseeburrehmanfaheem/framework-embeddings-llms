Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `isSingleSessionActive` method.

The method interacts with the following sinks:

1. `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`: This is a system-level API that handles incoming user requests.
2. `TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked`: This API retrieves the user state for a given user ID.
3. `TvInputManagerService$UserState.getSessionStateMap`: This API retrieves the session state map for a given user state.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Considering the semantics of the `isSingleSessionActive` method, it appears to be checking whether a single session is active for a given user ID. This method does not seem to modify any system-level state or perform any sensitive operations.

However, since the method interacts with system-level APIs and retrieves user state information, it is likely that it requires some level of access control.

Given the similarity scores with the provided APIs, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `isSingleSessionActive` method.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `isSingleSessionActive` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

Note: The assigned access control level is `NORMAL`, as the method does not seem to require system or signature-level permissions, but rather a normal level of access control. However, this decision may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the system. 

In general, `SYS_OR_SIG` is used when an API can be called by system apps or apps with specific signatures. If `isSingleSessionActive` can be called by any app without restrictions, then `NORMAL` would be a suitable choice. But if it requires some kind of restriction (like being a system app), `SYS_OR_SIG` could also be considered. 

Without more context about the actual usage and requirements of this API, `NORMAL` seems like a reasonable default choice.
