To determine the access control level for the `removeBroadcastInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The similar APIs (`requestBroadcastInfo`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permission to access.

2. **Code Snippets for Paths:**
   - All paths (1, 2, and 3) for the `removeBroadcastInfo` method involve checking the calling user ID through `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` or `resolveCallingUserId`. This implies that the method is designed to handle user-specific data or actions, which often requires careful access control.
   - The method interacts with `TvInputManagerService$SessionState` and `ITvInputSession`, indicating it deals with TV input sessions, which could involve sensitive operations like removing broadcast information.

3. **Sink Code:**
   - The sink code snippets show interactions with session states and removal of broadcast info (`v12.removeBroadcastInfo(p2)`), reinforcing the notion that this method performs actions on user-specific or system-level resources.

Given these points, assigning an access control level to `removeBroadcastInfo` should consider the sensitivity of the operation (removing broadcast information) and the similarity with other APIs that have been classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`. Since removing broadcast information could potentially impact system functionality or user experience, and considering the method's interaction with system-level components, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also requires a similar level of access control.

**Conclusion:**

The final access control level for the API should be `SYS_OR_SIG` due to its similarity in functionality and security requirements with other classified APIs, and because it interacts with sensitive system resources.
