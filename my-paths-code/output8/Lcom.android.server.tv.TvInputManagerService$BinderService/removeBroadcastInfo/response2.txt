To determine the access control level for the `removeBroadcastInfo` method, we should consider the similarities and access control levels of the provided similar APIs.

1. **Similarity and Access Control**:
   - The most similar APIs (`requestBroadcastInfo`, `releaseSession`, `removeOverlayView`, and `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to broadcast info, session management, and overlay views are considered sensitive and require a system or signature-level permission to execute.
   - The `getBlockedRatings` method has an access control level of `NONE`, but its functionality is more related to retrieving information rather than modifying system or application states. This difference in functionality (reading vs. writing/modifying) aligns with the general principle that reading data is less sensitive than writing or modifying it.

2. **Method's Functionality**:
   - The `removeBroadcastInfo` method modifies the broadcast info associated with a session, which implies a level of sensitivity similar to that of managing sessions or overlay views. Modifying such information could potentially impact the system's behavior or user experience, suggesting that some level of restriction is necessary.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Given that the method involves modifying data (in this case, removing broadcast info), it should have at least the same level of protection as the similar methods that also modify system or application states.
   - The principle that writing/modifying operations generally require higher access control levels than reading operations supports assigning a restrictive access control level to `removeBroadcastInfo`.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for the `removeBroadcastInfo` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the protection levels of similar methods that modify system or application states and reflects the sensitivity of the operation being performed.
