To determine the access control level for the `requestBroadcastInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0) that all eventually lead to calling `requestBroadcastInfo` on an `ITvInputSession` object. Each path involves getting the calling user ID and then using it to get or create a user state and session state before accessing the `ITvInputSession`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `ActivityManager`, `TvInputManagerService`, and `ITvInputSession`. These interactions involve resolving the calling user ID, getting or creating user and session states, and finally calling `requestBroadcastInfo` on an `ITvInputSession`.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided: `removeBroadcastInfo(Landroid/os/IBinder;II)V`, each with a high similarity score to `requestBroadcastInfo`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code for these similar APIs shows a pattern similar to `requestBroadcastInfo`, involving user ID resolution, session state management, and interaction with `ITvInputSession`.

Given this information:

- **Similarity in Code and Functionality**: The `requestBroadcastInfo` method and its similar APIs (`removeBroadcastInfo`) share similarities in how they handle user IDs, session states, and interactions with `ITvInputSession`. This suggests that the access control considerations for these methods are likely aligned due to their comparable operational contexts.

- **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both provided similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This level typically indicates that the API can be accessed by system or signature applications, suggesting that the operations performed by these APIs (and potentially `requestBroadcastInfo`) are sensitive and should be restricted to trusted components.

- **Nature of the Operation**: The operation of requesting broadcast info involves interacting with TV input sessions and managing user states, which could imply handling sensitive data or capabilities. Thus, restricting access to system or signature applications seems reasonable to prevent unauthorized or malicious use.

Based on these considerations, it's logical to conclude that `requestBroadcastInfo` should have a similar access control level to its highly similar counterparts, especially given the shared patterns in code and functionality.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This conclusion is drawn from the method's operational similarity to other APIs with known access control levels, the nature of the operations being performed, and the importance of restricting such operations to trusted system or signature applications.
