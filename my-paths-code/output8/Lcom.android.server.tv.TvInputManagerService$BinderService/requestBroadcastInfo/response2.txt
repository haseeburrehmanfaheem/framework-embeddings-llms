Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `requestBroadcastInfo` method.

The `requestBroadcastInfo` method has a high similarity with `removeBroadcastInfo` and `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `requestBroadcastInfo` method may also require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the `releaseSession` method, which has a similarity of 0.8933985233306885 with `requestBroadcastInfo`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that `requestBroadcastInfo` may require a higher level of access control.

On the other hand, the `getTvInputState` and `unregisterAppLinkInfo` methods have lower similarities with `requestBroadcastInfo` and have access control levels of `NONE`. However, these methods appear to be related to retrieving or unregistering information, which may not require the same level of access control as modifying or requesting broadcast information.

Considering the similarities and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I believe that the `requestBroadcastInfo` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method appears to be related to requesting broadcast information, which may require a higher level of access control to ensure that only authorized entities can request such information.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
