To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` API has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve the following key steps:

1. Getting the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
2. Handling the incoming user using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` or `resolveCallingUserId()`.
3. Getting the user state locked using `TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked()` or `getOrCreateUserStateLocked()`.
4. Accessing the input map and retrieving an object based on the provided parameter `p1`.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getTvInputInfo(Ljava/lang/String;I)Landroid/media/tv/TvInputInfo;` with an access control level of `NONE`. This API also involves getting the calling UID and PID, handling the incoming user, and accessing the user state locked.
2. `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled(Landroid/os/IBinder;ZI)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API involves getting the calling UID and PID, handling the incoming user, and accessing a session state locked.

Comparing the code and semantics of these APIs, we can observe that:

* The `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` API is similar to `getTvInputInfo` in terms of its functionality and access control patterns. Both APIs are focused on retrieving information and do not perform any sensitive operations.
* The `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` API has a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`) because it involves setting a notification enabled state, which is a more sensitive operation.

Based on this analysis, the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` API seems to be more similar to `getTvInputInfo` in terms of its functionality and access control patterns. Therefore, it is likely that the access control level for `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` should be `NONE`, as it is primarily focused on retrieving information and does not perform any sensitive operations.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
