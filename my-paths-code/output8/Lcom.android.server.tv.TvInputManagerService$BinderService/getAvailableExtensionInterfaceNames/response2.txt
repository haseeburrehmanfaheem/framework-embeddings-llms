To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `getTvInputInfo`: This API has a similarity of 0.9376492500305176 and an access control level of NONE.
2. `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`: This API has a similarity of 0.9311877489089966 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
3. `unregisterCallback`: This API has a similarity of 0.9113031625747681 and an access control level of NONE.
4. `notifySignalStrength`: This API has a similarity of 0.9078304767608643 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
5. `setTeletextAppEnabled`: This API has a similarity of 0.8996322154998779 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

The `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` method is a getter method, which generally requires less restrictive access control compared to setter methods. However, it's essential to consider the sensitivity of the data being accessed.

Given that the most similar API, `getTvInputInfo`, has an access control level of NONE, and considering that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, we can infer that the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` method likely requires a relatively low access control level.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of NONE to the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is made considering the similarities with other APIs and the general principle that getter methods typically require less restrictive access control than setter methods. However, it's crucial to note that this assessment might need to be adjusted based on specific requirements or constraints of the Android system or the TvInputManagerService that are not provided in the given information.
