Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `removeBlockedRating` method.

The `removeBlockedRating` method is used to remove a blocked content rating from the TV input manager service. This operation modifies the system's state and potentially affects the user experience.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `addBlockedRating`: This method has a similarity of 0.9854539036750793 with `removeBlockedRating` and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that adding or removing blocked ratings requires a similar level of access control.
2. `isRatingBlocked`: This method has a lower similarity (0.8503305315971375) and has an access control level of `NONE`. However, this method only checks if a rating is blocked and does not modify the system's state.
3. `getBlockedRatings` and `getTvContentRatingSystemList`: These methods have lower similarities and access control levels of `NONE` and `SYS_OR_SIG`, respectively. While they provide information about blocked ratings or TV content rating systems, they do not modify the system's state.

Considering the similarities and access control levels of these APIs, I conclude that the `removeBlockedRating` method should have an access control level similar to `addBlockedRating`, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that modifying the system's state by removing a blocked content rating requires a sufficient level of access control.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the importance of controlling access to system modifications, such as removing blocked content ratings, to maintain the security and integrity of the TV input manager service.
