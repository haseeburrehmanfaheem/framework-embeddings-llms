To determine the access control level for the `removeBlockedRating` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The API has three different paths with varying depths, but they all essentially perform the same operation: removing a blocked rating from a user's state based on the input parameters (`p1` and `p2`). The critical parts involve checking the calling user ID, getting or creating a user state, unflattening the content rating string, and then removing this rating if it exists.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show how the API interacts with sensitive operations, specifically the removal of blocked ratings (`TvContentRating`) from a user's persistent data store. This interaction involves unflattening a string to a `TvContentRating` object and then removing it from the blocked ratings list.

3. **Similar APIs**: The provided similar APIs are both named `addBlockedRating`, with high similarity scores (0.9854538440704346 and 0.924991250038147). Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Their operations involve adding a blocked rating based on the input string, which is somewhat the inverse operation of `removeBlockedRating`.

Given this information:

- **Similarity with Other APIs**: The similarity in functionality (though opposite in action) and the high similarity scores suggest that `removeBlockedRating` should have a comparable access control level to its similar APIs (`addBlockedRating`). Since adding or removing blocked ratings both deal with modifying user preferences or restrictions on content, they likely require similar levels of permission or authorization.

- **Sensitive Operations**: The interaction with sensitive data (user's blocked content ratings) and the need to verify the calling user ID suggest that this operation should not be freely accessible. Thus, an access control level of `NONE` seems inappropriate.

- **Access Control Choices**:
  - `NONE`: Implies no restriction on access, which doesn't fit well with operations involving user-specific data.
  - `NORMAL`: Suggests a basic level of protection but might not fully address the sensitivity of managing blocked content ratings.
  - `DANGEROUS`: Indicates a higher risk operation. While removing a blocked rating does modify user preferences, it's not typically classified as dangerous in terms of Android permissions (e.g., doesn't directly access location, contacts, etc.).
  - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Requires the calling app to be either a system app or signed with the same certificate as the app defining the API, indicating a high level of trust and privilege.

Considering these points, especially the similarity in functionality with `addBlockedRating` APIs (which both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`) and the nature of the operation involving user-specific content restrictions, it's reasonable to conclude that `removeBlockedRating` should also require a similar level of authorization.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This choice reflects the need for a high level of trust and privilege when modifying user preferences regarding blocked content ratings, aligning with the access control levels assigned to its similar APIs.
