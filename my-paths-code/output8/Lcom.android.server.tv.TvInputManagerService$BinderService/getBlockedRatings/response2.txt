To determine the access control level for the `getBlockedRatings` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `isRatingBlocked`: NONE
   - `setParentalControlsEnabled`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `getTvInputState`: NONE
   - `unregisterAppLinkInfo`: NONE
   - `isSingleSessionActive`: SYS_OR_SIG

2. **Semantics of the APIs**:
   - The method in question, `getBlockedRatings`, retrieves a list of blocked content ratings for a specific user.
   - This operation involves reading data related to parental controls or content restrictions.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, reading data (getter methods) is considered less sensitive than modifying it (setter methods).
   - If a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level because writing data usually poses a greater security risk.

Given these points:

- The `getBlockedRatings` method is a getter method that retrieves information about blocked content ratings. This operation does not modify any system settings but rather provides information.
- Among the similar APIs, those that are also getters (`isRatingBlocked`, `getTvInputState`) have an access control level of NONE, suggesting that reading such information may not require high-level permissions in this context.
- However, operations that modify parental controls or session states (`setParentalControlsEnabled`, `isSingleSessionActive`) have higher access control levels (SYS_OR_SIG), indicating that modifications to these settings are more restricted.

Considering the principle that getter methods typically require less stringent access control than setter methods and looking at the similar APIs provided, it seems reasonable to conclude that `getBlockedRatings` should have a relatively low access control level since it's a read operation related to content restrictions.

Therefore, based on the information and analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision aligns with the treatment of similar getter methods in the provided context, reflecting the general principle that reading data is less sensitive than writing it.
