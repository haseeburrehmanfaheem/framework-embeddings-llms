To determine the access control level for the `getBlockedRatings` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of `getBlockedRatings` involve getting the calling user ID through `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` or `resolveCallingUserId`, which suggests a consideration for user-specific data access.
   - They also involve creating or getting a `TvInputManagerService$UserState` object, which is used to manage TV input settings for a specific user.
   - The method retrieves blocked ratings from the `PersistentDataStore` associated with the user state and returns them as a list of strings.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isRatingBlocked**: This API has a similarity score of 0.9352520704269409 with `getBlockedRatings`. It checks if a specific rating is blocked for a given user ID, and its access control level is `NONE`.
   - **setParentalControlsEnabled**: With a similarity score of 0.927176296710968, this API enables or disables parental controls for a user. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `getBlockedRatings` deals with retrieving user-specific blocked ratings and considering the similarity with `isRatingBlocked` (which has an access control level of `NONE`), one might initially think `getBlockedRatings` could have a similar access control level.
   - However, the method's interaction with user-specific data and the need to manage TV input settings suggest a requirement for some level of access control to protect user privacy and settings integrity.
   - Comparing with `setParentalControlsEnabled`, which has a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`), we see that modifying parental controls (a related but distinct operation) requires more stringent permissions.
   - Given the nature of `getBlockedRatings` as an information retrieval method rather than a setting modification method, and considering its similarities with `isRatingBlocked`, it's reasonable to conclude that `getBlockedRatings` does not require as high a level of access control as `setParentalControlsEnabled`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The method `getBlockedRatings` is primarily about retrieving information (blocked ratings) for a user, which aligns more closely with the nature of `isRatingBlocked` than with the setting modification nature of `setParentalControlsEnabled`.
   - Therefore, considering the similarities and the nature of the operations involved, the access control level for `getBlockedRatings` should be aligned with information retrieval APIs that do not modify system settings or sensitive data.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's primary function of retrieving user-specific blocked ratings without modifying any system settings, similar to `isRatingBlocked`, and considering the need for a balanced approach between data protection and accessibility of non-sensitive information.
