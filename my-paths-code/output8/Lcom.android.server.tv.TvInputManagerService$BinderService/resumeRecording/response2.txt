Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `resumeRecording` method.

The `resumeRecording` method has a high similarity with other methods that have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods include:

* `pauseRecording`: Similarity 0.969141960144043
* `timeShiftSeekTo`: Similarity 0.8536069393157959, 0.8327041268348694, and 0.8143297433853149
* `stopRecording`: Similarity 0.8469374775886536, 0.8374797701835632, and 0.835206151008606
* `startRecording`: Similarity 0.8400400280952454

All of these methods have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

Additionally, the `resumeRecording` method interacts with the same sink code as these similar methods, which further supports the assignment of an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their assigned access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `resumeRecording` method.
