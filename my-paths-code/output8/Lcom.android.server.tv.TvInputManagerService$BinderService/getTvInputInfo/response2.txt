To determine the access control level for the `getTvInputInfo` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getTvInputInfo` API has three paths, all of which involve checking the calling user's ID using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`, followed by resolving the calling user ID using either `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` or `resolveCallingUserId()`. This suggests that the API is performing some form of user authentication or authorization.

The similar APIs provided, `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled` and `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also involve checking the calling user's ID and resolving the calling user ID using similar methods.

Given the similarities in code and functionality between `getTvInputInfo` and the provided similar APIs, it is likely that `getTvInputInfo` requires a similar level of access control. Therefore, based on the analysis, the access control level for the `getTvInputInfo` API should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
