Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `getTvInputInfo` API.

The `getTvInputInfo` API has a similarity score of over 0.9 with several APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs include `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`, `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames`, and `releaseTvInputHardware`. This suggests that the `getTvInputInfo` API is likely to require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the `getTvInputInfo` API is a getter method, which typically requires less restrictive access control than setter methods. However, since the corresponding setter methods (e.g., `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is likely that the `getTvInputInfo` API also requires a similar level of access control to maintain consistency and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the similarity scores and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getTvInputInfo` API.

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
