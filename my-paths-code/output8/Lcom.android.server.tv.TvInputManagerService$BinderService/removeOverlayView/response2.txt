Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `removeOverlayView` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to TV input management and interactive app management, and they all involve handling sessions, overlay views, and media views.

The `removeOverlayView` method is also related to TV input management and involves removing an overlay view from a session. The sink code entries for this method show that it uses similar logic to the other APIs, including resolving the calling user ID and getting the session state locked.

Given the similarities between the `removeOverlayView` method and the other APIs, I believe that it should have the same access control level as the others, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because removing an overlay view from a session could potentially impact the security and functionality of the TV input management system, and therefore requires system or signature-level permission to access.

Here is the final access control level for the `removeOverlayView` method in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
