To determine the access control level for the `removeOverlayView` method, we should consider the similarities with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The provided similar APIs are `createOverlayView` and `relayoutOverlayView`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to overlay views in the context of TV input management are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.

2. **Code Semantics**: The code snippets for all paths of `removeOverlayView` involve getting the calling user ID, handling incoming users, and then performing actions on a session locked by the provided binder and user IDs. This implies that the method is designed to manage sessions based on user identities, which is a security-sensitive operation.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves resolving the calling user ID, getting a session state or session locked, and then removing an overlay view. These operations are similar in nature to those found in `createOverlayView` and `relayoutOverlayView`, reinforcing the notion that they should be protected at a similar level.

Given these considerations:

- The method interacts with sensitive components related to user sessions and overlay views.
- Similar APIs (`createOverlayView` and `relayoutOverlayView`) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating that such operations require significant permissions.

Therefore, the `removeOverlayView` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` due to its similarity in functionality and security implications with other APIs in this context.
