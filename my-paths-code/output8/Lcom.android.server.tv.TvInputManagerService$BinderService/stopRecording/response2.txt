Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, it appears that the `stopRecording` method in the `TvInputManagerService$BinderService` class is related to TV input management and session control.

The similar APIs provided, such as `removeOverlayView`, `selectTrack`, `timeShiftResume`, `startRecording`, and `releaseSession`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are considered sensitive and require a system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `stopRecording` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `stopRecording` method also requires a similar level of access control. Therefore, the assigned access control level for the `stopRecording` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
