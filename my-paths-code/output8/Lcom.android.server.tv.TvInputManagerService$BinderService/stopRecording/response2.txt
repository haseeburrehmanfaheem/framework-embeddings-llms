To determine the access control level for the `stopRecording` method, we need to analyze its code snippets and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `stopRecording` method has three paths with different depths, but they all share a common pattern:

1. They call `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` to get the UID and PID of the calling process.
2. They resolve the calling user ID using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` or `resolveCallingUserId()`.
3. They acquire a lock using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock()` or `this.mLock`.
4. They retrieve an `ITvInputSession` object using `TvInputManagerService.getSessionLocked()` or `getSessionStateLocked()`.
5. They call the `stopRecording()` method on the `ITvInputSession` object.

The similar APIs, `removeOverlayView` and `selectTrack`, have a similar pattern:

1. They also call `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
2. They resolve the calling user ID using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()`.
3. They acquire a lock using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock()`.
4. They retrieve an `ITvInputSession` object using `TvInputManagerService.getSessionLocked()` or `getSessionStateLocked()`.
5. They call a method on the `ITvInputSession` object (`removeOverlayView()` or `selectTrack()`).

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access the TV input session.

Given the similarities between the `stopRecording` method and the provided APIs, it is likely that the `stopRecording` method also requires system or signature-level permission to access the TV input session. Therefore, the access control level for the `stopRecording` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
