Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `setCaptionEnabled` method.

The `setCaptionEnabled` method has a high similarity with other methods that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods include:

* `selectTrack(Landroid/os/IBinder;ILjava/lang/String;I)V`
* `notifyTrackSelected(Landroid/os/IBinder;ILjava/lang/String;I)V`
* `removeOverlayView(Landroid/os/IBinder;I)V`
* `stopRecording(Landroid/os/IBinder;I)V`
* `relayoutMediaView(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/graphics/Rect;I)V`

All of these methods have a similarity score above 0.88, which indicates that they are very similar to the `setCaptionEnabled` method. Additionally, they all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.

Given this information, I conclude that the `setCaptionEnabled` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because it appears to be modifying sensitive data related to TV input sessions, and therefore requires a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized changes.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
