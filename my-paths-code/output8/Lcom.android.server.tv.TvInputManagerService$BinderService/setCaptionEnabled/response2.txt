To determine the access control level for the `setCaptionEnabled` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) but all essentially perform the same operation: enabling or disabling captions for a TV input session after resolving the calling user ID and obtaining the necessary session state.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `ActivityManager` to handle incoming users, retrieval of session states, and ultimately setting the caption enabled status on an `ITvInputSession` object.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `selectTrack(Landroid/os/IBinder;ILjava/lang/String;I)V`: This method has a high similarity score (0.9046578407287598) with `setCaptionEnabled`. It is involved in selecting tracks for TV input sessions and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `notifyTrackSelected(Landroid/os/IBinder;ILjava/lang/String;I)V`: With a similarity score of 0.8937032222747803, this method notifies about track selection for interactive TV app sessions and also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these points:

- The operations performed by `setCaptionEnabled` are closely related to managing TV input sessions, which involves system-level functionality.
- Both similar APIs (`selectTrack` and `notifyTrackSelected`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. This suggests that operations affecting TV input sessions are considered sensitive and thus restricted.
- The method's interactions with `ActivityManager` for user handling and session management further imply a need for elevated access control.

Based on the analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the `setCaptionEnabled` method should have an access control level similar to its counterparts involved in TV input session management. Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination aligns with the system's need to protect sensitive operations related to TV input sessions and ensures that only authorized (system or signature-level permission holding) components can modify caption settings.
