Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control levels of similar APIs to determine the appropriate level for the `getTvContentRatingSystemList` method.

The similar APIs provided have the following access control levels:

* `isRatingBlocked`: NONE
* `getBlockedRatings`: NONE
* `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList`: NONE
* `getTvInputState`: NONE
* `timeShiftResume`: SYS_OR_SIG (this one is different from the others, as it requires a higher level of access control)

The `getTvContentRatingSystemList` method is similar to the other APIs in terms of its functionality, which involves retrieving information about TV content rating systems. The method does not seem to pose any significant security risks, as it only returns a list of content rating systems.

Considering the similarities with the other APIs and the relatively low security risk associated with this method, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getTvContentRatingSystemList` method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
