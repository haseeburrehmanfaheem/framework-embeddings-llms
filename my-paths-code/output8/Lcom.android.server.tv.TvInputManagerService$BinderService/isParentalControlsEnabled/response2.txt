Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `isParentalControlsEnabled` method.

The `isParentalControlsEnabled` method is a getter method that returns a boolean value indicating whether parental controls are enabled. The method does not modify any data and only reads the current state of parental controls.

The similar APIs provided have varying levels of similarity, but most of them have an access control level of `NONE`. However, one API, `setMainSession`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that modifying the main session requires system or signature-level permission.

Considering the semantics of the `isParentalControlsEnabled` method and the fact that it only reads data, I believe that a lower access control level is sufficient. Since reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and most similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, I will assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `isParentalControlsEnabled` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment takes into account the principle that if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level. In this case, since the `isParentalControlsEnabled` method only reads data and does not modify it, a lower access control level of `NORMAL` is sufficient.
