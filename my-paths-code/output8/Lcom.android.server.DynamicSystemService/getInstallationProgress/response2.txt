To determine the access control level for the `getInstallationProgress` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

All three paths of the `getInstallationProgress` method involve interacting with the `IGsiService` interface, which is obtained through `ServiceManager.waitForService("gsiservice")`. This interaction is also present in the similar APIs (`finishInstallation()` and `isEnabled()`), which have an access control level of `NONE`.

The key aspect to consider here is that these methods are accessing a service that seems to be related to the Global System Image (GSI) installation progress or status. The fact that they all use `ServiceManager.waitForService("gsiservice")` suggests they are part of a system-level functionality, possibly not directly accessible or controllable by regular applications without proper permissions.

However, given that both similar APIs (`finishInstallation()` and `isEnabled()`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it implies that the operations involved in these methods (including the interaction with the GSI service) are considered to be at a level of access control that does not pose significant risks or require special permissions beyond what is normally granted.

Considering this, the `getInstallationProgress` method, which essentially retrieves information about the installation progress without performing any actions that could potentially alter system state in dangerous ways (like installing or uninstalling software), would likely fall under a similar category of access control.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its operations, the final access control level for the `getInstallationProgress` API can be determined as follows:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This determination is made considering that the method's functionality aligns closely with information retrieval rather than system modification or sensitive data exposure, which would require higher levels of access control.
