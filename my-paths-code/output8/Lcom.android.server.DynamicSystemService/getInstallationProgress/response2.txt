Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will analyze the access control level for the `getInstallationProgress` method.

The `getInstallationProgress` method is a getter method that retrieves the installation progress of a GSI (Generic System Image) service. The method interacts with the `IGsiService` interface, which is used to manage GSI services.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require any specific access control restrictions. These APIs include:

* `finishInstallation()Z`: closes the installation of a GSI service
* `isEnabled()Z`: checks if the GSI service is enabled
* `suggestScratchSize()J`: suggests a scratch size for the GSI service
* `abort()Z`: cancels the GSI installation
* `setAshmem(Landroid/os/ParcelFileDescriptor;J)Z`: sets the ashmem (anonymous shared memory) for the GSI service

All of these APIs interact with the `IGsiService` interface, similar to the `getInstallationProgress` method. Since they have access control levels of `NONE`, it suggests that interacting with the `IGsiService` interface does not require specific access control restrictions.

Additionally, the `getInstallationProgress` method is a getter method, which typically has a lower security risk compared to setter methods. As mentioned in the problem statement, if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the `getInstallationProgress` method does not require any specific access control restrictions, similar to the provided similar APIs.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
