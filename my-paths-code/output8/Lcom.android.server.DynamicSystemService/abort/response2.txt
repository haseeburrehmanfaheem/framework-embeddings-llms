Based on the provided information, we can analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `abort` method.

All the similar APIs (`finishInstallation`, `startInstallation`, `getInstallationProgress`, `isEnabled`, and `submitFromAshmem`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that these methods do not require any specific access control or permissions to be executed.

The `abort` method is related to canceling a GSI (Generic System Image) installation, which is a sensitive operation. However, considering the similarities with other APIs and their access control levels, it can be inferred that the `abort` method does not require a high level of access control.

Given the information provided, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `abort` method, as it is consistent with the access control levels of similar APIs.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that all similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, and there is no indication that the `abort` method requires additional access control or permissions. However, it's essential to note that this decision might need to be revisited if more information about the specific requirements or constraints of the `abort` method becomes available.
