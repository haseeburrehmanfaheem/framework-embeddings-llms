To determine the access control level for the `isInstalled` method in the `Lcom.android.server.DynamicSystemService` class, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with similar APIs.

The `isInstalled` method checks if an image is installed by reading a system property (`"gsid.image_installed"`). This operation does not modify any data but only retrieves information about the current state of the system. 

Given that the similar API, `isInUse()`, which also reads a system property (`"ro.gsid.image_running"`), has an access control level of `NONE`, we can infer that reading such properties for informational purposes is considered safe and does not pose significant security risks.

Following the principle that reading data (getter methods) generally requires less stringent access control than modifying data (setter methods), and considering the similarity in functionality between `isInstalled` and `isInUse`, it's reasonable to conclude that `isInstalled` should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the comparison with the `isInUse` API, the access control level for the `isInstalled` method should be `NONE`.

{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
