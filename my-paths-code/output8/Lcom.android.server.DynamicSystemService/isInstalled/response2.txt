To determine the access control level for the `isInstalled` method, we need to analyze its functionality, the sink it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `isInstalled` method checks if an image is installed by reading a system property `"gsid.image_installed"`. The similar API, `isInUse()Z`, checks if an image is in use by reading another system property `"ro.gsid.image_running"`. Both methods interact with system properties and return boolean values indicating the state of an image.

Given that `isInUse()Z` has an access control level of `NONE`, we can infer that reading system properties related to image states does not require significant access control. This is because system properties are generally used for configuration and informational purposes, and accessing them typically does not pose a security risk.

Considering the semantics and functionality of `isInstalled` in relation to `isInUse()Z` and the nature of system properties, it's reasonable to conclude that `isInstalled` should have a similar access control level. Since both methods essentially perform read operations on system properties without altering system states or accessing sensitive data, they do not require elevated permissions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparison with the similar API, the final access control level for the `isInstalled` method is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
