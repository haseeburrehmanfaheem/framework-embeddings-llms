To determine the access control level for the `submitFromAshmem` method, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs are:

1. `setAshmem(Landroid/os/ParcelFileDescriptor;J)Z`
2. `startInstallation(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`
3. `abort()Z`
4. `isEnabled()Z`
5. `closePartition()Z`

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the operations related to GSI (Generic System Image) service, such as setting ashmem, starting installation, aborting, checking if enabled, and closing partition, do not require specific access control restrictions in this context.

The `submitFromAshmem` method interacts with the GSI service by committing a chunk from ashmem, which is similar to the operations performed by the other APIs. Given that all similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it's reasonable to conclude that `submitFromAshmem` should also have the same access control level.

Therefore, based on the similarities and the nature of the operation, the access control level for the `submitFromAshmem` method should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is informed by the fact that all similar APIs, which interact with the GSI service in various ways, do not have restricted access control. It implies that the operations related to GSI service management are considered to be at a level of risk or sensitivity that does not require additional access controls beyond what is normally applied.
