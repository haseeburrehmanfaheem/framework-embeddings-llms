Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `remove` method in the `DynamicSystemService` class.

The `remove` method interacts with the `IGsiService` interface, which is also used by the similar APIs. The similar APIs have access control levels of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions.

The `remove` method itself does not seem to perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions. It appears to be a part of the Dynamic System service, which is responsible for managing the GSI (Generic System Image) service.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the lack of sensitive operations, I conclude that the `remove` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
