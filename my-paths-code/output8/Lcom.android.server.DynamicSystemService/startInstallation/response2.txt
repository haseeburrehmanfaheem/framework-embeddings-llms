Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control levels of similar APIs and their sink code entries to determine the appropriate access control level for the `startInstallation` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to function. However, it's essential to consider the semantics of each API and the potential security implications of their functionality.

Upon reviewing the sink code entries for each similar API, we can observe that they primarily interact with the `IGsiService` interface, which is related to GSI (Generic System Image) installation and management. The `startInstallation` method also interacts with this interface, specifically calling the `openInstall` method.

Given the similarities in functionality and the lack of specific permissions or restrictions in the similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `startInstallation` method does not require a high level of access control. However, since this method is involved in installing GSI images, which can potentially modify system settings or data, some level of protection is still necessary.

Considering these factors, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `startInstallation` method. This level provides a moderate degree of protection, ensuring that the method is not accessible to unauthorized parties while still allowing legitimate usage.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
