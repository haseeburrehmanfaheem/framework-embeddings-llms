To determine the access control level for the `isInUse` method in the `DynamicSystemService` class, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Method Semantics**: The `isInUse` method checks if a specific system property ("ro.gsid.image_running") is set to true, indicating whether an image is running or not. This operation involves reading a system property.

2. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The similar API provided is `isInstalled()`, which also reads a system property ("gsid.image_installed") to determine if an image is installed.
   - The access control level for `isInstalled()` is NONE, indicating that it does not require any specific permissions or restrictions to be accessed.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Reading data (as in the case of getting a system property) is generally considered less sensitive than writing data. Therefore, if a method only reads data without modifying it, it typically requires less stringent access control.
   - Given that `isInstalled()` has an access control level of NONE and it performs a similar operation (reading a system property), it suggests that reading such system properties for informational purposes does not pose significant security risks.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the method's semantics, its similarity to `isInstalled()`, and the principles guiding access control in Android, the `isInUse` method should have an access control level that reflects its low-risk nature of simply reading a system property without modifying any data or posing significant security risks.

Therefore, considering all these factors, the final access control level for the `isInUse` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision aligns with the treatment of similar APIs and the general principles of access control in Android, where reading operations are typically less restricted than writing operations.
