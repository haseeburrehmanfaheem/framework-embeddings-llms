To determine the access control level for the `isInUse` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `isInUse` method checks a system property `"ro.gsid.image_running"` and returns its boolean value. This operation does not seem to pose any significant risk or require special permissions since it's just reading a system property.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code is essentially the same as the method's body, reinforcing that this method's primary action is to read and return a system property's value.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `isInstalled()` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method also reads a system property (`"gsid.image_installed"`) and returns its boolean value, which is very similar in nature to the `isInUse` method.
   - The similarity score between `isInUse` and `isInstalled()` is high (0.9161214828491211), indicating that their functionalities are closely related.

Given these points:

- Both methods read system properties without modifying them or performing any actions that could be considered dangerous or requiring special permissions.
- The similar API has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that such operations are not restricted.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the nature of the operation (reading a system property), it's reasonable to conclude that the `isInUse` method should have the same access control level as the `isInstalled()` method.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
