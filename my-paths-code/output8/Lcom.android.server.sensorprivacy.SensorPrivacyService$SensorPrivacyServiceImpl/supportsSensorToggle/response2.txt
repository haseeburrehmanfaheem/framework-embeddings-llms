To determine the access control level for the `supportsSensorToggle` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The `supportsSensorToggle` method has similarities with the following APIs:

1. `requiresAuthentication()` with a similarity score of 0.9940281510353088 and 0.9876455664634705, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled(II)` with a similarity score of 0.7648593187332153, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled(I)` with a similarity score of 0.7398508787155151, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The `supportsSensorToggle` method is reading data from the resources, which is generally less sensitive than modifying it. However, considering its similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that this method might be dealing with sensitive information related to sensor privacy.

Given the similarities and the context in which this method operates (sensor privacy), it's reasonable to assign a similar access control level to ensure consistency and security across related functionalities.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the principle that if a getter method is protected (in this case, dealing with potentially sensitive sensor privacy settings), the corresponding functionality should be secured with an equal or higher access control level to maintain system integrity and user privacy.
