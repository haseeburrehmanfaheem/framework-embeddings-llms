To determine the access control level for the `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `addSensorPrivacyListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `removeSensorPrivacyListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `showSensorUseDialog`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `setSensorPrivacy`: NORMAL

2. **Semantics of the APIs**:
   - The `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method is used to register a listener for sensor privacy toggle events. This implies that it's dealing with sensitive information related to sensor privacy, which could impact user data and device security.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code entries for `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` involve registering listeners, adding death recipients, and handling listener additions. These operations are critical in managing how applications interact with sensor privacy features, suggesting a need for restricted access to prevent unauthorized or malicious activities.

4. **Access Control Principles**:
   - In Android, if a setter method (like `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener`) requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.
   - However, given that this method deals with adding listeners for sensitive events (sensor privacy toggles), it's reasonable to infer that controlling who can add these listeners is crucial for security and privacy.

Given these considerations:

- The similar APIs (`addSensorPrivacyListener`, `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener`, `removeSensorPrivacyListener`, `showSensorUseDialog`) all have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions. This suggests that operations related to sensor privacy listeners are considered sensitive and should be restricted.
- The method `setSensorPrivacy` has a NORMAL access control level, but it's an outlier in this context since it directly sets the state of sensor privacy rather than managing listeners.

Considering the sensitivity of managing sensor privacy listeners and the need to restrict access to such operations to prevent potential security risks or privacy violations, it's reasonable to conclude that `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` should have a similar access control level to its counterparts that manage sensor privacy listener registrations and removals.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs, the semantics of the method, and Android's access control principles:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the need for system or signature-level permissions to add a toggle sensor privacy listener, aligning with the security and privacy considerations evident in the similar APIs provided.
