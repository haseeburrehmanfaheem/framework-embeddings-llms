To determine the access control level for the `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method has three different code paths (depths), but all of them involve removing a listener from a list or handler. The key operations in these paths are:

1. Unregistering a listener (`this.mListeners.unregister(p1)`) in paths 1 and 2.
2. Removing a death recipient (`SensorPrivacyService$SensorPrivacyHandler.removeDeathRecipient(p1)`) in path 2, which is similar to the operation in one of the similar APIs.
3. Directly removing a listener from a handler (`this.mHandler.removeListener(p1)`) in path 3.

The sink code snippets provided also highlight these operations, focusing on unregistering listeners and managing death recipients.

Given the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided APIs:

- `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` has a high similarity score (0.9739920496940613) and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves unregistering a listener and removing a death recipient, similar to some paths in `removeSensorPrivacyListener`.
- `addSensorPrivacyListener` also has a high similarity score (0.9587239623069763) and the same access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`). It involves registering a listener and adding a death recipient, which is the opposite operation but within the same context of managing listeners.

Considering these similarities and operations, it appears that managing sensor privacy listeners (adding or removing them) requires a certain level of system or signature permission to ensure that only authorized components can modify these settings. This is consistent with the access control levels assigned to the similar APIs (`SYS_OR_SIG`).

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code paths, sink code, and comparison with similar APIs, the `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
