Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method.

The `removeSensorPrivacyListener` method is used to remove a sensor privacy listener from the system. This operation seems to be related to the management of sensitive data, as it involves the removal of a listener that may have access to private sensor information.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener`, `addSensorPrivacyListener`, and `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these operations are considered sensitive and require a high level of access control.
* `unregisterListener` has an access control level of `NORMAL`, but this method is related to network policy management, which may not be as sensitive as sensor privacy management.
* `removeCallback` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that removing callbacks can be a sensitive operation.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the fact that `removeSensorPrivacyListener` involves the removal of a listener that may have access to private sensor information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method. This is because removing a sensor privacy listener could potentially expose sensitive data or disrupt the normal functioning of the system, and therefore requires a high level of access control.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
