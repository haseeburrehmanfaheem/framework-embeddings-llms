To determine the access control level for the `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sinks, and similar APIs.

The provided code paths show that this method interacts with sensor privacy states, specifically checking if certain sensors are enabled or not. The method takes an integer parameter `p1`, which seems to be related to the type of sensor being checked (e.g., 1 or 2).

The sink code snippets indicate that the method's return value depends on the state of these sensors, and it may return 1 under certain conditions.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled(II)Z` with a similarity score of 0.9722566604614258:
   - This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Its code is quite similar to the paths shown for `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled`, as it also checks the state of sensors using `this.mSensorPrivacyStateController.getState`.

2. `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled(II)Z` with a similarity score of 0.9216219186782837:
   - This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code provided for this API is again similar, focusing on getting the sensor state and checking if it's enabled.

Given these observations:

- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they are considered system or signature protected. This suggests that their functionality, which is closely related to what `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` does (checking sensor privacy states), requires a certain level of protection or permission.
- The code paths for `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` show interactions with sensitive data (sensor states) in a manner similar to the provided APIs. This implies that it might require similar protections.

Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` should have an access control level consistent with its similar APIs, given their functional similarities and the nature of the data they interact with.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
