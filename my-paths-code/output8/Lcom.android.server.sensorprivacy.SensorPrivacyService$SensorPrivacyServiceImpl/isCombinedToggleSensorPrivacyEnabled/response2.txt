Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` method.

The method is a getter, which generally requires less restriction than a setter. However, considering the similarities with other APIs that interact with sensor privacy settings, it's essential to ensure that the access control level is sufficient to protect sensitive data.

Similar APIs, such as `isToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled`, `setToggleSensorPrivacy`, `isSensorPrivacyEnabled`, and `showSensorUseDialog`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are related to sensor privacy settings and require a system or signature-level permission to access or modify the settings.

Although the `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` method is a getter, its similarity to these APIs suggests that it should have a similar access control level. Additionally, the method's purpose is to check the combined toggle sensor privacy enabled state, which might be sensitive information.

Considering these factors, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `isCombinedToggleSensorPrivacyEnabled` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level components can access the combined toggle sensor privacy enabled state, protecting sensitive data and maintaining the security of the sensor privacy settings.
