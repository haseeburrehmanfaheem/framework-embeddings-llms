Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. The `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method is similar to these APIs in terms of its functionality and sink code entries.

Specifically, the `removeSensorPrivacyListener` API has a similarity of 0.9739918112754822 with the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method, and it also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method should also have a similar access control level.

Additionally, the `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener` API has a similarity of 0.9567385315895081 with the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method, and it also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the assignment of a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level to the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method.

Therefore, based on the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method.
