To determine the access control level for the `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) that involve unregistering or removing a listener (`ISensorPrivacyListener`) from various lists or handlers. This includes interactions with `mToggleSensorListeners`, `mDeathRecipients`, and `mHandler`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink codes provided show operations related to unregistering listeners and removing death recipients, which are critical for managing sensor privacy listeners.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **removeSensorPrivacyListener**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9739920496940613) with the method in question and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves unregistering a listener and removing a death recipient, similar to some paths of `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener`.
   - **addToggleSensorPrivacyListener**: Although this API is for adding a listener (opposite operation), it also has a high similarity score (0.9567386507987976) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves registering a listener and adding a death recipient.

Given the similarities in operations (unregistering/removing listeners and managing death recipients) between `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` and the similar APIs (`removeSensorPrivacyListener` and `addToggleSensorPrivacyListener`), and considering that both similar APIs are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` should also be treated with a similar level of access control. This is because all these methods deal with sensitive operations related to sensor privacy, which likely require system or signature-level permissions to protect user privacy and prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs that interact with the same sinks (listener management and death recipients), the final access control level for `removeToggleSensorPrivacyListener` should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the need to protect sensor privacy listener management operations from unauthorized access, ensuring that only system-level or signed applications can perform such sensitive tasks.
