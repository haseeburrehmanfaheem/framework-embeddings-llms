To analyze this API and identify potential sinks according to the provided rules, let's break down the code step by step.

The given method is `onReceive`, which takes a `Context` object (`p1`) and an `Intent` object (`p2`) as parameters. Here's how it flows:

1. An instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` (an inner class) is created with the current object (`p0`), `p2`, and `p1`. This creation has a naming similarity to the API name (`onReceive`) in terms of being part of the same class, but more importantly, it uses data from the API parameters (`p2` and `p1`).

2. The `start()` method is invoked on this newly created instance.

Given these steps, let's identify potential sinks based on the rules:

- **Method invocation**: The creation of a new object (`ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`) and its `start()` method invocation are both relevant because they directly use or manipulate data from the API parameters.
  
- **Object creation**: The new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created with data flow from the API parameters, making it a potential sink.

The instructions that contribute to this sink set are:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
      "v1.start();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This JSON represents the coherent set of instructions that form a potential sink, with a clear dataflow link between them. The creation and start of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` are directly influenced by the input parameters (`p1`, `p2`) of the `onReceive` method, thus forming a single sink array.
