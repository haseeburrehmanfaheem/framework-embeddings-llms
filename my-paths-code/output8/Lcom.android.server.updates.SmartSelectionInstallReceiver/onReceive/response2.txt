To assign an access control level to the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs. 

The provided code snippet for `onReceive` shows that it creates a new instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing in parameters `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`, and then starts this instance. The sink code reinforces this by highlighting the creation and starting of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`.

The similar APIs provided, with similarity scores of 1.0 and 0.9965633153915405, both have an access control level of `NONE`. Their code snippets are nearly identical to the one provided for `onReceive`, involving the creation and starting of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` with similar parameters.

Given this information:
- The method's functionality is consistent across the examples provided.
- There's no indication that it accesses sensitive data or performs dangerous operations that would require higher access control levels like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The similarity in code and access control level among the provided APIs suggests a pattern where such operations are considered to have minimal risk.

Therefore, based on the consistency of the code snippets and the access control levels of similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `onReceive` method is `NONE`.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
