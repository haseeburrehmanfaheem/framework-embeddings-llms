To determine the access control level for the `isLskfCaptured` method in the `RecoverySystemService` class, we should consider the similarities and differences between this method and the provided similar APIs, as well as the general principles of access control in Android.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs (`clearLskf`, `rebootWithLskfAssumeSlotSwitch`, `rebootWithLskf`, and `isAutoRevokeExempted`) all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that they are considered sensitive operations, likely because they involve system-level changes or access to potentially sensitive information.
   - These methods seem to be related to recovery system services, permission management, and rebooting with specific parameters, which are critical system functions.

2. **Method Semantics**:
   - The `isLskfCaptured` method checks if a given string (`p1`) is contained within the `mCallerPreparedForReboot` collection. This operation does not modify any data but rather queries the state of the system.
   - Given that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, one might initially consider a lower access control level for a getter method compared to its corresponding setter.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - If a setter method requires a high level of access control (like `SYS_OR_SIG`), the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading is less sensitive than writing.
   - However, considering the context of system services and recovery operations, even querying certain states might require elevated permissions to protect the integrity and security of the system.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite the `isLskfCaptured` method being a getter and thus potentially less sensitive, its context within system recovery services suggests that it still deals with sensitive system state.
   - Given the similarities with other methods that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level and considering the importance of protecting system integrity, it's reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `isLskfCaptured`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the principles of access control in Android, the final access control level for the `isLskfCaptured` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects the method's involvement in system-critical operations and the need to maintain system security and integrity.
