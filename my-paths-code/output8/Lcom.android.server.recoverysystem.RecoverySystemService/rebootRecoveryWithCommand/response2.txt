Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` API.

The `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` API has similarities with other APIs in the same class, such as `setupBcb`, `clearBcb`, `uncrypt`, `rebootWithLskfAssumeSlotSwitch`, and `rebootWithLskf`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The sink code entries for the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` API also involve interactions with system properties, socket connections, and power management, which are similar to the sink code entries of the other APIs.

Given the similarities in code and functionality, as well as the access control levels of the similar APIs, I conclude that the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` API should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the API requires system or signature-level permission to execute, which is consistent with the access control levels of the similar APIs.
