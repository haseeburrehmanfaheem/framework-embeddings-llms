To determine the access control level for the `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, involving system properties, service connections, and rebooting the device. The sink code includes operations like connecting to services, sending commands, and rebooting.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `setupBcb(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` with a similarity score of 0.9608771204948425 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API involves connecting to a service and sending commands.
   - Another instance of `setupBcb(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` with a slightly lower similarity score of 0.9169588685035706, also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, involving similar operations.

Given the information:

- The `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` method interacts with system-level services and performs actions that require significant privileges (e.g., rebooting the device, connecting to specific services).
- The similar APIs (`setupBcb`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are system-oriented or signature-protected, which aligns with the nature of operations performed by `rebootRecoveryWithCommand`.

Considering these points, the method's ability to reboot the device and interact with sensitive services suggests it should be protected at a level that prevents unauthorized access. Thus, the appropriate access control level for `rebootRecoveryWithCommand` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it involves system-critical operations similar to those of the provided similar APIs.
