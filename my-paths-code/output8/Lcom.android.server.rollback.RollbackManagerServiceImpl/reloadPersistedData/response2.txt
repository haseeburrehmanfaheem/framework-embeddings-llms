To determine the access control level for the `reloadPersistedData` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths create an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0` and use it in conjunction with either `CompletableFuture.runAsync` or `awaitResult`. This indicates asynchronous or concurrent execution, which is a common pattern but does not directly imply a specific access control level without considering the context and similar APIs.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The two provided similar APIs (`expireRollbackForPackage` and `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to rollback management are considered sensitive or system-internal, requiring either system or signature-level permissions.

3. **Comparison and Decision**:
   - Given the high similarity scores with these APIs (0.9788458347320557 and 0.970863938331604), it's reasonable to infer that `reloadPersistedData` is also involved in sensitive operations related to rollback management.
   - The use of asynchronous execution and interaction with what appears to be internal or system-level components (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl`, `CompletableFuture`) further supports the notion that this method should have a restricted access control level.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Considering the similarities in functionality, code structure, and the sensitive nature of rollback management operations, it's logical to conclude that `reloadPersistedData` should have an access control level similar to its counterparts.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate access control level for `reloadPersistedData`, based on the provided information and analysis, is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
