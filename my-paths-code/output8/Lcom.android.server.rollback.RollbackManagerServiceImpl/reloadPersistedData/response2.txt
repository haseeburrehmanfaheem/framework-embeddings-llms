Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `reloadPersistedData` method in the `RollbackManagerServiceImpl` class.

The method has three different code paths with similarities to other APIs in the same class. The similar APIs have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

The `reloadPersistedData` method is used to reload persisted data, which is a sensitive operation that may involve accessing and modifying internal state. Given the similarities with other APIs in the same class that have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is likely that the `reloadPersistedData` method also requires a similar level of protection.

Additionally, the method uses `CompletableFuture` and `Executor` to perform asynchronous operations, which may involve interacting with system-level components or sensitive data. This further supports the need for a higher access control level.

Considering these factors, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `reloadPersistedData` method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
