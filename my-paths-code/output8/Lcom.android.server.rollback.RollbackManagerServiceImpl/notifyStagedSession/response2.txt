Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `notifyStagedSession` method.

The reason for this decision is as follows:

* The `notifyStagedSession` method has a high similarity with other methods in the same class (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl`) that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, such as `expireRollbackForPackage`, `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`, `getAvailableRollbacks`, and `reloadPersistedData`. This suggests that the `notifyStagedSession` method is likely to be performing a similar operation that requires a high level of access control.
* The `notifyStagedSession` method is using `CompletableFuture` and `supplyAsync` methods, which are similar to the methods used in the other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This suggests that the method is performing an asynchronous operation that requires a high level of access control.
* The `notifyStagedSession` method is also using a lambda expression (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda9`) which is similar to the lambda expressions used in the other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Overall, based on the similarities between the APIs and the operations being performed, I believe that the `notifyStagedSession` method requires an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
