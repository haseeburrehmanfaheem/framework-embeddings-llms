Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method.

The method is a getter, which generally requires less restriction than a setter. However, considering the similarities with other APIs in the same class (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl`) that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's likely that this method also requires a similar level of protection.

All the similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they are sensitive and require system or signature-level permission to access. The similarities in code structure and functionality between these APIs and the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method support this conclusion.

Therefore, I assign the following access control level to the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarities with other APIs in the same class and the potential sensitivity of the data being accessed. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level ensures that only system or signature-level permissions can access this method, providing a reasonable level of protection for the underlying data.
