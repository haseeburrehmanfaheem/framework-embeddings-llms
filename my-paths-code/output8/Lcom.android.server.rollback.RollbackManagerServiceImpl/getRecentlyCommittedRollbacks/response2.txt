To determine the access control level for the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0), all of which involve creating a `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8` instance and using it with either `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` or `awaitResult`. These operations suggest asynchronous execution and interaction with rollback management services.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided are essentially the same as parts of the method's implementation, focusing on the creation of a lambda instance and its use in asynchronous operations. This indicates that the critical aspect of this method is how it interacts with these asynchronous tasks and the rollback service.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs (`getAvailableRollbacks`) are provided, both with high similarity scores (0.9963403940200806 and 0.9951362013816833). 
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Their code snippets show a pattern similar to the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method, involving lambda instances and asynchronous execution or awaiting results.

Given this information:

- The `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method involves managing rollbacks, which is a sensitive operation that could potentially impact system stability or security if not properly controlled.
- The use of `enforceManageRollbacks` in some paths explicitly indicates that this method requires specific permissions to manage rollbacks.
- The similarity with other APIs (`getAvailableRollbacks`) that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests a pattern. These similar APIs also deal with rollback management and have high similarity scores, indicating their operations are closely related.
- `SYS_OR_SIG` access control typically implies that the method can be invoked by system or signature applications, which aligns with the sensitive nature of managing rollbacks.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method should have a similar access control level to its highly similar counterparts, given its involvement in rollback management and the need for controlled access to such functionality.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
