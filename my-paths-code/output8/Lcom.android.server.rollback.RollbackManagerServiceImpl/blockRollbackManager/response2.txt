To determine the access control level for the `blockRollbackManager` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `blockRollbackManager` method uses a `Handler` to post a `Runnable` (specifically, an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda13`). This pattern is common in Android for performing actions on a specific thread or at a later time.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` API has a high similarity score and is assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Its code snippet shows a similar pattern of posting a lambda to a handler.
   - The `expireRollbackForPackage` API also has a high similarity score with `blockRollbackManager` and is assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Although it uses `awaitResult` instead of posting to a handler, the underlying interaction with rollback management services suggests a similar security context.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically used for APIs that do not pose any security risk.
   - `NORMAL`: Used for APIs that require standard permissions but are generally safe.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Assigned to APIs that can potentially cause harm if misused, requiring explicit user consent or special permissions.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-internal or signature-protected APIs. These are typically used by the system itself or by apps signed with the same certificate as the system, indicating a high level of trust and access to sensitive operations.

Given that both similar APIs (`snapshotAndRestoreUserData` and `expireRollbackForPackage`) have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their interaction with rollback management services (which likely involves system-level operations or sensitive data), it's reasonable to infer that `blockRollbackManager` should also be treated with a similar level of security consideration.

The operation of blocking a rollback manager suggests an action that could impact the state of the system or user data significantly, potentially requiring a high level of access control to prevent misuse. Therefore, considering the patterns and similarities with other APIs in the same domain, `blockRollbackManager` should likely be assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
