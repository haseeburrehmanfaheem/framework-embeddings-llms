Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `blockRollbackManager` method.

The similar APIs provided have a high similarity score (above 0.9) and are all assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs interact with the same class (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl`) and have similar sink code entries, which suggests that they are related to rollback management and require a high level of access control.

The `blockRollbackManager` method has a similar structure and purpose to these APIs, as it blocks the rollback manager for a specified duration. Given its similarity to these APIs and its potential impact on system stability and security, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `blockRollbackManager` method is protected with a high level of access control, consistent with similar APIs in the same class.
