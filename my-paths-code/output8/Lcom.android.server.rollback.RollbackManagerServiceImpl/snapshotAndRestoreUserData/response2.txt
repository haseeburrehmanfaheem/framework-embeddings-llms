Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a high level of access control due to their sensitive nature. These APIs are related to rollback management, data persistence, and package management, which are critical components of the Android system.

The `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method appears to be related to snapshotting and restoring user data, which is a sensitive operation that requires careful handling. Given its similarity to the other APIs, it is likely that this method also requires a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to user data.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
