To determine the access control level for the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets show two paths (path 1 with depth 1 and path 2 with depth 0) that both lead to creating an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda14` and posting it to a handler. The key sink code involves posting this lambda to the handler, which suggests interaction with system-level or sensitive operations.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. **blockRollbackManager(J)V** - With a similarity score of 0.9773675799369812 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This API also involves creating a lambda (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda13`) and posting it to a handler, similar to the sink code in `snapshotAndRestoreUserData`.

2. **expireRollbackForPackage(Ljava/lang/String;)V** - With a similarity score of 0.952835202217102 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Although this API awaits a result from a lambda (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7`) instead of posting to a handler, it still interacts with rollback management services in a way that requires system or signature-level access control.

Given the high similarity scores and the nature of operations (involving rollback management services and interacting with handlers), it's reasonable to infer that `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` also deals with sensitive system operations. The fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG suggests that `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` should also require a similar level of access control due to its interactions with system-level components.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `snapshotAndRestoreUserData` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
