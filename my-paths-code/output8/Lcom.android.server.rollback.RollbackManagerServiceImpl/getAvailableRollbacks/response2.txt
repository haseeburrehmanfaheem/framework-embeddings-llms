To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableRollbacks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) that all eventually lead to executing a lambda function (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12`) either synchronously or asynchronously. The key aspects here are the checks and enforcements:
   - `Preconditions.checkState((v4 ^ 1))` and similar checks ensure that certain conditions are met before proceeding.
   - `p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getAvailableRollbacks")` explicitly enforces a manage rollbacks permission check.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets all involve creating an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12` and executing it to get a result, which is then returned. This execution can happen synchronously or asynchronously but always involves checking states or permissions before proceeding.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 
   - Their code snippets also involve creating lambda instances and executing them, with a focus on permission checks and state verifications.
   - The high similarity scores (0.9963403940200806 and 0.9951362013816833) indicate that these APIs are very similar in functionality and likely require similar access control levels.

Given this analysis:

- **Permission Checks**: The presence of explicit permission checks like `p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getAvailableRollbacks")` suggests that the method is accessing sensitive functionality that requires specific permissions.
- **Similarity with Other APIs**: The high similarity scores with other APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` imply that `getAvailableRollbacks` likely requires a similar level of access control.
- **Sensitive Operations**: The method's involvement in managing rollbacks, which can impact system stability and security, further supports the need for a restrictive access control level.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for the `getAvailableRollbacks` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it reflects the need for system or signature-level permissions to manage sensitive operations like rollbacks.
