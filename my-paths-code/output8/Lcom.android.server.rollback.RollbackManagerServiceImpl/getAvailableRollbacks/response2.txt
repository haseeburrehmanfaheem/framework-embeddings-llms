Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will analyze the access control level for the `getAvailableRollbacks` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to rollback management, and their similarities in code structure and functionality suggest that they share similar security requirements.

The `getAvailableRollbacks` method is a getter method that retrieves available rollbacks, which is a read-only operation. According to the Android access control guidelines, if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction, since reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.

However, considering the similarities with other APIs in the `RollbackManagerServiceImpl` class, which all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and the fact that this method is still part of the rollback management functionality, I would argue that it should have a similar access control level to maintain consistency and security within the system.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `getAvailableRollbacks` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the method is protected with a suitable access control level, considering its functionality and similarities with other APIs in the same class.
