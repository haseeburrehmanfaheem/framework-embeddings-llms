To determine the access control level for the `expireRollbackForPackage` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0) that all involve creating a `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7` instance and then executing it asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.runAsync` or directly awaiting the result.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink codes provided are essentially variations of how the lambda expression is executed (either through `runAsync` followed by `get()` to wait for the result, or directly through `awaitResult`).

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs (`notifyStagedSession(I)I`) have a high similarity score (> 0.98), indicating their code structure and possibly functionality are very close to `expireRollbackForPackage`.
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Given the similarities in code structure, execution pattern (asynchronous with a wait for result), and the high similarity scores with other APIs that are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that `expireRollbackForPackage` likely requires similar access control. The method's interaction with system-level components (like `Looper`, `Handler`, and asynchronous execution) further supports this inference, as such operations often require elevated permissions to ensure system stability and security.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `expireRollbackForPackage` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This classification reflects the method's need for system or signature-level permissions to safely execute its functionality without compromising the system's integrity.
