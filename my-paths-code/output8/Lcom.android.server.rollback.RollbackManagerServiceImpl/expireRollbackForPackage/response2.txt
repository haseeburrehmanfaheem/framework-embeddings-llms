Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `expireRollbackForPackage` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to rollback management and seem to be performing critical operations.

The `expireRollbackForPackage` method is also part of the rollback management functionality, and its code snippets show similarities with the provided similar APIs. The method is expiring a rollback for a package, which could potentially have security implications if not properly restricted.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the potential security risks associated with modifying rollback data, I will assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `expireRollbackForPackage` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the method is properly restricted to system or signature-level permission, aligning with the security requirements of similar APIs in the rollback management functionality.
