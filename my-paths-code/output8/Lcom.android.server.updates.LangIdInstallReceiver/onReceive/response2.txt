To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippet for `onReceive` is:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
And the sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0, p2, p1);
v1.start();
```
The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE` and their code snippets are almost identical to the one provided for `onReceive`. The similarity scores are very high (1.0 and 0.9965633153915405), indicating that these APIs are nearly identical in terms of functionality.

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should have a similar access control level as its highly similar counterparts.

The final access control level for the API is:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
This decision is based on the high similarity between the provided code snippet and the code snippets of the similar APIs, which all have an access control level of `NONE`.
