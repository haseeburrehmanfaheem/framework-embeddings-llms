To determine the access control level for the `getWatchlistConfigHash` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `reloadWatchlist()` in `NetworkWatchlistService`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `getSplitPermissions()` in `PermissionManagerService`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `retrieveSystemUpdateInfo()` in `SystemUpdateManagerService`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `getRestrictBackgroundStatus()` in `NetworkPolicyManagerService`: NORMAL

2. **Semantics of the APIs**:
   - The `getWatchlistConfigHash` method is involved in reading and processing watchlist configurations, which seems to be related to network security or policy management.
   - The method interacts with file systems (reading from a file) and performs hash operations, indicating it deals with data integrity or validation.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - If a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.
   - However, if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level.

Given these points:

- The `getWatchlistConfigHash` method primarily reads data (from a file) and computes a hash. This operation does not modify system settings or sensitive data but rather retrieves information that could be used for validation or integrity checks.
- The similar APIs provided have varying levels of access control, with most being SYS_OR_SIG, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions, possibly due to their involvement in system management or security-related operations.
- Considering the principle that reading data is less sensitive than writing, and given that `getWatchlistConfigHash` is a getter method without a corresponding setter method shown in the provided context, it might not require as high a level of access control as methods that modify system settings.

However, since this method deals with watchlist configurations which could be security-related, assigning it a level of NORMAL seems reasonable. This is because it's involved in reading and processing potentially sensitive information (watchlist configs), but it does so in a read-only manner without modifying the system state directly.

Therefore, considering the balance between security and the nature of the operation (reading/config validation vs. modification of settings), the access control level for `getWatchlistConfigHash` should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision reflects the method's role in potentially sensitive data processing without direct system state modification, aligning with the principle that reading is less risky than writing but still may require some level of control.
