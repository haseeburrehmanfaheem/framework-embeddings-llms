To determine the access control level for the `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`: NORMAL
   - `setVcnConfig`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `clearVcnConfig`: NONE
   - `grantDefaultPermissionsToEnabledImsServices` and `revokeDefaultPermissionsFromLuiApps`: Both are SYS_OR_SIG, but these are less similar in terms of functionality to the method in question.

2. **Functionality and Sensitivity**:
   - The method `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` is involved in managing network policy listeners, which could potentially impact system security or privacy if not properly restricted.
   - Given that it's a "remove" operation, it might be considered less sensitive than a "set" operation but more sensitive than simply reading data.

3. **Code Similarity and Sinks**:
   - The code snippets for the similar APIs show the use of `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`, which is a mechanism to perform operations with the calling identity cleaned, typically used to prevent leaks of sensitive information about the caller.
   - This pattern suggests that these methods are dealing with potentially sensitive operations or data.

Considering these points:

- The method is related to network policy management, which can be considered sensitive.
- It's removing a listener, which could have implications for system security or functionality if not properly controlled.
- The most similar API in terms of functionality (`addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`) has a NORMAL access control level.
- Other APIs with higher similarity in code but different functionalities have varying access control levels, with `setVcnConfig` being SYS_OR_SIG and `clearVcnConfig` being NONE.

Given the above analysis, and considering that removing a listener might not be as sensitive as setting a configuration (like in `setVcnConfig`) but could still impact system behavior or security, the most appropriate access control level seems to be NORMAL. This is because it's less restrictive than SYS_OR_SIG, which is typically required for operations that directly affect system security or require significant privileges, but more controlled than NONE, acknowledging the potential impact of removing a network policy listener.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice balances the need to restrict access to potentially sensitive operations with the understanding that this specific method might not require the highest level of restriction compared to other system configuration settings.
