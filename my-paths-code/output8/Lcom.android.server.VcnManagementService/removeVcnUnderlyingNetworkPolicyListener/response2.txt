To determine the access control level for the `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the method itself.

1. **Similarity with `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`**: This API has a very high similarity score (0.9948990941047668) with the method in question. The access control level for `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` is NORMAL. Given the high similarity, it suggests that `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` might also require a similar level of access control, as both methods seem to interact with listeners in a comparable manner.

2. **Similarity with `setVcnConfig`**: Although this API has a slightly lower similarity score (0.9908081293106079) compared to `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, it's still quite high. The access control level for `setVcnConfig` is SYS_OR_SIG, which indicates a higher level of restriction, typically requiring system or signature-level permissions.

3. **Semantics and Code Analysis**: Both similar APIs use `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity` which is a mechanism to perform operations with the calling identity cleaned, typically used in system services to ensure that certain operations are performed without leaking the caller's identity. This pattern suggests that these methods are dealing with sensitive operations or data.

Considering the high similarity scores and the context provided by both similar APIs, we can infer the following:

- The method `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` is closely related to managing network policy listeners, which could involve system-level operations given the use of `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`.
- The similarity with `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` (NORMAL access control) suggests that it might not require the highest level of permission but still needs some form of access control.
- The slightly lower but still high similarity with `setVcnConfig` (SYS_OR_SIG access control) indicates that while system or signature-level permissions might be more stringent than necessary, there's an implication of dealing with potentially sensitive network configurations.

Given these considerations and the fact that removing a listener seems like an operation that should be controlled to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to network policies, but not necessarily requiring system-level permissions as setting a configuration might, the most appropriate access control level for `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` would likely align closer to NORMAL. This is because it involves managing listeners which is a controlled action but doesn't seem to directly modify system configurations like `setVcnConfig` does.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
