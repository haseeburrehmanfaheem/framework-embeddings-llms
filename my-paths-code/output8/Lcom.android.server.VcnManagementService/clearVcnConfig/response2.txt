Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `clearVcnConfig` method.

The `clearVcnConfig` method has a high similarity with `setVcnConfig`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Both methods interact with VCN (Virtual Carrier Network) configurations and perform operations that require system or signature-level permissions. The `clearVcnConfig` method also enforces primary user and carrier privilege checks, similar to `setVcnConfig`.

The other similar APIs, such as `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` and `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, have an access control level of `NORMAL`. However, these methods do not perform operations that require system or signature-level permissions, unlike `clearVcnConfig`.

Considering the similarities with `setVcnConfig` and the enforcement of primary user and carrier privilege checks, I conclude that the `clearVcnConfig` method requires a high level of access control.

The final access control level for the `clearVcnConfig` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that only system or signature-level privileged entities can clear VCN configurations, maintaining the security and integrity of the system.
