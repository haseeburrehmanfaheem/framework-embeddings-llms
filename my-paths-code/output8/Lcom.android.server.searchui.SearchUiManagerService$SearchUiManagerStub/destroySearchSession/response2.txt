To determine the access control level for the `destroySearchSession` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets for `destroySearchSession` show three different paths (depths 2, 1, and 0) that involve handling user identities, checking temporary status, and interacting with system services like `ActivityManagerInternal` and `SearchUiManagerService`. The API's primary action is to destroy a search session based on the provided `SearchSessionId`.

The similar APIs provided, specifically the `query` method, have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods also interact with system services and handle user identities but are primarily focused on querying search results.

Given that the `destroySearchSession` API is closely related in functionality to these similar APIs (as indicated by high similarity scores), and considering its interactions with system services and handling of user identities, we can infer that it does not require elevated permissions beyond what is typical for such operations within the system's search framework.

Therefore, based on the provided information and comparisons with similar APIs, the access control level for `destroySearchSession` should be consistent with those similar APIs, which have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This determination is made under the assumption that the API's functionality does not pose significant risks or require special system privileges beyond what is standard for managing search sessions within the Android framework.
