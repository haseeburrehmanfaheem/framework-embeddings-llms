Based on the provided code snippet, here's the analysis:

The method `startConsentActivity` invokes another method `onStartConsentActivity` on an object `mService`, passing the input parameters `p1` and `p2`. This invocation follows one of the positive rules: it takes the input parameters as arguments.

Here is the identified sink in JSON format:
```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "this.mService.onStartConsentActivity(p1, p2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```
Note that there's only one instruction contributing to this sink. The `return` statement does not contribute to the sink as it simply exits the method without any data flow or processing. The variable declarations and assignments for `p1` and `p2` are also not included in the sink, as they are merely input parameters being passed through to another method invocation.
