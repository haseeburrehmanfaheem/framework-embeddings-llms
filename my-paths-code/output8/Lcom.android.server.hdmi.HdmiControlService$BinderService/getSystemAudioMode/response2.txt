Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `getSystemAudioMode` API.

The `getSystemAudioMode` API is related to HDMI audio mode and seems to be checking if the system audio mode is activated or not. The similar APIs provided are also related to HDMI and media services.

The most similar API, `canChangeSystemAudioMode`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `getSystemAudioMode` API might require a similar level of access control, as it is also related to system audio mode.

Another similar API, `shouldHandleTvPowerKey`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API is related to TV power key handling and seems to be checking if the HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) is enabled or not.

On the other hand, APIs like `isPlaybackActive` and `isDeviceColorManaged` have an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any special permissions. However, these APIs seem to be less related to system audio mode and HDMI services compared to the other similar APIs.

Considering the similarities between the `getSystemAudioMode` API and the other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getSystemAudioMode` API. This is because the API seems to be related to system audio mode and HDMI services, which might require a higher level of access control.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the provided information and the similarities between the `getSystemAudioMode` API and other APIs with known access control levels. However, it's essential to note that this decision might need to be adjusted if more information becomes available or if there are any changes in the API's functionality or requirements.
