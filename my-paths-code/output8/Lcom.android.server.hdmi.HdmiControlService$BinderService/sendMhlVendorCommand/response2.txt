To determine the access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of `sendMhlVendorCommand` involve creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21` and then either posting it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler or running it on a service thread.
   - The key actions are related to sending MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) vendor commands, which implies interaction with external devices or services.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs provided (`startOneTouchRecord` and `reportAudioStatus`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These APIs also involve posting runnables to a handler, similar to the paths in `sendMhlVendorCommand`.
   - The similarity in code structure (creating a specific service class instance and then handling it through a runnable) suggests that these methods are likely performing system-level or signature-protected operations.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the similarities between `sendMhlVendorCommand` and the provided APIs (`startOneTouchRecord` and `reportAudioStatus`), both of which require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it is reasonable to conclude that `sendMhlVendorCommand` also requires a similar level of access control.
   - The operations involved (sending MHL vendor commands) are likely to be system-level or require specific permissions, aligning with the need for `SYS_OR_SIG` protection.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis of the code paths and the comparison with similar APIs, the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
