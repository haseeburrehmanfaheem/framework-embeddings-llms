Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method.

The method has three different paths with depths 0, 1, and 2, but all of them create an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21` and post it to a handler or run it on a service thread. The sink code entries for these paths are similar to the ones found in the provided similar APIs.

The similar APIs (`startOneTouchRecord`, `reportAudioStatus`, `setStandbyMode`, `clearTimerRecording`, and `sendVendorCommand`) all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also part of the `HdmiControlService$BinderService` class and interact with the HDMI service, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the HDMI functionality.

Given the similarities between the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method and the provided APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method also requires a system or signature-level permission to access the MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) vendor command functionality.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
