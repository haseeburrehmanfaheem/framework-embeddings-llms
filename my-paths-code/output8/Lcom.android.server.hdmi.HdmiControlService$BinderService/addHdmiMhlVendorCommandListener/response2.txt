Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` method.

The method is used to add a listener for HDMI MHL vendor commands, which suggests that it may have some security implications. The similar APIs provided, such as `addVendorCommandListener`, `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`, and `addDeviceEventListener`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also used to add listeners for various HDMI-related events, which suggests that they may require similar security restrictions.

The sink code entries provided for the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` method show that it creates a new `HdmiControlService$HdmiMhlVendorCommandListenerRecord` object and adds it to a list of listener records. This is similar to the behavior of the other APIs mentioned above.

Given this information, I would conclude that the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it may pose a security risk if not properly restricted.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity between the `addHdmiMhlVendorCommandListener` method and other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as well as the potential security implications of adding a listener for HDMI MHL vendor commands.
