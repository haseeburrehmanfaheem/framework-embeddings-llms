Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method.

The method is similar to other APIs in the same class, such as `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`, `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, `setInputChangeListener`, `addDeviceEventListener`, and `addHotplugEventListener`. All of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The sink code for `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` also shows similar patterns to the other APIs, such as creating a new record, linking to death, and adding to a list.

Given the similarities in code and functionality, it is reasonable to conclude that the `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method should have the same access control level as the other similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that all similar APIs in the same class have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and the code patterns are consistent across these methods.
