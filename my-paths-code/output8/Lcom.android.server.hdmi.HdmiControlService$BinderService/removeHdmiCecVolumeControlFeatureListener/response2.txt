To determine the access control level for the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them ultimately lead to either removing a listener from `mHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListenerRecords` or calling another method to remove a volume control status change listener.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves unregistering a listener (`this.mHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListenerRecords.unregister(p1);`) and removing a volume control status change listener (`this.this$0.removeHdmiControlVolumeControlStatusChangeListener(p1);`).

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`, with high similarity scores. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code for these similar APIs involves registering a listener and running a service thread, which implies interaction with system-level services or significant functionality.

Given this information:

- **Similarity to System or Signature Protected APIs**: The similar APIs (`addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are either system-level protected or require a specific signature to interact with. This suggests that the functionality related to HDMI CEC volume control features is considered sensitive or significant enough to warrant protection.

- **Nature of the Method**: The `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method is involved in managing listeners for volume control feature changes, which can be considered a part of system-level functionality given its relation to hardware (HDMI CEC) and potentially affecting how the device interacts with external systems or devices.

- **Access Control Levels**:
  - `NONE`: Implies no specific protection or access control.
  - `NORMAL`: General protection level that doesn't require special permissions beyond basic app operation.
  - `DANGEROUS`: Requires explicit user permission to access sensitive features.
  - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-level operations or those requiring a specific signature, often implying deeper system integration or sensitivity.

Considering the method's functionality and its similarity to APIs with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is reasonable to conclude that managing HDMI CEC volume control feature listeners also involves system-level or sensitive operations. Therefore, the appropriate access control level for `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` should align with the similar APIs provided.

**Final Access Control Level**:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination is based on the method's involvement in system-level functionality, its similarity to other protected APIs, and the implication that such operations are sensitive or significant enough to warrant a higher level of access control.
