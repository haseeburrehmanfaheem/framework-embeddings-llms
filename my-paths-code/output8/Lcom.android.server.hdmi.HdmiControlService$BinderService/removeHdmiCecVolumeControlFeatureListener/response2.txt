Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method.

The method is used to remove a listener for HDMI CEC volume control feature events. The similar APIs provided, such as `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`, `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`, `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, and `removeCecSettingChangeListener`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the removal of listeners for these events is considered a sensitive operation that requires system or signature-level permission.

The only API with a different access control level is `unregisterRemoteSessionCallback`, which has an access control level of `NONE`. However, this API is from a different class and package, and its similarity score is relatively low compared to the other APIs. Therefore, it can be considered an outlier and not directly relevant to the determination of the access control level for `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`.

Considering the similarities in code and functionality between `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` and the other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, I would conclude that `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
