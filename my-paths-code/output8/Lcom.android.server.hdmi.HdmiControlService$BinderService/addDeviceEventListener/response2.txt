Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addDeviceEventListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `addDeviceEventListener` method has three paths with different depths, but they all ultimately lead to the same sink code, which creates a new `HdmiControlService$DeviceEventListenerRecord` instance, links the listener's binder to death, and adds the record to a list.

The similar APIs, `addHotplugEventListener` and `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`, have high similarity scores (0.894 and 0.892, respectively) and are both assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also create records, link binders to death, and add them to lists, similar to the `addDeviceEventListener` method.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality between these APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `addDeviceEventListener` method should have a similar access control level. Since the similar APIs are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission, it is likely that the `addDeviceEventListener` method also requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and similar APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `addDeviceEventListener` method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
