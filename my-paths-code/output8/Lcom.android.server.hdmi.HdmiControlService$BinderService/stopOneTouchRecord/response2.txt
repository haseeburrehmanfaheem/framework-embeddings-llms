To determine the access control level for the `stopOneTouchRecord` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

All three paths of the `stopOneTouchRecord` method involve creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$18` and then either posting it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler or running it on a service thread. This pattern is consistent across all paths, indicating that the method's primary action involves executing a specific task related to HDMI control services.

The similar APIs provided, `setStandbyMode(Z)V` and `reportAudioStatus(IIIZ)V`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also follow a pattern where they create instances of different inner classes (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$22` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$23`, respectively) and post them as `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler. The similarity in code structure and the fact that these methods are related to HDMI control services suggest that they likely require similar access control levels due to their operational context within the system.

Given this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `stopOneTouchRecord` method should have an access control level consistent with the similar APIs provided, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This level indicates that the method can be accessed by system or signature-protected components, reflecting its integration with system-level services like HDMI control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `stopOneTouchRecord` API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
