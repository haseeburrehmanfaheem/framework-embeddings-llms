Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `stopOneTouchRecord` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `stopOneTouchRecord` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them create an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$18` and post it to a handler or run it on a service thread. The sink code entries for this method are similar to those of the provided similar APIs.

The similar APIs, such as `setStandbyMode`, `reportAudioStatus`, `clearTimerRecording`, `powerOnRemoteDevice`, and `startOneTouchRecord`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also create instances of different inner classes and post them to handlers or run them on service threads.

Given the similarities between the `stopOneTouchRecord` method and the provided similar APIs, it is likely that the `stopOneTouchRecord` method requires a similar access control level. Since all the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to the `stopOneTouchRecord` method.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `stopOneTouchRecord` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
