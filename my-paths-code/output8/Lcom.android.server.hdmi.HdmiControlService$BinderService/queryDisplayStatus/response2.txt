To determine the access control level for the `queryDisplayStatus` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `queryDisplayStatus` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): It creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7` and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): It initializes a binder call, creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7`, wraps it in a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, and posts it to the handler using `this.mHandler.post(v6)`.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): It initializes the binder call, creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7`, and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v2)`.

The sink code for these paths involves creating instances of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7` and running or posting them to the handler.

Now, let's compare this with the similar APIs:

* `powerOffRemoteDevice(II)V`: It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and creates a `HdmiControlService$BinderService$9` instance, wraps it in a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, and posts it to the handler.
* `setSystemAudioMode(ZLandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V`: It also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and creates a `HdmiControlService$BinderService$8` instance, wraps it in a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, and posts it to the handler.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and involve creating instances of inner classes (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$9` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$8`) and posting them to the handler. The `queryDisplayStatus` method exhibits similar behavior, creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7` and running or posting it to the handler.

Given these similarities, it's reasonable to conclude that the `queryDisplayStatus` method should have a similar access control level.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" \}}$
