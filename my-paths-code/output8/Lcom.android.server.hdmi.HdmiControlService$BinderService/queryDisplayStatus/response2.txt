Based on the provided information, we can see that the `queryDisplayStatus` method has a high similarity with other APIs in the same class, such as `powerOffRemoteDevice`, `setSystemAudioMode`, `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource`, `portSelect`, and `powerOnRemoteDevice`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The `queryDisplayStatus` method also interacts with the same sinks as these similar APIs, specifically the `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7` runnable and the `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` class.

Given this information, it is likely that the `queryDisplayStatus` method requires a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized access to the HDMI control service. Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `queryDisplayStatus` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
