Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getUserCecSettings` method.

The `getUserCecSettings` method is used to retrieve a list of user-configurable CEC settings. The method has three different paths with varying levels of complexity, but all of them ultimately return a list of settings.

The similar APIs provided, such as `getCecSettingStringValue`, `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues`, `getCecSettingIntValue`, and `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also related to retrieving CEC settings or values, which suggests that they require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the `shouldHandleTvPowerKey` method, which has a similarity score of 0.8375144004821777, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method is related to handling TV power key events, which may involve interacting with CEC settings.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getUserCecSettings` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getUserCecSettings` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getUserCecSettings` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
