Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `sendVendorCommand` method.

The similar APIs provided have a high similarity score (above 0.99) and all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `sendVendorCommand` method is likely to require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the sink code entries for the similar APIs and the `sendVendorCommand` method are similar, involving the creation of a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` instance and posting it to a handler. This similarity in code structure further supports the idea that the `sendVendorCommand` method should have a similar access control level.

Given the high similarity scores and the similar code structure, it is reasonable to conclude that the `sendVendorCommand` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which is the same as the similar APIs provided.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
