Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getDeviceList` API.

The `getDeviceList` API is used to retrieve a list of devices connected to the HDMI system. The API has three different paths with varying levels of complexity, but all of them ultimately return a list of device information.

Looking at the similar APIs provided, we can see that they all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are related to HDMI control and device management, which suggests that they require a certain level of system or signature permission to access.

The `getInputDevices` API, for example, has a similarity score of 0.8947 with the `getDeviceList` API and requires `SYS_OR_SIG` permission. This API is used to retrieve a list of input devices connected to the HDMI system, which is similar to the purpose of the `getDeviceList` API.

Similarly, the `getActiveSource`, `canChangeSystemAudioMode`, `getSupportedTypes`, and `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` APIs all require `SYS_OR_SIG` permission and have similarity scores ranging from 0.7923 to 0.7159 with the `getDeviceList` API.

Based on this analysis, I would conclude that the `getDeviceList` API should also require `SYS_OR_SIG` permission to ensure that only authorized system or signature-level components can access the list of devices connected to the HDMI system.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
