Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method.

The method is used to retrieve allowed integer values for a specific CEC setting. The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access or modify CEC settings.

Considering the semantics of the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method, it appears to be a getter method that retrieves information about allowed integer values for a specific setting. As mentioned in the problem statement, if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level.

Given that the similar APIs have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, and considering the fact that this method is a getter, I would assign a lower or equal access control level to the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment is based on the fact that the method is related to CEC settings and similar APIs have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels. However, it's worth noting that if more information about the specific use case or requirements of this method were available, a more informed decision could be made.
