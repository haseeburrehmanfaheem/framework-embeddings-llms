To determine the access control level for the `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths (depths) with similar operations - interacting with `HdmiCecConfig`, checking settings, and returning allowed integer values for a given setting.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show how the method interacts with `HdmiCecConfig` to retrieve and process settings, ultimately returning an array of integers.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8925580978393555 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It interacts with `HdmiCecConfig` to retrieve allowed string values for a setting.
   - `getCecSettingIntValue`: With a similarity score of 0.887744665145874, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves the integer value of a specific setting from `HdmiCecConfig`.

Given these points:

- The method `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` is closely related to system settings and configurations, specifically dealing with HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) settings.
- Both similar APIs (`getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` and `getCecSettingIntValue`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to access the settings.
- The operations performed by `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` (retrieving allowed integer values for a setting) are akin to those of the similar APIs, suggesting it handles sensitive system configuration data.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues` should have a similar access control level to ensure consistency in securing system settings and configurations.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment aligns with the principle of least privilege and ensures that access to system settings, such as those related to HDMI CEC, is properly restricted to authorized components or processes.
