Based on the provided information, we can see that all similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are also part of the same class `Lcom.android.server.hdmi.HdmiControlService$BinderService` and have similar sink code entries. The similarities between these APIs and the `reportAudioStatus` method suggest that they are likely to be used in a similar context and require similar access control.

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `reportAudioStatus` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because all similar APIs have the same access control level, and there's no indication that the `reportAudioStatus` method requires a different level of access control.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
