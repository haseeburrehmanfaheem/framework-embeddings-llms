Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` API.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to HDMI control and settings, which is a sensitive area that requires proper authorization.

The `removeCecSettingChangeListener` API is also related to HDMI control and settings, as it removes a listener for CEC setting changes. Given its similarity to the other APIs, it is likely that this API also requires a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarity between the APIs and the sensitive nature of HDMI control and settings. It is essential to restrict access to these APIs to prevent unauthorized modifications or access to sensitive data.
