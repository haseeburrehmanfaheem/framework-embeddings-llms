To determine the access control level for the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

### Analysis of Code Paths:

1. **Path 1 (Depth 2)**: This path checks if a key exists in a map (`mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords.containsKey(p1)`). If the key exists, it returns without further action. This suggests some form of internal management or filtering but does not directly indicate the access control level.

2. **Path 2 (Depth 1)**: Here, the method calls `this.this$0.removeCecSettingChangeListener(p1, p2);`, which implies a delegation to another instance's method with the same name. This could suggest an internal or protected operation but doesn't directly reveal the access control level.

3. **Path 3 (Depth 0)**: Similar to Path 2, it delegates the call to `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$mremoveCecSettingChangeListener(this.this$0, p1, p2);`, indicating a possible internal or synthetic method call generated by the compiler.

### Analysis of Sink Code:

The sink code snippets show delegation patterns similar to Paths 2 and 3, reinforcing the idea that this method's implementation might involve internal or protected access patterns.

### Comparison with Similar APIs:

- **removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener**: Has a similarity score of 0.827818751335144 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. Its code involves initialization and removal of a listener, suggesting system-level operations that require either system or signature-level permissions.

- **removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener**: With a similarity score of 0.7969274520874023 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, this method also deals with removing a listener related to HDMI CEC volume control, implying it operates at a system or protected level.

Given these similarities and the nature of the operations (removal of listeners related to HDMI settings), it's reasonable to infer that `removeCecSettingChangeListener` would require access controls similar to its counterparts. These methods are involved in managing system-level resources or callbacks, which typically require more than normal permissions due to their potential impact on device functionality and security.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of code paths, sink code, and comparison with similar APIs that have SYS_OR_SIG access control levels, it's logical to conclude that `removeCecSettingChangeListener` should also have a SYS_OR_SIG access control level. This is because it likely interacts with system-level resources or requires protected access to manage HDMI CEC setting change listeners effectively.
