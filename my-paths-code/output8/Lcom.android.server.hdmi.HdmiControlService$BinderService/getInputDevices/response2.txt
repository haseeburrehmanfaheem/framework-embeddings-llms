Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I will determine the appropriate access control level for the `getInputDevices` method.

The `getInputDevices` method is used to retrieve a list of input devices. This operation does not seem to pose any significant security risks, as it only involves reading data about available devices and does not modify any system settings or sensitive information.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. **getDeviceList()**: Has a similarity score of 0.8947691917419434 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This method also deals with retrieving device lists, suggesting that operations related to fetching device information might require higher access control due to potential implications on system integrity or security.

2. **getCurrentRuleSetProvider()**: With a similarity score of 0.8245060443878174 and an access control level of NONE, this method seems unrelated in terms of functionality (dealing with rule set providers) but indicates that not all operations require high access control levels.

3. **getActiveSource()**: Has two entries with similarity scores of 0.7839547395706177 and 0.7642784714698792, both with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This method is involved in retrieving active source information related to HDMI devices, which might imply a need for system or signature-level access due to the nature of managing device connections.

4. **canChangeSystemAudioMode()**: With a similarity score of 0.732112467288971 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, this method checks if the system audio mode can be changed, indicating that operations affecting system settings might require higher levels of access control.

5. **getRemoteSessions()**: Having a similarity score of 0.7228108644485474 with an access control level of NONE, this method deals with retrieving remote sessions in the context of media routing, suggesting that not all operations related to fetching information about device or system states require high access control levels.

Given these observations:

- The `getInputDevices` method primarily involves reading data and does not modify system settings.
- Similar methods like `getDeviceList`, `getActiveSource`, and `canChangeSystemAudioMode` have higher access control levels (SYS_OR_SIG), possibly due to their implications on system security or integrity, even though they also involve reading device information.
- However, the nature of `getInputDevices` seems more aligned with operations that do not pose significant risks, similar to `getRemoteSessions`, which has an access control level of NONE.

Considering these points and the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, but acknowledging the need for some level of protection when dealing with system or device information, I would assign a moderate access control level. However, given the specific nature of this method and its similarity to others that have been assigned higher levels of access control due to their implications on system integrity or security, and considering the guidelines provided:

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
This decision reflects a cautious approach, recognizing the potential for this method to interact with sensitive system information, even though it's primarily a read operation. The choice of SYS_OR_SIG aligns with the access control levels assigned to similar methods that deal with device and system information, ensuring consistency in protecting system integrity and security.
