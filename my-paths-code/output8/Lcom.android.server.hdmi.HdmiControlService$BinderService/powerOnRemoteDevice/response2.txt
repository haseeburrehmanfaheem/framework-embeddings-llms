Based on the provided information, we can see that the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method has a high similarity with other APIs in the same class, such as `setSystemAudioMode`, `powerOffRemoteDevice`, `clearTimerRecording`, `deviceSelect`, and `portSelect`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The sink code entries for these similar APIs also show a consistent pattern of creating a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` instance and posting it to the handler, which is similar to the sink code entries for the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method.

Given this information, it's reasonable to conclude that the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method should have the same access control level as its similar APIs, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because these methods are likely performing similar operations and require similar levels of protection.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `powerOnRemoteDevice` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
