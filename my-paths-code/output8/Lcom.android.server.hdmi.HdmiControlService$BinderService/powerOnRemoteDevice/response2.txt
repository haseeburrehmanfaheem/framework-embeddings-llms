To determine the access control level for the `powerOnRemoteDevice` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2), but all of them involve creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` and either posting it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler or running it on a service thread. This indicates that the method is interacting with system-level services or threads.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets are similar across all paths, focusing on executing a runnable (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$10`) either directly on a service thread or via a handler. This suggests interaction with potentially sensitive system operations.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `setSystemAudioMode(ZLandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves posting a runnable to a handler, similar to the paths in `powerOnRemoteDevice`.
   - `powerOffRemoteDevice(II)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, with its code being very similar to that of `powerOnRemoteDevice`, involving posting a runnable.

Given these points:
- The method interacts with system-level components (service threads, handlers).
- Similar methods (`setSystemAudioMode` and `powerOffRemoteDevice`) have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they require either system or signature-level permission to execute due to their potential impact on device operation.

**Conclusion**: Based on the method's interaction with system components and the similarity in code and functionality with other methods that have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is reasonable to conclude that `powerOnRemoteDevice` should also be assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
