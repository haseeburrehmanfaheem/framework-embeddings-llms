Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `startTimerRecording` method.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. The similarities between these APIs and `startTimerRecording` are high, ranging from 0.9945979714393616 to 0.9956243634223938. This indicates that the behavior and functionality of these APIs are closely related.

Given the similarities in code structure and sink code entries, it is reasonable to conclude that the `startTimerRecording` method should have a similar access control level. The method appears to be interacting with the HDMI control service and performing actions that require system-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, I assign the following access control level to the `startTimerRecording` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level privileged entities can access the `startTimerRecording` method, aligning with the security requirements of similar APIs in the HDMI control service.
