To determine the access control level for the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `addOnAssociationsChangedListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `registerCallback`: NONE
   - `registerContentCaptureOptionsCallback`: NONE
   - `unregisterCallback`: NONE
   - `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`: SYS_OR_SIG

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   The sink code for `addCecSettingChangeListener` involves registering a listener (`IHDmiCecSettingChangeListener`) with a `RemoteCallbackList`. This operation is similar to what's seen in the other APIs, where listeners are registered or unregistered.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - If a setter method (like adding a listener) requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.
   - However, if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level.

4. **Analysis of Similar APIs**:
   - `addOnAssociationsChangedListener` and `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` have SYS_OR_SIG access control levels, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to modify listener registrations.
   - The other similar APIs (`registerCallback`, `registerContentCaptureOptionsCallback`, `unregisterCallback`) have NONE access control level, suggesting that registering or unregistering listeners in those contexts does not pose significant security risks.

5. **Decision**:
   Given the similarities with `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` (which also deals with HDMI CEC settings and has a SYS_OR_SIG access control level) and considering the nature of adding a listener which can potentially affect system behavior or reveal sensitive information, it's reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `addCecSettingChangeListener`.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis of similar APIs, especially those related to HDMI CEC settings and listener registrations that require system or signature-level permissions, the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method should have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
