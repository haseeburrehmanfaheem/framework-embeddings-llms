To determine the access control level for the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves registering a listener (`IHdmiCecSettingChangeListener`) with a `RemoteCallbackList`. This is similar to the patterns seen in the provided similar APIs.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `addOnAssociationsChangedListener`: This has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission. The code snippet shows registration with an additional parameter (`Integer.valueOf(p2)`), suggesting a need for specific, possibly privileged, information.
   - `registerCallback`: This method has an access control level of `NONE`, implying no special permissions are required beyond the normal application execution context. Its simplicity in registering a callback without any additional parameters or checks aligns with this lower access control requirement.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code for `addCecSettingChangeListener` involves creating a new `RemoteCallbackList`, putting it into a records map, registering a change listener with `mHdmiCecConfig`, and then registering the provided listener (`p2`) with the list retrieved from the map. This sequence suggests interaction with system-level components (`mHdmiCecConfig`), which might imply a need for elevated access control.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The complexity and the involvement of system components (like `mHdmiCecConfig`) in `addCecSettingChangeListener` are more aligned with `addOnAssociationsChangedListener`, which has a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`).
   - However, the actual registration process (`v9.register(p2)`) is simpler and does not explicitly require or check for system-level permissions within the provided code snippets.

Given these considerations, while there's an interaction with potentially privileged components, the method itself doesn't explicitly enforce or require system-level permissions in its registration process based on the provided code. However, considering the similarity in functionality and potential implications of registering listeners with system components, a cautious approach would lean towards requiring some level of access control.

But since the actual registration (`v9.register(p2)`) does not involve explicit permission checks or handling that would necessitate `SYS_OR_SIG` access control based on the provided snippets, and considering the simplicity of the operation (registering a listener), it seems more reasonable to align its access control level with operations that are necessary for the normal functioning of applications but do not pose significant risks.

Therefore, considering the need for some form of access control due to interaction with system components but lacking explicit evidence of requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions within the provided code context, a balanced approach would suggest an access control level that acknowledges potential risks without overestimating them.

**Access Control Decision**: Given the method's functionality and comparisons, if we must choose from the provided options (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`) without explicit evidence of high-risk operations or specific permission requirements within the snippets, a conservative yet informed choice would lean towards `NORMAL`. This reflects the method's involvement with system components and listener registration without clear indications of dangerous operations or the necessity for signature or system-level permissions.
