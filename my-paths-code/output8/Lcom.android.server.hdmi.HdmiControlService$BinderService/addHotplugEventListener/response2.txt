Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addHotplugEventListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `addHotplugEventListener` method is used to add a listener for hotplug events, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper authorization. The method's sink code creates a new `HdmiControlService$HotplugEventListenerRecord` object, links it to death using the `IBinder` interface, and adds it to the `mHotplugEventListenerRecords` list.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permissions to access. These APIs are also related to adding listeners for various HDMI events, such as device events, control status changes, system audio mode changes, input changes, and volume control feature changes.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `addHotplugEventListener` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `addHotplugEventListener` method should also require a similar level of access control. Therefore, based on the provided information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `addHotplugEventListener` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
