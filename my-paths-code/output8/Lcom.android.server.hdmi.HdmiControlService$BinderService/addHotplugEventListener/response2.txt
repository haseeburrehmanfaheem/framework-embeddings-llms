Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addHotplugEventListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `addHotplugEventListener` method has three different code paths, but they all ultimately lead to the creation of a new `HdmiControlService$HotplugEventListenerRecord` object and the addition of it to the `mHotplugEventListenerRecords` list. This is similar to the behavior of the two provided similar APIs: `addDeviceEventListener` and `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`.

Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the underlying functionality. The code snippets for these APIs also show similarities with the sink code provided for `addHotplugEventListener`, such as creating a new record object and linking it to the death of the provided binder.

Given these similarities, it is reasonable to conclude that the `addHotplugEventListener` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method appears to be interacting with system-level functionality and requires a similar level of permission to access the underlying resources.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `addHotplugEventListener` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
