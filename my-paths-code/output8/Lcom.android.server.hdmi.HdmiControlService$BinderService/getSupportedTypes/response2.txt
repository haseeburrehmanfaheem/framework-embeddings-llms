To determine the access control level for the `getSupportedTypes` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method seems to be interacting with `HdmiControlService` and accessing local devices through `mLocalDevices`. It initializes a binder call in some paths and sets the work source UID to the calling UID in another path. However, it does not directly perform any operations that would typically require dangerous permissions (e.g., accessing sensitive user data, making network requests, or executing commands that could potentially harm the system).

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show interactions with `HdmiControlService` and local devices but do not indicate any inherently dangerous operations.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs (`getDeviceList()Ljava/util/List;`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods interact with the HDMI CEC network and return a list of safe CE devices locked, which suggests they are dealing with system-level or signature-protected functionality.

Given this analysis:

- The method does not seem to perform any operations that would require **DANGEROUS** permissions directly.
- It interacts with system services (`HdmiControlService`) but doesn't execute commands that could harm the system directly, which might suggest a need for **SYS_OR_SIG** if it's closely related to system-level functionality or requires signature protection.
- The similarity in access control levels of the provided APIs (`SYS_OR_SIG`) and the nature of `getSupportedTypes` interacting with system services (though not explicitly shown to require signature or system level permissions in its operation) leans towards a **SYS_OR_SIG** classification, considering it's dealing with HDMI control service which is typically a system-level functionality.

However, without explicit evidence that `getSupportedTypes` requires system or signature-level protection for its operation (e.g., accessing sensitive data, performing actions that could compromise the system), one might argue for a less restrictive access control. Yet, given the context and similarities to other APIs classified as **SYS_OR_SIG**, it seems reasonable to align with this classification due to the method's interaction with system services.

**Conclusion**: Based on the provided information and analysis, assigning an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG** to `getSupportedTypes` seems appropriate due to its interaction with system-level services and similarities with other APIs that have been classified under this level.
