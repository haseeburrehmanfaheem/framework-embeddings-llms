Based on the provided information, I will analyze the given API and its similar APIs to determine the access control level for the `getSupportedTypes` method.

The `getSupportedTypes` method is part of the `HdmiControlService$BinderService` class and has three different code paths with varying depths. The method interacts with the `mLocalDevices` list, which seems to be related to HDMI devices.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `getDeviceList()` in `Lcom.android.server.hdmi.HdmiControlService$BinderService`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7356382608413696 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It returns a list of safe CE devices, which is related to the HDMI domain.
2. `getPortInfo()` in `Lcom.android.server.hdmi.HdmiControlService$BinderService`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7293099164962769 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It returns port information, which might be related to the HDMI devices.
3. `unregisterDeviceServer()` in `Lcom.android.server.midi.MidiService`: This API has a low similarity score of 0.7271062135696411 and an access control level of `NONE`. Since it's not closely related to the HDMI domain, its access control level might not be relevant.
4. `getActiveSource()` in `Lcom.android.server.hdmi.HdmiControlService$BinderService`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7185218930244446 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It returns the active HDMI source, which is related to the HDMI domain.
5. `listModules()` in `Lcom.android.server.broadcastradio.BroadcastRadioService$ServiceImpl`: This API has a low similarity score of 0.7155919671058655 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although it's not closely related to the HDMI domain, its access control level might indicate that listing devices or modules requires some level of system or signature protection.

Considering the similarities in the APIs and their access control levels, I notice that most of the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require either system or signature-level permissions to access the HDMI-related information. Since the `getSupportedTypes` method interacts with the `mLocalDevices` list, which is related to the HDMI domain, it's likely that this method also requires a similar level of protection.

Given the analysis above, I conclude that the `getSupportedTypes` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it's consistent with the other APIs in the same domain and ensures proper protection for accessing HDMI-related information.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
