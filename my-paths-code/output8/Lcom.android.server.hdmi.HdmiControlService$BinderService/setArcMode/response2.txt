Based on the provided information, we can see that all similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are also part of the same class `Lcom/android/server/hdmi/HdmiControlService$BinderService` and have similar sink code entries.

The method `setArcMode` is used to set the ARC (Audio Return Channel) mode, which is a feature that allows audio to be sent from a TV back to an external device, such as a soundbar. This feature is typically controlled by the system or a privileged application, and therefore requires a higher level of access control.

Given the similarities between `setArcMode` and the other APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `setArcMode` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only system or signature-privileged applications can modify the ARC mode, preventing unauthorized access and potential security risks.
