Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `setCecSettingStringValue` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setCecSettingStringValue` method interacts with the `HdmiCecConfig` class, which is also used by the similar APIs `setCecSettingIntValue` and `getCecSettingStringValue`. These similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access the HDMI CEC settings.

The sink code provided shows that the `setCecSettingStringValue` method stores values in the `HdmiCecConfig` using methods like `storeValue` and `storeSystemProperty`. This suggests that the method is modifying sensitive settings, which requires careful access control.

Considering the similarity between the `setCecSettingStringValue` method and the other APIs, as well as the sensitive nature of the HDMI CEC settings, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setCecSettingStringValue` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
