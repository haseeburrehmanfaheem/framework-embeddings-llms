Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will analyze the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method to determine its access control level.

The method is a getter that retrieves allowed CEC setting string values. The similar APIs provided are also related to CEC settings and have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that accessing or modifying CEC settings requires system or signature-level permission.

Considering the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, but still requires some level of protection, I will assign an access control level to the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is based on the similarity with other CEC setting-related APIs and the need to protect access to CEC settings, even if it's just a getter method. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level ensures that only system or signature-level authorized components can access this information.
