To determine the access control level for the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths with varying depths, all of which interact with `HdmiCecConfig` and its settings. They retrieve allowed string values for specific settings.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `HdmiCecConfig$Setting`, retrieving default values, and manipulating lists of allowed string values.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getCecSettingStringValue(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` has a similarity score of 0.9362739324569702 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method retrieves a string value for a specific setting.
   - `getCecSettingIntValue(Ljava/lang/String;)I` has a similarity score of 0.9207693338394165 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method retrieves an integer value for a setting.

Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that interacting with HDMI CEC settings requires a certain level of system or signature permission to ensure that only authorized components can modify or retrieve these sensitive settings.

**Access Control Level Decision**:
Considering the method's interaction with sensitive HDMI CEC settings and the similarity with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures consistency in security practices for related APIs and protects sensitive settings from unauthorized access.
