Based on the provided information, we can see that the `sendKeyEvent` method has a high similarity with other APIs in the same class, such as `portSelect`, `sendVolumeKeyEvent`, `setSystemAudioVolume`, `deviceSelect`, and `setSystemAudioMode`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The sink code entries for these similar APIs also show a similar pattern of creating a new instance of a runnable class (e.g., `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2`, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$4`, etc.) and posting it to a handler using `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`.

Given this information, it is likely that the `sendKeyEvent` method requires a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized access to the HDMI control service.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the sink code entries, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `sendKeyEvent` method.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
