Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `sendStandby` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `sendStandby` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them create an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$16` and post it to a handler or run it on a service thread. The sink code entries for these paths are similar to those found in the similar APIs.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs also create instances of various inner classes and post them to handlers or run them on service threads, similar to the `sendStandby` method.

Given the similarities between the `sendStandby` method and the provided APIs, it is likely that the `sendStandby` method requires a similar level of access control. Therefore, I conclude that the access control level for the `sendStandby` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
