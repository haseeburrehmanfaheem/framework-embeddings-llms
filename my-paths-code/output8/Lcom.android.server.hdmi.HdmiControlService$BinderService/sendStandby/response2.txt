To determine the access control level for the `sendStandby` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of the `sendStandby` method involve creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$16` and then either posting it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler or running it on a service thread.
   - The key operations in these paths are related to sending standby signals, which implies interaction with hardware or system-level services.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `setSystemAudioMode(ZLandroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code creates a `HdmiControlService$BinderService$8` instance and posts it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, similar to the operations in the paths of `sendStandby`.
   - Another similar API, `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V`, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It creates a `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` instance and posts it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, showing a pattern consistent with system or signature-level access controls.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the similarities in code patterns between `sendStandby` and the provided APIs (`setSystemAudioMode` and `powerOnRemoteDevice`), which both require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it's reasonable to infer that `sendStandby` also requires a similar level of access control.
   - The operations involved (e.g., sending standby signals) suggest that this method interacts with system-level functionalities or hardware controls, aligning with the need for either system or signature-level permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of code paths and similarities with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is logical to conclude that the `sendStandby` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
