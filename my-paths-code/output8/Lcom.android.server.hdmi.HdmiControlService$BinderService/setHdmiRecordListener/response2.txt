Based on the provided information, we can see that all similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are related to setting listeners for various HDMI events, and they all seem to require a system or signature-level permission to access.

The `setHdmiRecordListener` method also sets a listener for HDMI record events, which is similar to the other APIs. The sink code for this method creates a new `HdmiControlService$HdmiRecordListenerRecord` object and links it to the death of the provided `IHdmiRecordListener` object.

Given the similarities between this method and the other APIs, it's likely that `setHdmiRecordListener` also requires a system or signature-level permission to access. Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
