To determine the access control level for the `setHdmiRecordListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves creating a new instance of `HdmiControlService$HdmiRecordListenerRecord`, setting it to `mRecordListenerRecord`, and linking the binder to death. This pattern suggests interaction with system-level services or components that require specific permissions.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - `setInputChangeListener`: Has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The method creates a listener record similar to `setHdmiRecordListener` and links it to death, suggesting system or signature-level permission is required for such operations.
   - `addVendorCommandListener`: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It adds a vendor command listener record, which implies interaction with potentially sensitive hardware or system components.

3. **Semantics**: The method names and their functionalities imply that they are dealing with hardware-level interactions (HDMI record listener, input change listener, vendor command listener), which typically require higher levels of access control to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

Given these points:

- The operations involve system-level components or sensitive hardware interactions.
- Similar APIs have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their nature of requiring system or signature-level permissions to execute safely and securely.

Therefore, the `setHdmiRecordListener` method should also be assigned an access control level that reflects its need for system or signature-level permission to operate securely.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
