Based on the provided information, we can see that all similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are also part of the same class `Lcom.android.server.hdmi.HdmiControlService$BinderService` and have similar sink code entries.

The method `toggleAndFollowTvPower` is also part of the same class and has similar sink code entries, which suggests that it should have a similar access control level.

Given the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that all similar APIs have the same access control level, and the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method has similar characteristics and sink code entries. It's also worth noting that the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that this method requires a system or signature-level permission to be called, which is consistent with the other similar APIs.
