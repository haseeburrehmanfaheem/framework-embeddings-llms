To determine the access control level for the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method, we should analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs, focusing on their interactions with sinks and assigned access control levels.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of `toggleAndFollowTvPower` involve creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$6` and then either posting it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler or running it on the service thread directly.
   - The key sink interactions are through `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v13)` (or similar) and `boolean v16 = this.mHandler.post(v14)`, which indicate execution of the runnable either immediately on the service thread or posting it to a handler for later execution.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar API `setArcMode(Z)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code creates a `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14` instance and posts it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler, which is somewhat similar to the paths in `toggleAndFollowTvPower`.
   - The other similar API `oneTouchPlay(Landroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlCallback;)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It creates a `HdmiControlService$BinderService$5` instance and posts it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, similar to the pattern observed in `toggleAndFollowTvPower`.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and considering their code patterns are comparable to those found in `toggleAndFollowTvPower`, it suggests that `toggleAndFollowTvPower` likely requires a similar level of access control.
   - The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that the method can be invoked by system or signature applications, reflecting its potential to interact with sensitive system functionalities.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of code paths and the comparison with similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it shares similarities in execution patterns and likely interacts with system-level functionalities akin to its similar APIs.
