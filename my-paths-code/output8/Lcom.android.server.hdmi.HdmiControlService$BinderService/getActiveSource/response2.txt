To determine the access control level for the `getActiveSource` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Path Analysis**:
   - Path 1 (depth 2) involves checking the active source of an HDMI device, specifically a playback device (`HdmiCecLocalDevicePlayback`). If such a device is not found or is not the active source, it proceeds to check other conditions and may construct a new `HdmiDeviceInfo` object based on the active port ID.
   - Path 2 (depth 1) also checks for an active source but involves calling `HdmiControlService.playback()` and `HdmiControlService.tv()` to get the active path or port ID, which is then used to find or construct a relevant `HdmiDeviceInfo` object.
   - Path 3 (depth 0) simply calls another instance's `getActiveSource` method, suggesting a delegation or wrapper pattern.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets show interactions with HDMI devices and networks, specifically getting local devices by type (`HdmiCecLocalDevicePlayback`, `HdmiCecLocalDeviceTv`), checking their states (active source, active path, port ID), and constructing or retrieving `HdmiDeviceInfo` objects.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - These methods interact with HDMI devices and services, checking capabilities like changing system audio modes or the presence of system audio devices.

Given these analyses, the `getActiveSource` method primarily interacts with HDMI devices and services to determine the active source. This interaction does not explicitly modify system settings or sensitive data but rather retrieves information about the current state of HDMI connections.

However, considering the similar APIs provided (`canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z`) are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that operations related to HDMI control and system audio management are considered sensitive and require higher access control levels. The `getActiveSource` method, while not directly changing system settings, operates within a similar domain of HDMI device management.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the context provided by the ground truth APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getActiveSource` method should also be classified under a higher access control level due to its interaction with system-level HDMI services and devices.

**Access Control Level Decision**:

Given the information and analysis above, the most appropriate access control level for the `getActiveSource` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs that interact with system audio and HDMI device management capabilities.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision reflects the method's involvement in system-level operations related to HDMI device control, even though its primary function is informational (retrieving the active source). The similarity with other APIs that have been classified as requiring system or signature-level permissions supports this conclusion.
