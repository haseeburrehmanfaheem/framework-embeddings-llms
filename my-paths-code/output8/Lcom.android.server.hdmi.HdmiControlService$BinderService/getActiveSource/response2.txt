Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `getActiveSource` API.

The `getActiveSource` API is used to retrieve the active source device in the HDMI network. This operation does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it only involves reading information about the current state of the HDMI network.

However, considering the similar APIs provided, such as `canChangeSystemAudioMode`, `getSystemAudioMode`, `getDeviceList`, `getPortInfo`, and `getInputDevices`, all of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that accessing information about the HDMI network and devices may require a certain level of privilege.

Given this context, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getActiveSource` API, as it is likely that this operation should only be allowed for system or signature-protected applications.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarities between the `getActiveSource` API and other APIs that interact with the HDMI network and devices, which all require a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
