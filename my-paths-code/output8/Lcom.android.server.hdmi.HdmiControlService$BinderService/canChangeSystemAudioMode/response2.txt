Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getSystemAudioMode()Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
2. `getActiveSource()Landroid/hardware/hdmi/HdmiDeviceInfo;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
3. `getPortInfo()Ljava/util/List;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
4. `shouldHandleTvPowerKey()Z` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`
5. `getDeviceList()Ljava/util/List;` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access the HDMI-related functionality.

The `canChangeSystemAudioMode` method is related to the HDMI audio mode and seems to be checking if the system audio mode can be changed. This functionality is likely to be restricted to system or signature-level permissions, similar to the other APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
