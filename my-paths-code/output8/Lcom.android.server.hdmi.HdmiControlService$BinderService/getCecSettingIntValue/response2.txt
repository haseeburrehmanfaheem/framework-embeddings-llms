To determine the access control level for the `getCecSettingIntValue` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all essentially aim to retrieve an integer value related to a CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) setting based on the input string `p1`. The retrieval process involves checking settings, default values, and in some cases, accessing shared preferences.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show how the method interacts with various objects and methods to achieve its goal, including retrieving settings, getting default values, and parsing integers from strings.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are mentioned, both named `getCecSettingStringValue` with high similarity scores. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The code for these similar APIs involves getting a `HdmiCecConfig` object and then retrieving a string value based on the input parameter `p1`, either directly or through a setting.

Given this information, we can infer the following:

- **Similarity in Purpose**: All methods (including the similar APIs) are involved in retrieving CEC setting values. The difference lies in the type of value being retrieved (integer vs. string).
- **Access Control Level of Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to access the CEC settings.
- **Nature of getCecSettingIntValue**: This method, like its string counterparts, deals with sensitive device settings (CEC settings). Accessing such settings could potentially impact the device's behavior or security, especially if these settings are modified.

Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that accessing integer CEC setting values should be subject to similar restrictions as accessing string CEC setting values, given their potential impact on device functionality and security.

Therefore, based on the similarity in purpose and the access control levels of the provided APIs, the `getCecSettingIntValue` method should also have an access control level that reflects the need for system or signature-level permission to ensure that only authorized components can access and potentially modify these settings.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege, ensuring that access to potentially sensitive device settings is restricted to components that have a legitimate need for such access.
