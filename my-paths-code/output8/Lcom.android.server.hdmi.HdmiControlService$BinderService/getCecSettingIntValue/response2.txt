Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getCecSettingIntValue` method.

The method is used to retrieve the integer value of a CEC setting. The similar APIs provided, such as `getCecSettingStringValue`, `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues`, `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues`, and `getUserCecSettings`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that accessing or retrieving CEC settings is considered a sensitive operation that requires system or signature-level permission.

Additionally, the method `setCecSettingIntValue` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies that setting CEC settings is also a sensitive operation. Given that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getCecSettingIntValue` method should have a similar or lower access control level.

Considering these factors, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getCecSettingIntValue` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment ensures that accessing CEC settings is properly restricted and aligned with the access control levels of similar APIs.
