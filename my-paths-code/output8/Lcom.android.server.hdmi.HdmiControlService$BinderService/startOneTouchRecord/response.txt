To identify the sinks in the provided API paths, we need to analyze each path and apply the given rules. 

For Path 1:
```java
public void startOneTouchRecord(int p1, byte[] p2){
    HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();
    HdmiControlService$BinderService$17 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$17(p0,p1,p2);
    this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);
    return;
}
```
Here, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$17` object creation has a naming similarity with the API name and is created using the input parameters `p1` and `p2`. The `runOnServiceThread` method invocation also processes this object. Therefore, these instructions contribute to a sink.

For Path 2:
```java
public void startOneTouchRecord(int p1, byte[] p2){
    this.this$0.initBinderCall();
    HdmiControlService$BinderService$17 v3 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$17(p0,p1,p2);
    WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable v6 = new WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable(v3);
    boolean v8 = this.mHandler.post(v6);
    return;
}
```
Similar to Path 1, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$17` object creation and its usage in `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` construction contribute to a sink. The `post` method invocation also processes this object.

For Path 3:
```java
public void startOneTouchRecord(int p1, byte[] p2){
    HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);
    HdmiControlService$BinderService$17 v2 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$17(p0,p1,p2);
    this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v2);
    return;
}
```
Again, `HdmiControlService$BinderService$17` object creation and its usage in the `runOnServiceThread` method invocation contribute to a sink.

Based on these analyses, we can identify the following sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$17 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$17(p0,p1,p2);",
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
    ],
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$17 v3 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$17(p0,p1,p2);",
        "WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable v6 = new WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable(v3);",
        "boolean v8 = this.mHandler.post(v6);"
    ],
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$17 v2 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$17(p0,p1,p2);",
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v2);"
    ]
]
}
```
These sinks are ranked based on their sensitivity, with the most sensitive ones first. However, since all paths involve similar operations (object creation and method invocations), they can be considered equally sensitive in this context. The ranking here is primarily based on the order of presentation.
