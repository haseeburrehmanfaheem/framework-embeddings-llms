Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `getCecSettingStringValue` method.

The similar APIs have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access or modify the CEC settings. The `getCecSettingStringValue` method is a getter method that retrieves the value of a CEC setting, which is generally less sensitive than modifying it.

However, considering the similarities with the other APIs and the fact that reading data can still pose some security risks, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getCecSettingStringValue` method. This ensures that only system or signature-level components can access the CEC setting values, maintaining a consistent security posture.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment takes into account the similarities with other APIs and the potential security risks associated with reading CEC setting values.
