Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to HDMI control and event listening, which suggests that they handle sensitive operations.

The `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method is also related to HDMI control and event listening, as it adds a listener for HDMI control status changes. The sink code entries provided show that this method creates a new record for the listener, links the listener's binder to death, and adds the record to a list of listeners.

Given the similarities between this method and the other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, I conclude that the `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method should also have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This is because it handles sensitive operations related to HDMI control and event listening, which requires system or signature-level permission to access.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
