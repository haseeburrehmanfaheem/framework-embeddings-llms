Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method.

The similar APIs provided have the following characteristics:

* `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8553850054740906 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It is used to remove a listener, which is a related operation to adding a listener.
* `oneTouchPlay`, `toggleAndFollowTvPower`, `setArcMode`, and `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource`: These APIs have similarity scores ranging from 0.82180255651474 to 0.835366427898407 and all have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. They are related to controlling HDMI devices and have similar code patterns.

Considering the similarities in code patterns and the access control levels of the similar APIs, it can be inferred that the `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method is also related to controlling HDMI devices and requires a similar level of access control.

Since the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` API, which is closely related to `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`, has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, it is likely that `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` also requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method should have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
