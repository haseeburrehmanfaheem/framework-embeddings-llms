To determine the access control level for the `portSelect` method, we need to analyze its code snippets and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `portSelect` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): It creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2` and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): It initializes a binder call, creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2`, wraps it in a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, and posts it to a handler using `this.mHandler.post(v6)`.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): It initializes the binder call, creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2`, and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v2)`.

The sink code for all three paths involves creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2` and executing it either on the service thread or by posting to a handler.

Now, let's compare this with the similar APIs:

* `deviceSelect`: It has a similarity score of 0.99867182970047 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$1`, wraps it in a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, and posts it to a handler.
* `setSystemAudioMode`: It has a similarity score of 0.9981308579444885 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$8`, wraps it in a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, and posts it to a handler.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and involve creating a new instance of a binder service class, wrapping it in a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`, and posting it to a handler. Although the `portSelect` method's code paths differ slightly, they all involve executing a binder service class instance on the service thread or by posting to a handler.

Given the high similarity scores and the similar code patterns, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `portSelect` method.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
