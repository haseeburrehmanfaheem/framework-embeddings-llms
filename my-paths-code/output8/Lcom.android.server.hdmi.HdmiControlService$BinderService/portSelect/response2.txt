Based on the provided information, we can see that the `portSelect` method has similar APIs with access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These similar APIs are:

* `deviceSelect`
* `setSystemAudioMode`
* `powerOnRemoteDevice`
* `sendStandby`
* `sendKeyEvent`

All of these APIs have a high similarity score (above 0.995) and are also in the same class (`Lcom.android.server.hdmi.HdmiControlService$BinderService`). This suggests that they are likely to be related to each other and may require similar access control levels.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `portSelect` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method appears to be interacting with the HDMI control service in a way that is similar to the other APIs, and therefore likely requires a similar level of protection.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
