Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `setCecSettingIntValue` API.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs interact with the `HdmiCecConfig` class and its settings, which suggests that they are related to configuring HDMI settings.

The `setCecSettingIntValue` API also interacts with the `HdmiCecConfig` class and its settings, specifically setting an integer value for a given setting. This operation is likely to be sensitive, as it can affect the behavior of the HDMI system.

Given the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `setCecSettingIntValue` API should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized system or signature-level components can modify the HDMI settings.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the principle that writing data (in this case, modifying HDMI settings) usually poses a greater security risk than reading data, and therefore requires a higher level of access control.
