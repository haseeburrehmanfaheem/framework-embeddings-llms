To determine the access control level for the `setCecSettingIntValue` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, all of which involve interacting with `HdmiCecConfig` and its settings. This includes getting settings, checking their types (e.g., "int"), and storing values.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `HdmiCecConfig`, such as getting a setting, retrieving allowed values, and storing system properties or values directly.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `setCecSettingStringValue`: This method has a high similarity score (0.9107156991958618) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves getting a setting and storing a value, similar to the operations in `setCecSettingIntValue`.
   - `getAllowedCecSettingIntValues`: Although its primary function is to retrieve allowed values (with a similarity score of 0.8801571726799011), it's also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that even reading or manipulating settings related to CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) might require a certain level of system or signature permission.

Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that both similar APIs are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` as their access control level, it's reasonable to infer that `setCecSettingIntValue` should also have a similar access control requirement. The method's ability to modify CEC settings could potentially impact system behavior or security, aligning with the need for `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of code paths, sink code, and similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, the most appropriate access control level for `setCecSettingIntValue` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
