Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method.

The method has three different paths with depths 0, 1, and 2, but all of them ultimately lead to either posting a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` or running a task on the service thread. The sink code entries for these paths are similar to those found in other APIs with high similarity scores.

The similar APIs provided, such as `powerOnRemoteDevice`, `powerOffRemoteDevice`, `setSystemAudioMode`, `portSelect`, and `queryDisplayStatus`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the HDMI control service and perform actions that could potentially impact the system's state or security.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a similar access control level. The fact that all the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests that this level of protection is necessary for methods that interact with the HDMI control service and perform actions that could impact the system.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
