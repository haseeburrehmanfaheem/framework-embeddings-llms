To determine the access control level for the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11` and either posting it as a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler or running it on a service thread. This indicates that the method is interacting with system services and threads.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11`, which is similar across all paths, indicating a consistent pattern of execution within the service.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V** and **powerOffRemoteDevice(II)V** both have an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG**, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. Their code snippets involve creating different instances (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$9`, respectively) but follow a similar pattern of posting a `WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable` to a handler.

Given the similarities in code structure, interaction with system services, and the high similarity scores with other APIs that have an access control level of **SYS_OR_SIG**, it's reasonable to conclude that `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` also requires system or signature-level permissions. This is because all these methods seem to be part of a system service (HdmiControlService) that manages HDMI device interactions, which typically require elevated privileges.

Therefore, the access control level for `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` should be **SYS_OR_SIG**, reflecting its need for system or signature-level permissions due to its interaction with system services and threads.
