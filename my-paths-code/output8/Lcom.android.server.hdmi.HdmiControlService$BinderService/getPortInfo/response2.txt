Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `getPortInfo` method.

The similar APIs provided have the following characteristics:

* `canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z`, `getActiveSource()Landroid/hardware/hdmi/HdmiDeviceInfo;`, `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener(Landroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiControlStatusChangeListener;)V`, `getSupportedTypes()[I`, and `clearTimerRecording(II[B)V` all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* These APIs are related to HDMI control and seem to require a system or signature-level permission to access or modify sensitive information.

Considering the `getPortInfo` method, it appears to be retrieving information about ports, which might be sensitive. Although the method is a getter, which typically requires less restriction than a setter, the similar APIs suggest that even getters in this context may require a higher level of access control due to the sensitivity of the information being accessed.

Given the similarities and the context, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getPortInfo` method, as it is likely to be accessing sensitive information related to HDMI control.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
