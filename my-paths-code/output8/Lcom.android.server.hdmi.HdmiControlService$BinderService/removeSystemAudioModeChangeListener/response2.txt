Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method.

The similar APIs provided have the following access control levels:

* `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `removeCecSettingChangeListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener`: NONE

The `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method is similar to the above APIs, and its sink code entries involve unlinking a listener from death and removing it from a records list. This operation seems to be related to system-level functionality and requires proper authorization.

Considering the similarities with other APIs that have a SYS_OR_SIG access control level, I will assign the same level to the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the method is related to system-level functionality and requires proper authorization, similar to other APIs with a SYS_OR_SIG access control level. Additionally, the method's operation involves unlinking a listener from death and removing it from a records list, which may pose a security risk if not properly restricted.
