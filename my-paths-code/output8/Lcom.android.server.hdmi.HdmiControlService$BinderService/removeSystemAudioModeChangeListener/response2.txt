To determine the access control level for the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all essentially lead to removing a listener from a list of system audio mode change listeners. This involves unlinking the listener to prevent future callbacks and then removing it from the internal records.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code points involve interacting with an `IBinder` (a base class for a remotable object, the core part of a lightweight remote procedure call mechanism designed for high-performance) to unlink a death recipient and remove a record from a list. This is a critical operation as it affects how the system handles audio mode changes and communicates with other components.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, with high similarity scores (0.9204893708229065 and 0.8873475790023804). Both of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that the method can be invoked by system or signature applications, suggesting it requires a certain level of privilege to add or remove listeners for system audio mode changes.

Given this analysis:

- The operation of removing a system audio mode change listener is closely related to adding such a listener. Both operations are critical for managing how an application interacts with the system's audio mode changes.
- The similarity in access control levels between the provided similar APIs (`addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`) and the nature of the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method suggests that removing a listener should have a comparable level of restriction to adding one, as both actions can impact system behavior and security.

Therefore, considering the critical nature of this operation and its similarity to other methods with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
