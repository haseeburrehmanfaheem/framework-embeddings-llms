Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, we can make an informed decision about the access control level for the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to HDMI control and Cec settings, which are sensitive operations that require proper authorization.

The `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method is also related to HDMI control and is used to remove a listener for HDMI control status changes. Given its similarity to the other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is likely that this method also requires system or signature-level permission to access.

Additionally, the method modifies the internal state of the `HdmiControlService` by removing a listener from the `mHdmiControlStatusChangeListenerRecords` list. This modification can potentially affect the behavior of the service and may require proper authorization to prevent unauthorized changes.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the potential impact of modifying the internal state of the service, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
