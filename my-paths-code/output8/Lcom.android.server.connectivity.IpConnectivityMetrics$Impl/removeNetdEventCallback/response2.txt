To assign an access control level to the `removeNetdEventCallback` method in the `IpConnectivityMetrics$Impl` class, we need to consider the similarities and differences with other provided APIs, their assigned access control levels, and the semantics of those APIs.

1. **Similarity with `addNetdEventCallback`**: This API has a high similarity (1.0) and is also in the same class (`IpConnectivityMetrics$Impl`). It requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. Given that adding and removing callbacks are symmetric operations, it's reasonable to consider similar access control for both, especially since they interact with the same sink (`NetdEventListenerService.isValidCallerType(p1)`).

2. **Interaction with Sinks**: The method interacts with sinks related to network event callbacks, which suggests it deals with potentially sensitive network configuration or monitoring data. This interaction is similar to `addNetdEventCallback`, reinforcing the idea that they should have comparable access control levels.

3. **Comparison with Other APIs**:
   - `stopWatchlistLogging` and `startWatchlistLogging` in `NetworkWatchlistService` also deal with logging and network event callbacks, requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access control. Their similarity in functionality (starting/stopping logging) to adding/removing callbacks suggests that these operations might require similar protection levels.
   - `onPrivateDnsValidationEvent` has a lower similarity and is related to private DNS validation events. Its `NONE` access control level doesn't directly inform our decision due to its different context and lower similarity.
   - `isTrusted` in `MediaSessionService$SessionManagerImpl` deals with trusted media sessions and has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, but its functionality is quite different from network event callback management.

Given these considerations:
- The method's interaction with sensitive network configuration suggests it should have a restrictive access control.
- Its similarity to `addNetdEventCallback`, which requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, supports assigning a similar level.
- Other APIs dealing with network logging and callbacks also require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.

Therefore, considering the need for security in managing network event callbacks and the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that `removeNetdEventCallback` should also be assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
