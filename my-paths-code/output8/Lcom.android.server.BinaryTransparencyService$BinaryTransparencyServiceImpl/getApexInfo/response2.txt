To determine the access control level for the `getApexInfo` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getApexInfo` method appears to be related to retrieving information about APEX (Android Package EXtension) packages, which are a type of package that can be used to extend the Android framework. The method returns a map containing information about these packages.

Upon examining the sink code entries for the similar APIs, we notice that they all involve interactions with package managers, application info, and other sensitive data. The access control levels assigned to these APIs are mostly `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Given the similarities between the `getApexInfo` method and the provided APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also requires a certain level of access control to protect sensitive data. Since the method is retrieving information about APEX packages, which could potentially contain sensitive data, it is likely that this method should have an access control level similar to the ones assigned to the similar APIs.

Based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getApexInfo` method, as it is likely to require system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive data related to APEX packages.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `getApexInfo` method is protected with an appropriate level of access control, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and maintaining the security and integrity of the Android system.
