To determine the access control level for the `getApexInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method involves interactions with package managers, getting installed packages or APEXs, and updating binary measurements. It returns a map containing information about these packages or APEXs.

2. **Sink Code**: The sinks involve getting package information, updating measurements, and putting this information into a HashMap that is then returned.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getPackageScreenCompatMode(Ljava/lang/String;)I` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves checking compatibility modes for specific packages, which implies it deals with system-level or signature-protected operations.
   - `getWhitelistedRuleProviders()Ljava/util/List;` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require special permissions. It fetches a list of rule providers based on package information.

Given the nature of `getApexInfo`, which involves retrieving and processing package or APEX information, including interactions with the package manager and potentially system-level data (like binary measurements), we need to consider if this operation requires specific permissions or access levels.

- ** NORMAL** access control is typically assigned to methods that do not pose significant risks but may still require some level of protection or are part of a larger workflow that involves user data or preferences.
  
- **DANGEROUS** access control is for operations that can cause harm if misused, such as accessing sensitive user data without consent.

- **SYS_OR_SIG** (System or Signature) access control is applied to methods that require system-level permissions or are protected by the app's signature, indicating they should only be accessible to system apps or those signed with the platform key.

- **NONE** implies no specific protection is needed beyond what the app itself enforces.

Considering `getApexInfo` deals with package information and potentially system-level data (binary measurements), but does not explicitly indicate operations that would typically fall under **DANGEROUS** (like direct user data access or financial transactions) or require the highest level of system permissions (**SYS_OR_SIG**), we must weigh its similarity to the provided APIs.

The method's interaction with package managers and system services suggests it might need some form of protection, but given that `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` has an access control level of **NONE**, and considering the nature of operations in `getApexInfo`, it seems less likely to require **SYS_OR_SIG** unless explicitly dealing with sensitive system data or modifications.

However, since `getApexInfo` involves system-level inquiries (package management, binary measurements), but lacks direct indicators for **DANGEROUS** operations or the need for **SYS_OR_SIG** protections as seen in more sensitive system interactions, we should consider it might fall under a category that requires some level of access control due to its nature of querying and processing package-related data.

Given these considerations and without explicit evidence pointing towards **DANGEROUS** or **SYS_OR_SIG**, but recognizing the method's involvement with potentially sensitive operations (package management), a cautious approach would suggest an access control level that acknowledges its need for some protection, leaning towards **NORMAL** as it involves system-level inquiries but does not explicitly indicate misuse potential on the level of **DANGEROUS** or the high system permission requirements of **SYS_OR_SIG**.

Thus, considering the method's functionality and the provided context:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision reflects a balance between recognizing the method's interactions with system-level data and the absence of clear indicators for more restrictive access controls.
