Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getCurrentRuleSetVersion` method.

The `getCurrentRuleSetVersion` method appears to be retrieving metadata related to rule sets, which seems to be a relatively low-risk operation. The method is also similar to other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, such as `getCurrentRuleSetProvider()`, `getCurrentRules()`, and `getModuleMetadataPackageName()`.

Additionally, the method's implementation does not seem to involve any sensitive operations or data modifications that would require a higher level of access control. The method primarily involves reading metadata and returning version information, which is a relatively benign operation.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the method's implementation, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getCurrentRuleSetVersion` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This assignment is consistent with the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and the method's implementation does not involve any sensitive operations or data modifications that would require a higher level of access control.
