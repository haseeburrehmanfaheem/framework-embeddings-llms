To determine the access control level for the `getCurrentRuleSetVersion` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0) that essentially boil down to reading metadata from a file or cache and returning the version of the rule set. The key operations involve checking the calling UID, verifying if the caller is an allowed rule provider system app, and then accessing or returning the version string.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided all relate to reading metadata (specifically, `RuleMetadata`) and returning its version. This suggests that the primary concern of this method is accessing and exposing version information of rule sets.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are mentioned: `getCurrentRuleSetProvider()Ljava/lang/String;`, both with an access control level of `NONE`. 
   - These APIs also deal with rule set providers, suggesting that the operations related to reading or providing information about rule sets do not require stringent access controls in this context.

Given these points:

- The method's primary function is to retrieve and return version information, which does not inherently suggest a need for high-level access control (like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`) since it's more about accessing metadata rather than performing actions that could compromise system security or user privacy directly.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that operations related to rule sets, in this context, are not considered sensitive enough to warrant stricter access controls.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality and the precedent set by similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getCurrentRuleSetVersion` would be `NONE`.
