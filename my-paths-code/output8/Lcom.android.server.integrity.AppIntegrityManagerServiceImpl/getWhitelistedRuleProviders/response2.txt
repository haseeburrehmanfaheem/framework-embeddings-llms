Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, I will determine the appropriate access control level for the `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method.

The method `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` is used to retrieve a list of whitelisted rule providers. The code snippet shows that it interacts with the package manager and checks if an application is a system app. This operation seems to be related to retrieving information about packages, which is similar to the operations performed by the provided similar APIs.

The similar APIs (`getPackageScreenCompatMode`, `queryStatsForUid`, `queryStatsForPackage`, `getUserRestrictionSources`, and `getShortcuts`) all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are related to retrieving information about packages, applications, or users, and they all require a system or signature-level permission to access sensitive information.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method is retrieving sensitive information about packages and applications, which requires a system or signature-level permission to ensure that only authorized components can access this information.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
