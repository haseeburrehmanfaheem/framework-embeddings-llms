To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The code snippet for the `onReceive` method is:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
The sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Now, let's examine the similar APIs:

1. API Name: `onReceive(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/content/Intent;)V` with Similarity Score: 1.0
   - Access Control Level: NONE
   - Code:
     ```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0, p2, p1);
v1.start();
```
2. API Name: `onReceive(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/content/Intent;)V` with Similarity Score: 0.9965633153915405
   - Access Control Level: NONE
   - Code:
     ```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and their code snippets are almost identical to the code snippet of the `onReceive` method. The similarity in code and access control levels suggests that the `onReceive` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, the final access control level for the `onReceive` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
