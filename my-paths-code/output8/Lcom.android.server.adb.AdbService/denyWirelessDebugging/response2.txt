To determine the access control level for the `denyWirelessDebugging` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths. Path 1 involves sending an empty message via a handler, which doesn't directly interact with any sensitive operations or external systems that would typically require elevated permissions. Path 2 directly calls `denyWirelessDebugging` on `mDebuggingManager`, suggesting interaction with debugging functionality.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet shows a call to `denyWirelessDebugging` on `mDebuggingManager`, similar to the operation in path 2 of the method. This implies that the critical action related to access control is the interaction with `mDebuggingManager`.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **denyDebugging()V**: Has a high similarity score (0.920491635799408) and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows a similar pattern of interacting with `mDebuggingManager` by calling `denyDebugging()` on it.
   - **clearDebuggingKeys()V**: Also has a high similarity score (0.8785121440887451) and the same access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`). It interacts with `mDebuggingManager` by calling `clearDebuggingKeys()`.

Given these points, we can infer that:
- The method's interaction with `mDebuggingManager` for debugging-related operations is crucial.
- Similar methods with high similarity scores have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to execute their operations securely and correctly.

Considering the method's functionality and its similarity to other methods that require system or signature-level permissions, it's reasonable to conclude that `denyWirelessDebugging` should also be assigned a similar access control level to ensure consistency in managing debugging-related operations.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
