To determine the access control level for the `disablePairing` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**:
   - `clearDebuggingKeys()V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows a similar pattern of sending an empty message via `this.mHandler.sendEmptyMessage(6)`, which suggests interaction with a handler for debugging purposes.
   - `enablePairingByPairingCode()V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method directly calls `enablePairingByPairingCode()` on `this.mDebuggingManager`, indicating it deals with pairing operations, likely requiring system or signature-level permissions due to the sensitive nature of debugging and pairing.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code for `disablePairing` shows two paths:
     - Path 1 involves sending an empty message (message code 14) via a handler (`this.mHandler.sendEmptyMessage(14)`), which is similar to the operation in `clearDebuggingKeys()V`.
     - Path 2 directly calls `disablePairing()` on `this.mDebuggingManager`, akin to how `enablePairingByPairingCode()V` operates.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs (`clearDebuggingKeys()V` and `enablePairingByPairingCode()V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that operations related to debugging and pairing are considered sensitive.
   - The `disablePairing` method, by dealing with disabling pairing (a operation that could impact device security or functionality), likely requires a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized changes.

Based on the analysis above, the `disablePairing` method should have an access control level that reflects its potential to impact system security or functionality, similar to the levels assigned to the provided similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `disablePairing` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
