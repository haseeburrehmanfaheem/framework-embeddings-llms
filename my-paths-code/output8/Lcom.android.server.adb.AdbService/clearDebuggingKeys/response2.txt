Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `clearDebuggingKeys` method.

The `clearDebuggingKeys` method has a high similarity with other methods in the same class (`AdbService`) that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Specifically:

* `disablePairing()` has a similarity of 0.9942200779914856 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `denyDebugging()` has a similarity of 0.8933347463607788 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `denyWirelessDebugging()` has a similarity of 0.8785120844841003 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

These similar methods are all related to debugging and pairing, which suggests that they require a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized access.

Additionally, the method `runMaintenance()` in the `StorageManagerService` class has a similarity of 0.7638934254646301 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which further supports the assignment of a high access control level to `clearDebuggingKeys`.

The only method with a lower access control level (`NORMAL`) is `notifyStatsProviderWarningOrLimitReached()` in the `NetworkPolicyManagerService` class, but its similarity with `clearDebuggingKeys` is relatively low (0.7308478951454163).

Considering these factors, I conclude that the `clearDebuggingKeys` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to ensure the security and integrity of the debugging process.
