To determine the access control level for the `clearDebuggingKeys` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths. Path 1 sends an empty message via a handler (`this.mHandler.sendEmptyMessage(6)`) if `this.mDebuggingManager` is 0. Path 2 calls `clearDebuggingKeys()` on `this.mDebuggingManager` under the same condition.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `mDebuggingManager` and `mHandler`, which are related to debugging functionality.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `disablePairing()V`: This method has a high similarity score (0.9942200183868408) with `clearDebuggingKeys`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission, typically because it affects system settings or security.
   - `denyDebugging()V`: With a moderate to high similarity score (0.8933346271514893), this method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It directly impacts debugging capabilities, which can be sensitive from a security perspective.

Given these points:

- Both similar APIs (`disablePairing` and `denyDebugging`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are considered to affect system settings or security.
- The operations within `clearDebuggingKeys` (either sending a message via a handler or calling another method on `mDebuggingManager`) could potentially impact the device's debugging state, which might be sensitive from a security standpoint.

Therefore, considering the similarity in functionality and potential security implications with the provided APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `clearDebuggingKeys` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
