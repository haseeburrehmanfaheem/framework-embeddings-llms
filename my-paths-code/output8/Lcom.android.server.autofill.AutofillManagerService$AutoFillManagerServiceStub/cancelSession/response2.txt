To determine the access control level for the `cancelSession` method in the `Lcom.android.server.autofill.AutofillManagerService$AutoFillManagerServiceStub` class, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Analysis of `cancelSession` Method**:
   - The method interacts with sensitive data and services related to autofill functionality.
   - It checks the calling UID (`IAutoFillManager$Stub.getCallingUid()`) and compares it with `Session.uid`, indicating a form of authentication or authorization check.
   - Depending on the conditions, it performs actions like removing sessions (`v7.removeFromServiceLocked();`), destroying services (`RemoteFillService v18 = Session.destroyLocked();`), or updating session states.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - `setHasCallback(IIZ)V`: This method has a similarity score ranging from 0.8696 to 0.9049 and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. It interacts with the autofill service but does not seem to perform actions that are significantly more sensitive than `cancelSession`.
   - `finishSession(III)V`: With a similarity score between 0.8587 and 0.8960, it also has an access control level of `NONE`. This method appears to finalize sessions and may interact with save results but does not indicate higher sensitivity compared to `cancelSession`.
   - `setAuthenticationResult(Landroid/os/Bundle;III)V`: Having a similarity score between 0.8613 and 0.8899, it is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method deals with setting authentication results, which could be considered more sensitive due to its direct involvement in the authentication process.
   - `getAutofillServiceComponentName(Lcom/android/internal/os/IResultReceiver;)V` and `isServiceEnabled(ILjava/lang/String;Lcom/android/internal/os/IResultReceiver;)V`: Both have access control levels of `NONE`. They seem to provide information about the autofill service or its status without directly modifying sensitive data.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that `cancelSession` involves potentially sensitive operations like destroying sessions and updating session states, but does not explicitly deal with setting authentication results (which is considered more sensitive), it seems reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects its moderate sensitivity.
   - The method's interactions with UIDs and session management suggest a need for some form of protection, but it does not reach the level of `SYS_OR_SIG` as seen in `setAuthenticationResult`.
   - Considering the provided similarities and the nature of operations performed by `cancelSession`, an access control level of `NORMAL` seems appropriate. This reflects its need for protection without elevating it to the highest sensitivity category.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision balances the method's involvement in session management and potential security implications with the observed behaviors of similar APIs within the autofill service framework.
