To determine the access control level for the `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method is used to disable owned autofill services. It checks if the calling user has a valid service, and if not, it proceeds to clear the autofill service settings for that user. This involves modifying system settings, which can be considered a sensitive operation.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. `getUserDataId`: This method retrieves user data ID and does not modify any system settings. Its access control level is NONE.
2. `getServiceSettingsActivity`: This method returns the settings activity for a content capture service and does not involve modifying system settings. Its access control level is NONE.
3. `isServiceEnabled`: This method checks if an autofill service is enabled and returns the result. It does not modify any system settings. Its access control level is NONE.
4. `getAutofillServiceComponentName`: This method retrieves the component name of the autofill service and does not involve modifying system settings. Its access control level is NONE.
5. `cancelSession`: This method cancels an autofill session, which involves modifying the session state. However, its access control level is NONE.

Although all similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, we should consider the sensitivity of the operation performed by `disableOwnedAutofillServices`. Modifying system settings can be considered a more sensitive operation than simply retrieving data or checking service status.

However, based on the provided information and the fact that the similar APIs with potentially less sensitive operations have an access control level of NONE, it seems reasonable to assign a moderate access control level to `disableOwnedAutofillServices`.

Given the choices:

- NONE: No access control restrictions.
- NORMAL: Normal access control restrictions.
- DANGEROUS: Dangerous access control restrictions, typically requiring explicit user consent or system-level permissions.
- SYS_OR_SIG: System or signature access control restrictions, typically requiring system-level permissions or a specific signature.

Considering the operation's sensitivity and comparing it with the similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of NORMAL to `disableOwnedAutofillServices`, as it involves modifying system settings but does not seem to require the highest level of access control (DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG).

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is based on the provided information and the analysis of similar APIs. However, please note that a more detailed evaluation of the Android system's security model and specific requirements might lead to a different conclusion.
