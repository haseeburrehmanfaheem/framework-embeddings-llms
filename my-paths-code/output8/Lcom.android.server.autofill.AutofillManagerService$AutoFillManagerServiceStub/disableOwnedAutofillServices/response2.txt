To determine the access control level for the `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve checking the calling user ID and service information. In paths 1 and 2, it clears the calling identity, checks component names, logs metrics, and updates secure settings related to autofill services.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `AbstractPerUserSystemService`, getting the calling UID, clearing calling identity, comparing component names, logging actions, and updating secure settings for autofill services.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getUserDataId` has an access control level of `NONE`. It involves getting the user data ID for the calling user, checking if it's called by a service, and sending results.
   - `getServiceSettingsActivity` also has an access control level of `NONE`. This method retrieves settings activity information for a service and sends it back.

Given these details:

- The `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method interacts with system services, checks calling UIDs, and updates secure settings. These operations suggest that the method could potentially affect system security or user data privacy.
- The similar APIs (`getUserDataId` and `getServiceSettingsActivity`) both have an access control level of `NONE`, but they seem to involve less critical operations compared to updating secure settings for autofill services.
- However, considering the nature of `disableOwnedAutofillServices`, which involves disabling owned autofill services and potentially accessing or modifying user data (indirectly through service settings), it seems more aligned with operations that require careful access control.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `disableOwnedAutofillServices` would be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects the method's potential impact on system settings and user data, without reaching the level of sensitivity associated with `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` operations. The method does not seem to directly handle sensitive information in a way that would categorize it as `DANGEROUS`, nor does it appear to require the privileges of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Thus, `NORMAL` seems like an appropriate balance.
