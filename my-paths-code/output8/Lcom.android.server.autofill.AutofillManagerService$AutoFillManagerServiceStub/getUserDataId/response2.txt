To determine the access control level for the `getUserDataId` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The API has three paths with different depths, but they all involve getting the calling user ID and interacting with `AbstractPerUserSystemService`. The key interactions include checking if the service is available for the user and sending results back to the caller.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`, `peekServiceForUserLocked`, and methods to send data back to the caller (`AutofillManagerService.send` or `this.this$0.send`). These are critical for understanding how user data is accessed and returned.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getFillEventHistory**: This API has a high similarity score with `getUserDataId`. It also deals with getting data (fill event history) for the current user and sending it back to the caller. The access control level for this similar API is `NONE`.

Given these points, we can infer that:
- The `getUserDataId` API is primarily concerned with retrieving and returning user-specific data.
- The interaction with `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` and `AbstractPerUserSystemService` suggests a need to ensure the request is legitimate and targeted at the correct user's service.
- The similar API, `getFillEventHistory`, has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that retrieving and returning user-specific data in this context does not require elevated permissions.

Considering these factors, the `getUserDataId` API seems to follow a pattern where it is designed to provide user-specific data without requiring special or dangerous permissions. The checks for the calling user ID and service availability are more about ensuring the request is properly targeted rather than enforcing strict access control.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of its interactions, the `getUserDataId` API would likely have an access control level of `NONE`, as it does not appear to perform actions that would require higher levels of permission or access control (like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`).
