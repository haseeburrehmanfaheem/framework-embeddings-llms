Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getUserDataId` method.

The `getUserDataId` method is similar to other methods in the same class, such as `getFillEventHistory`, `finishSession`, `getUserData`, and `getAvailableFieldClassificationAlgorithms`, which all have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods seem to be related to retrieving or sending data, and they do not appear to pose a significant security risk.

The `disableOwnedAutofillServices` method has a similar structure, but it has a different purpose, as it disables owned autofill services. However, its access control level is also `NONE`.

Considering the similarities between these methods and the fact that they all have an access control level of `NONE`, I would conclude that the `getUserDataId` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because the method seems to be related to retrieving user data, which is a relatively low-risk operation.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the analysis of similar APIs and their assigned access control levels, as well as the semantics of the `getUserDataId` method. If more information were available about potential security risks associated with this method, a different access control level might be warranted. However, based on the provided data, `NONE` seems to be an appropriate choice.
