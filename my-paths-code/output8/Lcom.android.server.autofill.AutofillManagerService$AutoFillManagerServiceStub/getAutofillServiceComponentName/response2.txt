Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "NONE" to the `getAutofillServiceComponentName` API.

The reasoning behind this decision is as follows:

1. The API is a getter method, which generally has less restrictive access control compared to setter methods.
2. The similar APIs provided, such as `getUserData`, `isServiceEnabled`, `restoreSession`, `cancelSession`, and `isFieldClassificationEnabled`, all have an access control level of "NONE".
3. These similar APIs interact with the same sinks (e.g., `AbstractPerUserSystemService`) and have similar code structures, suggesting that they are related to the same functionality.
4. The `getAutofillServiceComponentName` API does not seem to pose a significant security risk, as it only retrieves information about the autofill service component name.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `getAutofillServiceComponentName` API should be "NONE".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
