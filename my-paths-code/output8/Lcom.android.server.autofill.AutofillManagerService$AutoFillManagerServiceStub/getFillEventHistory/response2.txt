Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, it appears that the `getFillEventHistory` method is primarily used to retrieve event history data related to autofill services. The method's implementation involves checking the calling user ID, peeking at the service for the user, and sending the event history data to the result receiver.

The similar APIs provided, such as `getUserDataId`, `getAvailableFieldClassificationAlgorithms`, `getUserData`, `getAutofillServiceComponentName`, and `finishSession`, all have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs are also related to autofill services and do not seem to require any specific access control restrictions.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getFillEventHistory` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getFillEventHistory` method does not require any special access control restrictions either. The method's primary purpose is to retrieve data, which is generally considered a less sensitive operation compared to modifying data.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the method's implementation, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getFillEventHistory` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
