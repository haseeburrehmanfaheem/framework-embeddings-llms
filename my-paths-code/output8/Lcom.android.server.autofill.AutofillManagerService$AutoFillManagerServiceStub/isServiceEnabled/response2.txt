To determine the access control level for the `isServiceEnabled` method in the `AutofillManagerService$AutoFillManagerServiceStub` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `isServiceEnabled` method has three paths with different depths, but they all seem to be related to checking if a specific service is enabled for a given user. The method takes an integer `p1` (likely a user ID), a string `p2` (possibly a package name or service identifier), and an `IResultReceiver` object `p3` to send the result back.

The sink code entries provided show interactions with `AbstractPerUserSystemService`, which suggests that this method is working within the context of services managed per user. The critical parts of the code involve getting the service package name for a given user and comparing it with the provided string `p2`, then sending the result (a boolean indicating whether the service is enabled) back through the `IResultReceiver`.

Given the similar APIs and their access control levels:

1. **getAutofillServiceComponentName**: NONE
2. **getServiceSettingsActivity**: NONE
3. **getUserData**: NONE
4. **cancelSession**: NONE
5. **getServiceComponentName**: NONE

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require specific permissions or restrictions to be called. This suggests that the operations involved in these methods, such as retrieving service component names, user data, or canceling sessions, are considered safe and do not pose significant security risks.

Considering the nature of the `isServiceEnabled` method, which is essentially a getter method providing information about whether a specific service is enabled for a user, it aligns with the principle that reading data (in this case, the status of a service) is generally less sensitive than modifying it. Since all similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`, and given that the `isServiceEnabled` method does not seem to pose any significant security risk by merely reporting the status of a service, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the nature of the `isServiceEnabled` method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
