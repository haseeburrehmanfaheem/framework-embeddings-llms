To determine the access control level for the `finishSession` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `finishSession` API has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path involves multiple operations, including checking if the Autofill manager is enabled, getting the session object, and performing various actions based on the session state.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path also checks if the Autofill manager is enabled and gets the session object. However, it performs different actions, such as showing the save UI and logging context committed.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path simply returns if the `Helper.sVerbose` flag is not set.

The sink code provided shows that the API interacts with sensitive components, including `AbstractPerUserSystemService` and `IAutoFillManager$Stub`.

Comparing the `finishSession` API with the similar APIs (`cancelSession(II)V`), we can see that they share similarities in their code structure and interactions with sensitive components. The `cancelSession` APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require special permissions to execute.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the `finishSession` API performs more complex operations, such as destroying sessions and removing them from services. These actions may require additional permissions or access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications to the system state.

Considering the similarities with the `cancelSession` APIs and the potential risks associated with the `finishSession` API's actions, we can conclude that the access control level for the `finishSession` API should be higher than `NONE`.

Given the options, we assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `finishSession` API. This level indicates that the API requires some permissions or access controls but does not pose a significant risk to the system.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment reflects the API's moderate complexity and potential impact on the system, while also considering its similarities with other APIs in the same domain.
