To identify potential sinks in the provided API paths for `onPendingSaveUi`, we need to analyze each path based on the given rules and criteria. 

### Path 1 Analysis
In Path 1, several operations are performed:
- The method checks if `p1` equals 1 and not equal to 2, which is logically impossible since a variable cannot be both equal to 1 and not equal to 1 at the same time. This suggests that this path might not be executed as intended due to this logical inconsistency.
- It creates new objects (`Object v2 = new Object(1);`, `Integer v3 = Integer.valueOf(p1);`), but these do not directly contribute to a sink based on the provided rules since they are not returned by the API or used in conjunction with other potential sinks.
- The method invokes `Preconditions.checkArgument(0, "invalid operation: %d", v2);`, which could be considered a utility method and thus might not qualify as a sink under the negative rules.
- It accesses fields (`this.mSessions.size()`, `this.mSessions.valueAt((v18 + -1))`) and performs operations on them. However, these do not directly follow the positive rules for field access since they are not returned by the API or used in conjunction with other potential sinks based on naming similarity.
- The method calls `Session.isSaveUiPendingLocked()` and checks its return value, but this does not directly contribute to a sink under the given rules without further context on how it's related to the API's parameters or return values.

### Path 2 Analysis
In Path 2:
- Similar to Path 1, there are logical inconsistencies in the conditions (`if (p1 == 1) { if (p1 != 2) {`), suggesting this path might not be executed as intended.
- It creates objects and performs checks similar to Path 1 but does not directly contribute to a sink based on the provided rules.
- The method calls `v19.isSaveUiPendingForTokenLocked(p2);`, which involves one of the API's parameters (`p2`). However, without further context on how this operation affects the state or output of the API, it's challenging to classify it as a sink under the given rules.

### Path 3 Analysis
In Path 3:
- The method checks if `p1` equals 1 and not equal to 2, which again presents a logical inconsistency.
- It accesses fields and performs operations (`AutofillManagerService.access$5100(this.this$0);`, `UserHandle.getCallingUserId();`, `AutofillManagerService.access$5200(this.this$0, v6);`), but these do not directly follow the positive rules for field access or method invocation as potential sinks.
- The method invokes `v7.onPendingSaveUi(p1, p2);`, which involves both API parameters (`p1` and `p2`). This could be considered a sink since it propagates the API's input parameters to another method invocation.

Given these analyses, identifying clear sinks based on the provided rules is challenging due to logical inconsistencies in the conditions and the lack of direct data flow from the API's parameters to returned values or created objects that are used as sinks. However, for the sake of following the instructions and considering all possible interpretations:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object v1 = Objects.requireNonNull(p2, \"token\");",
      "if (p1 == 1) { if (p1 != 2) {",
      "v7.onPendingSaveUi(p1, p2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This JSON represents a potential sink set across the paths where `p1` and `p2` are processed within method invocations. However, please note that due to the logical inconsistencies and the nature of the provided code, this analysis might not fully align with the expected outcomes based on standard programming practices.
