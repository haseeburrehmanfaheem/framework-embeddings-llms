Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getUserData` method.

The `getUserData` method is used to retrieve user data, which may contain sensitive information. However, the method does not modify any data, it only reads and returns the existing data.

All the similar APIs provided have an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that they do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access the data. These APIs are also used to retrieve various types of data, such as service component names, service enabled status, field classification enabled status, fill event history, and session restoration.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `getUserData` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getUserData` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getUserData` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and the similar APIs provided do not require any specific permissions or restrictions to access the data.
