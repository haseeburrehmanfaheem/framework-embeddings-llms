To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayActivated` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The most similar APIs in terms of functionality and context are `isReduceBrightColorsActivated()`, `isNightDisplayActivated()`, and `getNightDisplayColorTemperature()`, all of which have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods are related to reading or getting the status of display settings, which generally requires less restriction.
   - On the other hand, `setAccountVisibility` and `setNightDisplayAutoMode` have a higher access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods involve setting or modifying account visibility and night display auto-mode, respectively, which can be considered more sensitive operations.

2. **Setter vs. Getter Methods**:
   - It's mentioned that if a setter method requires access control, the related getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction. However, for `setNightDisplayActivated`, we are looking at setting a display property, which is somewhat similar to the more sensitive operations but directly pertains to display settings rather than account or user data.
   - The getter methods (`isNightDisplayActivated`, `getNightDisplayColorTemperature`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that reading these settings is not considered sensitive.

3. **Semantics and Sinks**:
   - The sink code for `setNightDisplayActivated` involves setting the activated state of the night display tint controller based on the input boolean value. This operation directly affects the device's display settings.
   - While this does modify a system setting, it's more related to the device's visual output rather than sensitive user data or system security.

4. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given that `setNightDisplayActivated` modifies a display setting and considering the principle that writing data usually poses a greater security risk than reading it, we might initially lean towards a higher access control level.
   - However, the nature of this modification is related to display settings, which are not typically as sensitive as account or personal data. The similar APIs provided suggest a mix of access levels, but those directly related to display settings (both getters) have `NONE`.
   - Considering the specific context and the fact that setting display properties like night mode activation is a common user-adjustable setting, it seems reasonable to conclude that this operation, while potentially needing some level of control, does not rise to the level of sensitivity as those requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` access.

Based on these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `setNightDisplayActivated` would be `NORMAL`. This reflects a balance between the need for some level of access control due to the method's ability to modify system settings and the relatively less sensitive nature of display settings compared to other system or user data.
