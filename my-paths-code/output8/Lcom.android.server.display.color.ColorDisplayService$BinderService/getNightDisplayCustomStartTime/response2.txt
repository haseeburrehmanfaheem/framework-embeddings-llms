To determine the access control level for the `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method, we should consider the similarities and differences with the provided APIs, their access control levels, and the semantics of the methods.

1. **Similarity with `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime`**: This method has a similarity score ranging from 0.814 to 0.841, which is relatively high. It also deals with retrieving a custom end time for night display, which is closely related to the start time. Notably, `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that reading this type of information is not considered sensitive.

2. **Comparison with `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` and `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`**: Both of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that setting custom start or end times for night display is considered a sensitive operation that requires higher privileges. However, as noted in the guidelines, if a setter method requires a certain level of access control, the corresponding getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.

3. **Semantics and Security Considerations**: The `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method retrieves a setting that controls when night display starts. This information is related to device settings rather than user-sensitive data (like location, contacts, etc.). Given the nature of this data, it's reasonable to consider that accessing this information does not pose a significant security risk.

4. **Other Similar APIs**: Other APIs like `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` and `createSession` have access control levels of `NONE`, further suggesting that operations related to retrieving settings or creating sessions for TV inputs do not require elevated permissions.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` seems to be `NONE`. This is because the method retrieves non-sensitive information (device setting), and there's precedent with similar APIs (`getNightDisplayCustomEndTime`, `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw`) having the same access control level. Additionally, the principle that getter methods generally require less restriction than their corresponding setter methods supports this conclusion.
