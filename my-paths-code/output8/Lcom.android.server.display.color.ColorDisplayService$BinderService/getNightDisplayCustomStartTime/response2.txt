To determine the access control level for the `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, all of which involve clearing and restoring the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)`. This suggests that the method is accessing or modifying sensitive data that requires permission checks.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with secure settings (`Settings$Secure.getIntForUser`) and time calculations, which are not inherently dangerous but do involve system-level data access.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided: `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` with a similarity score of 0.9536327123641968 and 0.9339390993118286, both having an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 
   - These APIs also involve clearing and restoring the calling identity, indicating they deal with system-level or signature-protected data.

Given this information:

- The method interacts with system settings (`Settings$Secure.getIntForUser`) which typically requires some form of permission.
- It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v1)`, suggesting it's dealing with data that needs protection against unauthorized access, but not necessarily dangerous operations like sending SMS or making calls.
- The similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system-level permissions or signature verification to execute.

Considering these points, the method seems to be accessing system-level data in a way that requires protection but does not perform inherently dangerous actions. Therefore, it should have an access control level that reflects its need for system or signature-level permission without being classified as dangerous.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice aligns with the similar APIs provided and acknowledges the method's interaction with secure settings and system-level data.
