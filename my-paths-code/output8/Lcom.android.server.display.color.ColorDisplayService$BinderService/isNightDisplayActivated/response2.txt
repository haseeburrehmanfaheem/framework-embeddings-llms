To determine the access control level for the `isNightDisplayActivated` method, we need to consider the similarities and differences with the provided APIs, as well as the general principles of access control in Android.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The `isNightDisplayActivated` method has similarities with other methods like `setNightDisplayActivated`, `isReduceBrightColorsActivated`, `getNightDisplayColorTemperature`, `isSaturationActivated`, and `getNightDisplayAutoMode`. Among these, `setNightDisplayActivated`, `isSaturationActivated`, and `getNightDisplayAutoMode` have a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`), indicating they are sensitive operations. However, `isReduceBrightColorsActivated` and `getNightDisplayColorTemperature` have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that reading certain display settings is not considered sensitive.

2. **Semantics of the Method**: The method in question, `isNightDisplayActivated`, is a getter method that returns the status of night display activation. Generally, reading data (in this case, the status of a display setting) is less sensitive than writing or modifying data.

3. **Access Control Principle**: If a setter method requires a high level of access control, it does not necessarily mean the corresponding getter method needs the same level of restriction. However, if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level.

Given these considerations:

- The `setNightDisplayActivated` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that modifying the night display setting is sensitive.
- The method in question, `isNightDisplayActivated`, only reads the status and does not modify it. Reading such a setting is generally less sensitive than changing it.

However, considering the similarities with other methods that have higher access control levels (`SYS_OR_SIG`) for both reading and writing operations related to display settings, and given that this method deals with a specific display setting (night display), it might still require some level of protection. Yet, based on the principle that reading data is less sensitive than writing it, and considering examples like `isReduceBrightColorsActivated` which has an access control level of `NONE`, we can infer that not all display settings readings are highly restricted.

Therefore, given the provided information and following the general principles of access control in Android, the most appropriate access control level for the `isNightDisplayActivated` method would be `NORMAL`. This reflects a balance between security considerations and the relatively lower sensitivity of reading display settings compared to modifying them.
