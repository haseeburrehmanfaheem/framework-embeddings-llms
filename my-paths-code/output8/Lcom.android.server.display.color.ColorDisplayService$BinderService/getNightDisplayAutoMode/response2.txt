Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getNightDisplayAutoMode` API.

The `getNightDisplayAutoMode` API is a getter method that retrieves the night display auto mode. The similar APIs provided are also getter methods, and most of them have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that reading data related to display settings is not considered sensitive.

However, it's essential to consider the corresponding setter method, `setNightDisplayAutoMode`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. According to the principle mentioned earlier, if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level. In this case, since the setter method requires a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`), it's likely that the getter method can have a lower access control level.

Given the similarities between the `getNightDisplayAutoMode` API and other getter methods in the same class, which have an access control level of `NONE`, I will assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `getNightDisplayAutoMode` API.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that reading data related to display settings is not considered sensitive, and the similar APIs provided also have an access control level of `NONE`. Additionally, since the corresponding setter method requires a higher access control level, it's likely that the getter method can have a lower access control level.
