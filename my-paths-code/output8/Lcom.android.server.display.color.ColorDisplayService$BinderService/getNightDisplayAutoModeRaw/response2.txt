To determine the access control level for the `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `getNightDisplayAutoMode()`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `setNightDisplayAutoMode(I)Z`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `getColorMode()I`: NONE
   - `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()Landroid/hardware/display/Time;`: NONE
   - `setNightDisplayColorTemperature(I)Z`: SYS_OR_SIG

2. **Observations**:
   - The method in question, `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw`, is a getter method that retrieves the night display auto mode raw value.
   - It interacts with system settings (specifically, "night_display_auto_mode") which suggests it deals with sensitive or system-level data.
   - Similar APIs like `getNightDisplayAutoMode()` and `setNightDisplayAutoMode(I)Z` have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating they require system or signature-level permission to access or modify the night display auto mode settings.
   - Other getter methods like `getColorMode()I` and `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()Landroid/hardware/display/Time;` have NONE as their access control level, suggesting less restrictive access for reading certain types of display settings.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, setter methods require higher access control levels than getter methods because writing data can pose a greater security risk than reading it.
   - However, if a getter method is protected (not NONE), the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given that `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` deals with system settings and similar methods (`getNightDisplayAutoMode()` and `setNightDisplayAutoMode(I)Z`) have a SYS_OR_SIG access control level, it is reasonable to conclude that `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` should also be protected at a significant level. However, considering the principle that getter methods typically require less restrictive access than setter methods, and acknowledging that reading display settings might not pose as significant a risk as modifying them, we must weigh these factors.

   Since `getNightDisplayAutoMode()` has SYS_OR_SIG and it's closely related to the method in question, and given that this method also interacts with system settings (albeit for reading), assigning an access control level of NONE seems too permissive considering the context. However, without explicit justification for a DANGEROUS or NORMAL level based on the provided similarities and principles, and recognizing that SYS_OR_SIG is typically reserved for operations requiring system or signature-level permissions which might be more aligned with setting rather than getting display modes, we must consider what's appropriate for a getter method in this context.

   Given these considerations and the fact that similar APIs (especially those directly related to night display settings) are secured at the SYS_OR_SIG level, it suggests that even reading certain system settings could require significant permission levels. Thus, leaning towards caution and considering the specific interactions with system settings, an informed decision would be to align `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw` with a similar level of protection as its closely related counterparts.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
