Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control levels of similar APIs to determine the appropriate level for the `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method.

The `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` and `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require a system or signature-level permission to modify the night display custom end time and start time, respectively. This suggests that writing data related to night display settings poses a security risk and requires elevated permissions.

On the other hand, the `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that reading the night display custom start time does not pose a significant security risk.

Considering the principle that if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level, we can infer that the `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method should have a lower or equal access control level compared to its corresponding setter method (`setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`).

Given that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and considering the similarities between the `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` and `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` methods, we can conclude that the `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method should have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
