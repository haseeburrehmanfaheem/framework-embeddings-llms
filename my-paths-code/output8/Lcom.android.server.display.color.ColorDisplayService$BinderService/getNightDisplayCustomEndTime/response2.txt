To determine the access control level for the `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path retrieves the custom end time from the settings database using `Settings$Secure.getIntForUser`. It then creates a `Time` object based on the retrieved value.
2. Path 2 (depth 1) and Path 3 (depth 0): These paths call internal methods (`getNightDisplayCustomEndTimeInternal` or `ColorDisplayService.-$$Nest$mgetNightDisplayCustomEndTimeInternal`) to retrieve the custom end time.

The similar APIs provided are:

* `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`: This method sets the custom end time and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It writes to the settings database using `Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`.
* `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime`: This method retrieves the custom start time and has an access control level of `NONE`. It calls an internal method (`getNightDisplayCustomStartTimeInternal`) to retrieve the custom start time.

Comparing the code paths and similar APIs, we can observe that:

* The `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method does not modify any sensitive data or perform any actions that require elevated privileges.
* The method only retrieves data from the settings database or calls internal methods to retrieve the custom end time.
* The similar API `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that retrieving custom times does not require special permissions.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method does not require any special permissions or elevated privileges to operate. Therefore, the access control level for this method should be `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
