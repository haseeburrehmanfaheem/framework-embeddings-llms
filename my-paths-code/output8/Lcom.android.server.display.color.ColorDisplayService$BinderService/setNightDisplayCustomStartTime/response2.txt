To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method modifies a secure setting (`"night_display_custom_start_time"`) using `Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`. This operation involves writing to a secure settings area, which typically requires careful consideration of access control.

2. **Sink Code**: The sinks involve getting a local time from the input `Time` object and then converting it into seconds of the day, followed by storing this value in secure settings. Another sink directly calls an internal method (`setNightDisplayCustomStartTimeInternal`) to perform the setting update.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method reads a custom start time from secure settings, which is considered less sensitive than writing to these settings.
   - `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime()` also has an access control level of `NONE`, similar in nature to `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()`, reading instead of writing.

Given the above points:

- Writing to secure settings (as seen in `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime`) generally requires more stringent access control compared to reading from these settings.
- The method involves modifying system settings that could potentially affect how the device operates, specifically related to display and power management during certain times of the day.
- Despite similar APIs (`getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` and `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime`) having an access control level of `NONE`, they are read operations which inherently pose less risk than write operations.

Considering these factors, assigning an access control level of `NORMAL` seems reasonable. This is because while the operation does modify system settings, it's a specific, controlled modification (setting night display custom start time) that doesn't directly imply a significant or dangerous level of access (like accessing sensitive user data or performing actions that could immediately compromise the device's security or stability). However, since this involves modifying secure settings which is more sensitive than just reading from them, `NONE` might be too permissive.

Therefore, given the choices and considering standard practices for securing such operations without over-restricting legitimate usage:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice balances the need to protect system settings with the practical requirement of allowing authorized modifications to these settings.
