Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method.

The `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method is used to set the custom start time for night display. The method writes data to the settings secure table, which can potentially affect the system's behavior. 

Similar APIs such as `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`, `setNightDisplayAutoMode`, and `setNightDisplayColorTemperature` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also write data to the settings secure table or affect the system's behavior.

On the other hand, getter methods like `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` and `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime` have an access control level of `NONE`, which is expected since reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.

Considering these factors, I will assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime` method. This is because writing data to the settings secure table can potentially affect the system's behavior and should be restricted to system or signature-level access.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
