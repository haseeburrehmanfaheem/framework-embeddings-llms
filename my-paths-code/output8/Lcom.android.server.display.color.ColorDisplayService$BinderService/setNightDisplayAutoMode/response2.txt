To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayAutoMode` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs. The method modifies the night display auto mode setting by writing to the "night_display_auto_mode" secure setting.

1. **Analysis of Similar APIs:**
   - `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw()` has an access control level of `NONE`, but this is a getter method, which generally requires less restriction than a setter method.
   - `setNightDisplayColorTemperature(I)Z`, `getNightDisplayAutoMode()I`, `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime(Landroid/hardware/display/Time;)Z`, and `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime(Landroid/hardware/display/Time;)Z` all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are either setters that modify display settings or getters that require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive information.

2. **Behavior of `setNightDisplayAutoMode`:**
   - The method writes to a secure setting ("night_display_auto_mode"), which suggests it could potentially impact the device's security or functionality.
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)`, indicating that it is designed to temporarily change the calling identity, likely for security or permission reasons.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Given that similar setter methods (`setNightDisplayColorTemperature`, `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime`, `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering that `setNightDisplayAutoMode` also modifies a secure setting, it's reasonable to infer that `setNightDisplayAutoMode` should have a similar or higher level of access control.
   - The fact that it writes to a secure setting suggests that the operation is not entirely benign and could potentially be used in a way that affects the device's security or user experience.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, `setNightDisplayAutoMode` should have an access control level that reflects its potential impact on device settings and security. Given the similarities with other methods that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that `setNightDisplayAutoMode` should also be assigned a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
