To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayAutoMode` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, all of which involve setting the night display auto mode through internal methods or directly interacting with settings. This includes writing to secure settings (`Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`) and checking the current auto mode (`ColorDisplayService.getNightDisplayAutoModeInternal`).

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code points involve getting and setting the night display auto mode internally and through secure settings.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getNightDisplayAutoModeRaw()`: This method reads a setting and has an access control level of `NONE`. It's similar in that it also deals with night display settings but is read-only.
   - `setNightDisplayColorTemperature(I)Z`: This method sets another aspect of the night display (color temperature) and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission.

Given these points, we can infer that setting the night display auto mode involves modifying system settings, which typically requires a certain level of permission to prevent unauthorized changes. The fact that `setNightDisplayColorTemperature` (a similar API) has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests that modifications to night display settings are considered sensitive and require higher-level permissions.

However, the exact nature of the permission required can depend on whether this setting is considered dangerous or if it's something that should be restricted to system or signature applications. Given that changing display settings like auto mode could potentially impact user experience but doesn't directly access sensitive data or perform dangerous operations (like sending SMS or making calls), it might not necessarily fall under `DANGEROUS`. Yet, considering the need for some level of restriction and the similarity with `SYS_OR_SIG` rated methods, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` seems reasonable. This ensures that only authorized applications can modify such settings.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the need for a moderate to high level of access control, given the method's interaction with system settings and its similarity to other methods that require system or signature-level permissions.
