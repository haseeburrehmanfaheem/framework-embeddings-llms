To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, all of which involve setting a custom end time for night display using the `Settings$Secure.putIntForUser` method or calling an internal method (`setNightDisplayCustomEndTimeInternal`) that presumably does something similar.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with system settings and content resolvers, indicating that this method affects system-level settings.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` has a high similarity score and is assigned an access control level of `NONE`. This API retrieves the custom start time for night display, which is a read operation.
   - The key difference between these similar APIs and `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` is that `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` modifies system settings (a write operation), whereas `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime` only reads them.

Given this analysis:

- **Write Operations to System Settings**: Typically, methods that modify system settings are considered more sensitive than those that simply read from them. This sensitivity often warrants a higher access control level because modifying system settings can have broader implications on the device's behavior and security.
  
- **Comparison with Similar APIs**: The similar APIs provided (`getNightDisplayCustomStartTime`) are read-only and have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating they are not considered sensitive in terms of access control. However, since `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` involves writing to system settings, it should be treated with more caution.

- **Access Control Levels**:
  - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not affect security or privacy.
  - `NORMAL`: For methods that have some impact but are generally not dangerous.
  - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can cause harm if misused, such as those that access sensitive data or modify system settings in significant ways.
  - `SYS_OR_SIG`: For operations that require system or signature-level permissions, often because they are highly privileged.

Considering the method modifies system settings related to night display and involves interactions that could potentially be sensitive (though not directly accessing user data), it seems reasonable to assign a moderate level of access control. However, since it does modify system settings, which can have security implications, the most appropriate choice would lean towards requiring some form of permission or access control.

Given the options provided:

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
