To determine the access control level for the `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` method, let's analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()` and `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime()` both have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that reading the custom start and end times does not pose a significant security risk.
   - `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime()`, `resumeWifiDisplay()`, and `setNightDisplayAutoMode()` all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that setting or modifying display-related settings is considered sensitive and requires a higher level of access control.

2. **Setter vs. Getter Methods**:
   - Generally, setter methods are considered more sensitive than getter methods because they can modify system settings, which might have security implications.
   - The fact that `getNightDisplayCustomStartTime()` and `getNightDisplayCustomEndTime()` have an access control level of `NONE` suggests that reading these values is not restricted. However, since `setNightDisplayCustomStartTime()` has a higher access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`), it implies that modifying these settings (like setting the custom end time) should also be restricted to prevent unauthorized changes.

3. **Code Semantics and Sinks**:
   - The code for `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` involves writing to secure settings (`Settings$Secure.putIntForUser`) which is a sensitive operation, similar to other methods classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` suggests that the method is careful about handling caller identity, which is important for security but does not directly imply a specific access control level.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `setNightDisplayCustomEndTime` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it involves modifying system settings related to display, similar to other methods that have been classified with this level of access control. This ensures that only system or signature applications can modify these sensitive settings, aligning with Android's security principles.
