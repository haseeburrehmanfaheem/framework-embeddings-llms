To determine the access control level for the `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Method Semantics**: The method returns an integer value representing the strength of reducing bright colors. This operation is a read-only action, as it does not modify any system settings but merely retrieves a current state.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `getNightDisplayColorTemperature()`: This method has a similarity score of 0.791139543056488 and an access control level of NONE. It also reads a setting (color temperature) without modifying it.
   - `getColorMode()`: With similarity scores of 0.7250666618347168 and 0.705926239490509, this method has an access control level of NONE. It reads the current color mode, which is another read-only operation related to display settings.
   - `getPhysicalAddress()`: Although it has a moderate similarity score (0.7181016206741333), its access control level is SYS_OR_SIG, indicating it requires higher security clearance due to the sensitive nature of physical address information.
   - `getLockTaskModeState()`: With a similarity score of 0.7086853384971619 and an access control level of NONE, this method reads the state of lock task mode, which is another example of a read-only operation.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Reading data (getter methods) generally requires less stringent access control than writing data (setter methods), unless the data itself is sensitive.
   - The principle that if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should have an equal or higher level of access control does not directly apply here since we're evaluating the access control for a getter method.

Given these considerations:

- The `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` method is primarily a read operation, retrieving the current strength setting without modifying it.
- Similar APIs that are also read operations and deal with display settings have an access control level of NONE, suggesting that reading such settings is not considered sensitive enough to require higher access control levels.
- There's no indication that the information returned by `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` is particularly sensitive or could be used in a manner that would compromise system security or user privacy.

**Conclusion**: Based on the method's semantics and the analysis of similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getReduceBrightColorsStrength` is NONE, as it aligns with other read-only operations related to display settings that do not pose significant security risks.
