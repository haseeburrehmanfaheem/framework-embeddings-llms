To determine the access control level for the `requestNothing` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs.

The `requestNothing` API has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path involves reading data from a byte array, creating a `CheckToken` object, and writing events to the event log.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path involves creating a `CheckToken` object from a byte array and writing events to the event log.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path involves creating a `CheckToken` object using `RulesManagerService.createCheckTokenOrThrow`, recording a check result, and writing events to the event log.

All three paths involve creating a `CheckToken` object and performing some operations with it. The sink code snippets also indicate that the creation of `CheckToken` objects is a critical part of the API's functionality.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `requestInstall(Landroid/os/ParcelFileDescriptor;[BLandroid/app/timezone/ICallback;)I` (Similarity Score: 0.7820372581481934 and 0.7737163305282593): Both of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. They also involve creating a `CheckToken` object using `RulesManagerService.createCheckTokenOrThrow` or by constructing it manually.

Given the similarities in functionality, particularly the creation and use of `CheckToken` objects, and considering that the similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, it suggests that the `requestNothing` API does not require a higher level of access control than `NONE`.

However, it's crucial to note that the `requestNothing` API does enforce a permission check at the beginning of its execution paths using `this.mPermissionHelper.enforceCallerHasPermission("android.permission.UPDATE_TIME_ZONE_RULES");`. This implies that despite the similarities with APIs labeled as `NONE`, the actual access control level should reflect the need for this specific permission.

Given the enforced permission and comparing with the provided similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level seems to be `NORMAL`, as it reflects the need for a specific permission without elevating to `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` levels which are typically reserved for more sensitive operations or system/service signature permissions, respectively.

Therefore, considering the permission check and the nature of the API's operations:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision balances the need to protect the API with the appropriate level of access control based on its functionality and the enforced permission check.
