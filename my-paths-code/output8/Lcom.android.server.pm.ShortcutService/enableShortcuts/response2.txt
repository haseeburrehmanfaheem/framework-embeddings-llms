Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `enableShortcuts` method.

The reasoning behind this decision is as follows:

* The `enableShortcuts` method interacts with sensitive data, such as package shortcuts and user IDs, which requires a certain level of access control.
* The similar APIs provided, such as `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`, `removeDynamicShortcuts`, `disableShortcuts`, `getShortcuts`, and `removeLongLivedShortcuts`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* These similar APIs also interact with sensitive data and perform operations that require a certain level of access control, such as removing or disabling shortcuts, getting shortcuts, or deleting long-lived shortcuts.
* The sink code entries provided for the `enableShortcuts` method show interactions with package managers, user IDs, and shortcut packages, which are similar to the interactions in the similar APIs.
* Given the similarities between the `enableShortcuts` method and the other APIs, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to ensure that the method is properly secured.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
