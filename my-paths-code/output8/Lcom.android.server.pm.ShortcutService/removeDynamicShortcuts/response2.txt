Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I would assign an access control level to the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API.

The `removeDynamicShortcuts` API has a high similarity with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs include `enableShortcuts`, `disableShortcuts`, `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`, `getShortcuts`, and `pushDynamicShortcut`.

The sink code entries for these similar APIs also involve interactions with the package manager, shortcut users, and shortcut packages, which are similar to the operations performed by the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API.

Given this information, I conclude that the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is similar in functionality and scope to other APIs with this access control level.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API has a consistent access control level with similar APIs, which helps maintain the security and integrity of the system.
