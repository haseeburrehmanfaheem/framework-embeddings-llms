Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeDynamicShortcuts` method has three paths with different depths, and it interacts with various sinks, including `ShortcutService.injectClearCallingIdentity()`, `this.mIPackageManager.getPackageUid(p1, 795136, p3)`, `ShortcutUser`, and `ShortcutPackage`. The method also checks for ephemeral apps, user unlocking status, and performs operations on shortcuts.

The similar APIs, `enableShortcuts` and `disableShortcuts`, have a high similarity score with `removeDynamicShortcuts` and share similar code patterns, including interactions with `ShortcutService`, `ShortcutUser`, and `ShortcutPackage`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering the similarities in code patterns and interactions with sinks, I conclude that the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method should have a similar access control level to its similar APIs.

The final access control level for the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarities in code patterns, interactions with sinks, and the access control levels of the similar APIs. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level indicates that the method requires a system or signature-level permission to execute, which is consistent with the permissions required by the similar APIs.
