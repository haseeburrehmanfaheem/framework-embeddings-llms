Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level to the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method.

The method interacts with package shortcuts, user shortcuts, and performs operations such as deleting dynamic shortcuts. The similar APIs provided also interact with these entities and have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method requires a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications to package shortcuts.

Considering the similarities in code and functionality between the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method and the provided APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method. This is because the method modifies package shortcuts, which is a sensitive operation that requires system or signature-level permission to prevent unauthorized changes.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that only authorized system or signature-level components can call this method and modify package shortcuts, maintaining the security and integrity of the shortcut management system.
