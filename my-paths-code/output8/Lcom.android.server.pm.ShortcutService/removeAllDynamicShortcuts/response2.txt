Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method interacts with the package manager and shortcut services, which are sensitive operations. The method also checks for ephemeral apps, user unlocking status, and performs various shortcut-related operations.

The similar APIs, `enableShortcuts` and `getShortcuts`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs also interact with the package manager and shortcut services, similar to `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`.

Considering the similarities in functionality and the sensitive nature of the operations performed by `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`, I conclude that it should have a similar access control level to its similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level privileged entities can call this method, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive shortcut management operations.
