Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` API.

The similar APIs all have a high similarity score (above 0.8) and are all assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This suggests that the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` API is likely to require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the sink code for the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` API involves modifying shortcut data, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper authorization. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level is typically used for system or signature-protected APIs, which implies that only authorized system components or apps with the necessary signature can call this API.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the sensitive nature of the operation, I assign the following access control level to the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` API:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only authorized system components or apps with the necessary signature can call the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` API, protecting the sensitive shortcut data from unauthorized modifications.
