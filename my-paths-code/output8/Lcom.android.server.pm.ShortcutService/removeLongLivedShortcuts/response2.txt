Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them ultimately lead to the same sink code:
```java
v4 = p0.getPackageShortcutsForPublisherLocked(p1, p3);
v4.ensureImmutableShortcutsNotIncludedWithIds(p2, 1);
Object v7 = p2.get((v6 - 1));
CharSequence v8 = Preconditions.checkStringNotEmpty(v7);
boolean v9 = v4.isShortcutExistsAndVisibleToPublisher(v8);
ShortcutInfo v10 = v4.deleteLongLivedWithId(v8, 1);
```
This code is responsible for removing long-lived shortcuts from a package.

The similar APIs, `enableShortcuts` and `disableShortcuts`, have a similarity score of 0.9117621183395386 and 0.9048797488212585, respectively, which indicates that they are closely related to the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the fact that they all interact with package shortcuts, I conclude that the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because removing long-lived shortcuts is a sensitive operation that requires proper authorization and verification, which is consistent with the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `removeLongLivedShortcuts` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
