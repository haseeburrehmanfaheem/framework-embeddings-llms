Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `disableShortcuts` method.

The `disableShortcuts` method is part of the `ShortcutService` class, which handles shortcut-related operations. The method takes a package name, a list of shortcut IDs, a disabled message, and user ID as parameters.

Analyzing the provided sink code entries for the `disableShortcuts` method, we can see that it involves:

1. Verifying the caller's identity using `verifyCaller`.
2. Checking if the user is locked using `throwIfUserLockedL`.
3. Getting package shortcuts for the publisher using `getPackageShortcutsForPublisherLocked`.
4. Ensuring immutable shortcuts are not included with IDs using `ensureImmutableShortcutsNotIncludedWithIds`.

The similar APIs provided, such as `reportShortcutUsed`, `enableShortcuts`, `removeDynamicShortcuts`, `removeLongLivedShortcuts`, and `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods are also part of the `ShortcutService` class and perform various shortcut-related operations.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `disableShortcuts` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `disableShortcuts` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `disableShortcuts` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permission to be invoked, ensuring that only authorized components can disable shortcuts.
