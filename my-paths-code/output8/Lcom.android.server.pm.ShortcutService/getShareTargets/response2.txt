To determine the access control level for the `getShareTargets` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `getShareTargets` method has three paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path checks if the user is unlocked or unlocking and performs various operations related to shortcut services.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path also checks if the user is unlocked or unlocking and performs similar operations as Path 1.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path throws an exception if the user is locked and then retrieves the user's shortcuts.

The sink code for `getShareTargets` involves checking user unlock status, loading user shortcuts, and creating a `ParceledListSlice`.

Comparing this with similar APIs:

* `resetThrottling()` has a similarity score of 0.832898736000061 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also interacts with user unlock status and shortcut services.
* `hasShareTargets()` has a similarity score of 0.8126230239868164 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method checks user unlock status, loads user shortcuts, and performs operations related to share targets.

Based on the similarities in code and functionality, it appears that `getShareTargets` requires a similar access control level as `resetThrottling()` and `hasShareTargets()`, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getShareTargets` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
