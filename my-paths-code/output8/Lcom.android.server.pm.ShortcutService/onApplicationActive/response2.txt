To determine the access control level for the `onApplicationActive` method in the `ShortcutService` class, we need to analyze its interactions with sensitive data and operations, as well as compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Interactions with Sensitive Data and Operations**: The `onApplicationActive` method interacts with shortcut packages and user shortcuts, which are sensitive in terms of user privacy and application functionality. It performs operations like resetting rate limiting for command-line shortcuts, saving user data, and cleaning up dangling bitmap directories. These operations suggest that the method has access to potentially sensitive information and can modify system or user data.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **enableShortcuts**: This API has a similarity score ranging from 0.8316 to 0.8499 with `onApplicationActive`. It is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires either system or signature-level permission.
   - **hasShareTargets**: With a similarity score of 0.8449, this API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - **removeAllDynamicShortcuts**: Similarity scores range from 0.8128 to 0.8297, and it is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.
   - **reportShortcutUsed**: Although the similarity score (0.7789) is slightly lower, its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - **getMaxShortcutCountPerActivity**: This API has a lower similarity score of 0.7665 but still requires `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.

Given these comparisons and considering that all similar APIs with significant interactions with shortcut data and operations require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it's reasonable to infer that the `onApplicationActive` method should also be assigned a similar level of access control due to its potential impact on system and user data.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the method's functionality, its interaction with sensitive data, and the access control levels of similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `onApplicationActive` method in the `ShortcutService` class is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
