To determine the access control level for the `onApplicationActive` method, we need to analyze its interactions with sensitive data or operations and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Interactions with Sensitive Data or Operations**: The `onApplicationActive` method interacts with user shortcut data, package shortcuts, and performs file operations (reading and writing). It also logs metrics and resets rate limiting for command-line shortcuts. These interactions suggest that the method deals with potentially sensitive user data and system resources.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The `enableShortcuts` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method interacts with package shortcuts, ensuring immutable shortcuts are not included, which implies a need for system or signature-level permission to modify shortcut configurations.
   - The `hasShareTargets` API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It checks if a package has share targets, indicating that accessing and determining the presence of share targets requires system or signature-level permissions.

Given these comparisons, we can infer that operations related to shortcuts, especially those involving modifications or accesses to sensitive user data (like shortcut configurations), require elevated permissions. The `onApplicationActive` method's interactions with user shortcuts, package shortcuts, and its ability to reset rate limiting and save user data suggest it requires a level of access control similar to the compared APIs.

**Access Control Level Determination**: Considering the method's functionality and the need for protection of user data and system resources, along with the comparisons to similar APIs that have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, we can conclude that the `onApplicationActive` method should also be assigned a similar level of access control. This is because it performs operations that are as sensitive or potentially impactful as those in the compared APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `onApplicationActive` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination ensures that the method's interactions with user and system data are protected at a level consistent with other similar operations within the system.
