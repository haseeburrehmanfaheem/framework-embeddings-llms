To determine the access control level for the `reportShortcutUsed` method, we need to analyze its interactions with sensitive sinks and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets for `reportShortcutUsed` show interactions with several components:
- `mIPackageManager.getPackageUid(p1, 795136, p3)`: This suggests an interaction with package management, which could be considered sensitive as it involves checking the UID of a package.
- `ShortcutService.getApplicationInfo(p1, p3)` and `ShortcutService.isEphemeralApp(v12)`: These involve getting application information and checking if an app is ephemeral, which are operations related to application management and security.
- `this.mUsageStatsManagerInternal.reportShortcutUsage(p1, p2, p3)`: Reporting shortcut usage involves interacting with user data and could be sensitive from a privacy perspective.

The similar APIs provided, `disableShortcuts` and `enableShortcuts`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with package shortcuts but are focused on enabling or disabling them rather than reporting their usage. The key aspect here is that they verify the caller (`p0.verifyCaller(p1, p5)`) before performing operations, indicating a need for signature or system-level permission to execute these actions.

Given this context, `reportShortcutUsed` also verifies the caller in its path 3 (`p0.verifyCaller(p1, p3)`) and interacts with sensitive components like package management and user data. However, it does not explicitly modify system settings or perform actions that would typically require `DANGEROUS` permissions (like accessing location, contacts, etc.). The operations are more related to reporting usage within the context of shortcuts, which is still a sensitive operation but seems to be managed within the scope of system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, considering the interactions with sensitive components and the comparison with similar APIs that have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that `reportShortcutUsed` should also have an access control level that reflects the need for either system or signature-level permission to ensure that only authorized entities can report shortcut usage.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the method's interactions with package management, application information, and user data, as well as its similarity in functionality and security requirements to other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.
