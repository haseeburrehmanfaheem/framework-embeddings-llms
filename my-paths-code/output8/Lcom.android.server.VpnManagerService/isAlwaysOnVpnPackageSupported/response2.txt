To determine the access control level for the `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs provided. The method checks if a package supports always-on VPN, which involves sensitive operations related to network security and user data.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Path 1 and Path 2 involve checking the existence of a VPN profile for a given package and verifying if the package has services that support always-on VPN. This includes interactions with `VpnProfileStore`, querying intent services, and checking service metadata.
   - Path 3 is simpler, logging a message about the absence of VPN configuration for a user.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `setAppExclusionList`: This method modifies the exclusion list for a VPN, which directly affects network security settings. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission.
   - `deleteVpnProfile`: Deleting a VPN profile impacts user data and security settings, hence its `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
   - `isCallerCurrentAlwaysOnVpnLockdownApp`: This method checks if the caller is the current always-on VPN lockdown app. Despite its simplicity, it's related to VPN lockdown, which is a sensitive feature, but it has an access control level of `NONE`.
   - `startVpnProfile` and `getLegacyVpnInfo`: Both methods are involved in starting or retrieving VPN profiles, which are critical for network security. They have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given the method's involvement with checking always-on VPN support for a package, it interacts with sensitive data and settings.
   - The similar APIs provided, especially those directly modifying or accessing VPN profiles/settings (`setAppExclusionList`, `deleteVpnProfile`, `startVpnProfile`), have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their impact on network security and user data.
   - However, the method in question, `isAlwaysOnVpnPackageSupported`, is a getter/checker method. It does not modify any settings but rather checks the capability of a package regarding always-on VPN.

Considering these points, while the method does deal with sensitive information related to VPN capabilities, its role is more about checking or verifying existing configurations rather than modifying them. Given the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing it, and comparing with the access control levels of similar APIs which are mostly `SYS_OR_SIG` for methods that modify settings, a method that only checks support might not require the highest level of restriction.

However, since this method still deals with VPN-related information which is security-sensitive, assigning it an access control level of `NONE` seems inappropriate. Between `NORMAL` and `DANGEROUS`, considering the context provided by similar APIs and the nature of the operation (checking support for a security feature), `NORMAL` might be more fitting as it suggests some level of protection or restriction without requiring system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision balances the need to protect sensitive information with the method's role in simply verifying package capabilities regarding always-on VPN support.
