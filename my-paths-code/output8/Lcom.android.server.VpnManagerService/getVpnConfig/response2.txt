To determine the access control level for the `getVpnConfig` method, we need to analyze its behavior and compare it with similar APIs provided. The method seems to retrieve a VPN configuration based on an input parameter `p1`. If `p1` does not correspond to a known VPN (i.e., `v2 == 0`), it returns the default VPN configuration (`this.mConfig`).

Given this context, let's evaluate the similar APIs and their access control levels:

1. **getLegacyVpnInfo**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permission to access legacy VPN information. The similarity with `getVpnConfig` is moderate (up to 0.7717), suggesting some operational parallels, but the specific requirements for accessing legacy VPN info versus current VPN config might differ.

2. **isCallerCurrentAlwaysOnVpnApp**, **getProvisionedVpnProfileState**, and **isCallerCurrentAlwaysOnVpnLockdownApp**: These methods all have an access control level of `NONE`, meaning they do not require specific permissions to be called. Their similarities with `getVpnConfig` are somewhat lower (ranging from 0.7328 to 0.7466), and their operational contexts (checking always-on VPN app status, getting provisioned VPN profile state, or checking lockdown VPN app status) differ from directly retrieving a VPN configuration.

3. **setAlwaysOnVpnPackage**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, similar to `getLegacyVpnInfo`. It's involved in setting the always-on VPN package, which implies modifying system settings and thus requires higher permission levels. The similarity with `getVpnConfig` is relatively lower (0.7216), but it operates within a related domain.

Considering these points:

- **getVpnConfig** is primarily a getter method that retrieves information without modifying system settings directly.
- The principle in Android access control suggests that if a setter method requires higher access control, the corresponding getter might not need the same level of restriction because reading data is generally less sensitive than writing it.
- Given the operational nature of **getVpnConfig** and comparing it with other methods, especially those that have `NONE` as their access control level and are involved in retrieving or checking states rather than setting them, it seems reasonable to assign a lower access control requirement to **getVpnConfig**.

However, considering the context of VPN configurations which can be sensitive, and looking at the access control levels of similar methods like **getLegacyVpnInfo** and **setAlwaysOnVpnPackage** that require `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions for either reading specific VPN information or setting VPN packages, it might suggest that even a getter method like **getVpnConfig** could potentially require some level of restriction to protect sensitive information.

Given the provided similarities and access control levels, and considering the principle that getters generally require less restrictive access control than setters but still may need protection for sensitive data, the most appropriate access control level for **getVpnConfig** seems to be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects a balance between protecting potentially sensitive VPN configuration information and recognizing that this method is primarily a getter and not as risky as a setter method.
