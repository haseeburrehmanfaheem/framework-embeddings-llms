To determine the access control level for the `getFanSpeeds` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths. Path 1 checks various conditions before calling `HardwarePropertiesManagerService.nativeGetFanSpeeds()`, while Path 2 directly calls this native method after enforcing hardware properties retrieval allowed for the given parameter `p1`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code is a call to `HardwarePropertiesManagerService.nativeGetFanSpeeds()`, which is common in both paths of the `getFanSpeeds` method and is similar to the operations performed by the similar APIs.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getDeviceTemperatures(Ljava/lang/String;II)[F` has a similarity score of 0.7404705286026001 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also interacts with hardware properties (device temperatures) and requires a similar level of access.
   - `getCpuUsages(Ljava/lang/String;)[Landroid/os/CpuUsageInfo;` has a similarity score of 0.7320422530174255 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API deals with CPU usages, which is another sensitive hardware property.

Given these points:

- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive hardware information.
- The `getFanSpeeds` method also deals with sensitive hardware information (fan speeds), which suggests it should have a comparable level of protection.
- Path 2 of the `getFanSpeeds` method explicitly enforces hardware properties retrieval allowed, further suggesting that accessing fan speeds is a privileged operation.

Therefore, considering the similarity in functionality and the need to protect access to hardware properties, the appropriate access control level for the `getFanSpeeds` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
