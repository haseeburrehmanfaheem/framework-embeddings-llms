To determine the access control level for the `getCpuUsages` method in the `Lcom.android.server.HardwarePropertiesManagerService` class, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The most similar API in terms of functionality and context seems to be `getDeviceTemperatures` within the same class (`Lcom.android.server.HardwarePropertiesManagerService`), with a similarity score of 0.7420501112937927. This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - Another similar API is `getFanSpeeds`, also in `Lcom.android.server.HardwarePropertiesManagerService`, with a slightly lower similarity score but still relevant, and it also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code for `getCpuUsages` involves calling `HardwarePropertiesManagerService.nativeGetCpuUsages()`, which suggests it's accessing hardware-level information.
   - The presence of `p0.enforceHardwarePropertiesRetrievalAllowed(p1);` in one of the paths indicates that there is a check for whether the retrieval of hardware properties is allowed, implying some level of access control or permission checking.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Generally, getter methods (which retrieve information) are considered less sensitive than setter methods (which modify information). However, if the information being retrieved is sensitive or related to system security, it may still require a higher level of access control.
   - The fact that similar APIs (`getDeviceTemperatures` and `getFanSpeeds`) within the same service have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests that retrieving hardware-related properties might be considered sensitive and thus restricted.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the similarity in functionality with other methods that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, and considering the method's involvement with potentially sensitive hardware information, it is reasonable to conclude that `getCpuUsages` should also have a similar access control level.
   - The presence of an enforcement check (`p0.enforceHardwarePropertiesRetrievalAllowed(p1);`) in one of the paths further supports the notion that this method's access should be controlled.

Therefore, based on the analysis and considering the principles of access control in Android, the `getCpuUsages` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
