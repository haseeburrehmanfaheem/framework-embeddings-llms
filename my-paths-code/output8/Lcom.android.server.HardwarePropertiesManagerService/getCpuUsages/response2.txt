To determine the access control level for the `getCpuUsages` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `getCpuUsages` method returns CPU usage information. It has two paths:
   - Path 1 involves conditional checks and potentially calls `nativeGetCpuUsages()` if certain conditions are met.
   - Path 2 directly calls `nativeGetCpuUsages()` after enforcing hardware properties retrieval allowed.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets involve retrieving CPU usage information (`nativeGetCpuUsages()`) and checking the current VR listener status (`isCurrentVrListener`). These operations suggest interaction with system-level resources or services that might require specific permissions or access levels.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`isTrusted`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are either signature-protected (requiring a specific permission to call) or restricted to system or signature applications.
   - These methods seem to deal with checking trusted status based on notification listener settings, which implies handling sensitive information that requires protection against unauthorized access.

Given these points:

- The `getCpuUsages` method interacts with system resources (`nativeGetCpuUsages()`) and involves checks that might imply security or privacy considerations (e.g., VR listener status).
- Similar APIs with high similarity scores are protected at the `SYS_OR_SIG` level, suggesting that operations involving sensitive system information or settings are restricted to either system applications or those that can provide a specific signature (permission).

Considering these factors, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getCpuUsages` method seems reasonable. This is because it deals with potentially sensitive system information and similar methods are also protected at this level, indicating a need for restricted access to prevent misuse or unauthorized data exposure.

**Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision reflects the method's interaction with system resources and the precedent set by similar APIs handling sensitive information, suggesting that `getCpuUsages` should be accessible only to system applications or those with the appropriate signature (permission).
