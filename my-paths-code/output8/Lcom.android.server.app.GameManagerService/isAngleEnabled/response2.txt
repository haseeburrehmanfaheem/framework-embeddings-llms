Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `isAngleEnabled` method.

The `isAngleEnabled` method is a getter method that returns a boolean value indicating whether angle is enabled for a given package. The method does not modify any data and only reads from existing settings.

Similar APIs, such as `getGameMode`, `getGameModeInfo`, and `getAvailableGameModes`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive game mode information. However, these methods are more sensitive than `isAngleEnabled` because they return more detailed information about game modes.

On the other hand, the `getRefreshRateSwitchingType` method has an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that it does not require any special permissions to access the refresh rate switching type. This method is similar to `isAngleEnabled` in that it returns a simple value without modifying any data.

Considering the similarities and differences between these APIs, I conclude that the `isAngleEnabled` method should have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because the method only reads from existing settings and does not modify any sensitive data, making it less sensitive than the other game mode-related APIs.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
