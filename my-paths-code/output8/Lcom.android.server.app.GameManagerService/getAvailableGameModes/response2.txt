Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getAvailableGameModes` method.

The method appears to be related to game mode management and interacts with sensitive data such as game configurations and override settings. The similar APIs provided, including `isAngleEnabled`, `setGameMode`, `getGameMode`, and `getGameModeInfo`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

Given the similarities in functionality and the sensitive nature of the data being accessed, I would conclude that the `getAvailableGameModes` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the method is protected from unauthorized access and maintains consistency with other similar APIs in the `GameManagerService` class.
