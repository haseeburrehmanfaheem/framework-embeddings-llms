To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableGameModes` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `getAvailableGameModes` method has three code paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path involves retrieving override configurations and game package configurations, calculating available game modes bitfield, and returning an array of integers representing the available game modes.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path also retrieves override configurations but returns an empty array of integers.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path simply calls another method `getAvailableGameModesUnchecked` and returns its result.

The similar APIs provided are:

* `isAngleEnabled`: This method has a similarity score of 0.7946 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves game mode from settings, gets configurations, and returns a boolean value.
* `setGameMode`: This method has a similarity score of 0.7906 and is also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves override configurations, disables compat scale, and sends a message.

Comparing the code paths and similar APIs, we can observe that:

* All methods interact with game-related configurations and settings.
* The `getAvailableGameModes` method does not modify any sensitive data or perform critical operations, unlike `setGameMode`.
* The method's return value is an array of integers representing available game modes, which does not seem to pose a significant security risk.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the `getAvailableGameModes` method does not require a high level of access control. Since it only retrieves information and does not modify sensitive data or perform critical operations, it is likely to be assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
