Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getGameModeInfo` method.

The `getGameModeInfo` method is a getter method that retrieves game mode information for a given package. The method interacts with the `PackageManager` to get application information and checks various settings and configurations related to game modes.

Looking at the similar APIs provided, we can see that they all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are related to game modes, package compatibility, and screen modes, which suggests that they require a certain level of system or signature permission to access or modify sensitive information.

The `getGameModeInfo` method, being a getter method, is likely to require less restrictive access control compared to the setter methods. However, considering the similarities with other APIs and the potential sensitivity of game mode information, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getGameModeInfo` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `getGameModeInfo` method is protected with a suitable access control level, considering its functionality and similarities with other APIs.
