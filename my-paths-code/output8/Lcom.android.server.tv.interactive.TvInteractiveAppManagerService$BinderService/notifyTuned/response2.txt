Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `notifyTuned` method.

The `notifyTuned` method has a high similarity with other methods in the same class that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods include `notifyError`, `notifyVideoAvailable`, `resetInteractiveApp`, `notifyTrackSelected`, and `notifySignalStrength`. All of these methods have similarities in their code structure, including the use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` to retrieve the calling user's ID and process ID, respectively. They also all interact with the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService` class and its related session states.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `notifyTuned` method should have a similar access control level as these other methods. Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `notifyTuned` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
