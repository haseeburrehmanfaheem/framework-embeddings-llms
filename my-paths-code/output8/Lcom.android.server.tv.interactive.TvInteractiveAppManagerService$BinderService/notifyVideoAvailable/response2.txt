Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `notifyVideoAvailable` API.

The `notifyVideoAvailable` API has similarities with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These similar APIs include:

* `notifyError`
* `notifyTuned`
* `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`
* `notifySignalStrength`
* `resetInteractiveApp`

All of these APIs have a high similarity score (above 0.92) with the `notifyVideoAvailable` API, and they all have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `notifyVideoAvailable` API is likely to require a similar level of access control.

Furthermore, the `notifyVideoAvailable` API appears to be related to interactive TV apps and sessions, which may involve sensitive operations that require elevated privileges. The use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` suggests that the API is checking the caller's identity and permissions, which is consistent with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the semantics of the `notifyVideoAvailable` API, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
