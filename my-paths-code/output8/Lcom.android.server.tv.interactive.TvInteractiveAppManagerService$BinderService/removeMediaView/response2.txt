Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `removeMediaView` API.

The similar APIs provided have a high similarity score (above 0.8) and are all assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. These APIs interact with the same sinks as the `removeMediaView` API, which is `ITvInteractiveAppSession`. The semantics of these APIs also suggest that they are related to managing TV interactive app sessions, which requires a high level of access control.

Given this information, I conclude that the `removeMediaView` API should have the same access control level as the similar APIs, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the `removeMediaView` API interacts with sensitive data and requires a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications. The similar APIs provided also suggest that this level of access control is necessary for managing TV interactive app sessions.
