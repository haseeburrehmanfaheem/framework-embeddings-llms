Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `notifyTracksChanged` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `notifyTracksChanged` method is part of the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$BinderService` class and has three different code paths. The method interacts with the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface, which is also used by the similar APIs.

The similar APIs provided have the following characteristics:

* `notifyContentAllowed`: Similarity score of 0.9081050753593445 and 0.9079618453979492, with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
* `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse`: Similarity score of 0.8950928449630737, with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
* `destroyBiInteractiveApp`: Similarity score of 0.8509275913238525, with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
* `notifyAdResponse`: Similarity score of 0.8481460809707642, with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
* `removeMediaView`: Similarity score of 0.8465429544448853, with an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

All the similar APIs have a high similarity score and are assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This suggests that the `notifyTracksChanged` method should also be assigned a similar access control level.

Considering the semantics of the `notifyTracksChanged` method, which involves notifying the session about changes to tracks, it is likely that this method requires a similar level of protection as the other APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `notifyTracksChanged` method should be assigned an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
