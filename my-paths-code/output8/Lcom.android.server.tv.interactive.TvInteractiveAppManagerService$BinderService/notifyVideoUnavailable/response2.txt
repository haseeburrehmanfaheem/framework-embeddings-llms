The provided API, `notifyVideoUnavailable`, is similar to other APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These similar APIs include `relayoutMediaView`, `notifyTrackSelected`, `createMediaView`, `setSurface`, and `stopInteractiveApp`.

All of these APIs are related to TV interactive app management and have similar sink code entries, which involve handling incoming user IDs, getting or creating user states, and interacting with session states. They also all require a system or signature-level permission to access, as indicated by their `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Given the similarities between these APIs and `notifyVideoUnavailable`, it is reasonable to conclude that `notifyVideoUnavailable` should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized system or signature-level components can access this API and perform actions related to TV interactive app management.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
