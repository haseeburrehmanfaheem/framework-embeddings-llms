To determine the access control level for the `sendSigningResult` API, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `sendSigningResult` API has three code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0), all of which involve the following key steps:
1. Getting the calling user ID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and process ID using `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
2. Resolving the calling user ID using either `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` or `resolveCallingUserId`.
3. Retrieving a session state locked object using `getSessionStateLocked`.
4. Obtaining an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object from the session state.
5. Calling `sendSigningResult` on the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object.

The similar APIs provided are:
- `releaseSession(Landroid/os/IBinder;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.937482476234436 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- `notifyTuned(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/net/Uri;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.905540943145752 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to be called. The high similarity scores between these APIs and `sendSigningResult` suggest that `sendSigningResult` likely requires a similar level of access control.

Given the similarities in code structure and the involvement of user ID resolution, session state management, and interaction with `ITvInteractiveAppSession`, it is reasonable to conclude that `sendSigningResult` should have an access control level consistent with the similar APIs.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code paths and the similarity with other APIs, the final access control level for the `sendSigningResult` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination is made considering the need for system or signature-level permissions to securely manage interactive TV app sessions and ensure that only authorized processes can send signing results.
