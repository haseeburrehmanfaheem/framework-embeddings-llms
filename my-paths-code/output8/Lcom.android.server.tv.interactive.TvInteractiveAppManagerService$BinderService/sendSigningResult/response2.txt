To determine the access control level for the `sendSigningResult` method, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**: All the similar APIs provided (`releaseSession`, `notifyTuned`, `setSurface`, `relayoutMediaView`, `stopInteractiveApp`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permission to be invoked.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code entries for the similar APIs involve handling user IDs, getting session states, and interacting with `ITvInteractiveAppSession` objects. These operations seem to be related to managing TV interactive app sessions and require careful access control to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

3. **Method Semantics**: The `sendSigningResult` method appears to be involved in sending signing results to an interactive TV app session. This operation could potentially impact the security or functionality of the TV interactive app, suggesting that it should be protected against unauthorized access.

4. **Access Control Principles**: Given that the similar APIs are all protected at the `SYS_OR_SIG` level and considering the principles that writing data (as in sending signing results) usually poses a greater security risk than reading data, it is reasonable to conclude that the `sendSigningResult` method should also be protected at a similar or higher access control level.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `sendSigningResult` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the protection levels of similar APIs and reflects the potential security implications of the method's functionality.
