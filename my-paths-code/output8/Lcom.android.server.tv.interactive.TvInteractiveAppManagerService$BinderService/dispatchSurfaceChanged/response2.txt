To determine the access control level for the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths of the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method involve getting the calling UID and PID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`, respectively.
   - They also involve resolving the user ID through either `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` or `resolveCallingUserId`.
   - The methods then proceed to get a session state locked based on the provided parameters and finally dispatch the surface changed event to an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 
   - These APIs also deal with dispatching a surface changed event but in the context of `TvInputManagerService`.
   - Their code snippets show similarities with the paths of the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method under analysis, including getting the calling UID and PID, resolving the user ID, obtaining a session state, and then dispatching the surface changed event.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the similarities in their code paths with the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method under analysis, it suggests that the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method should also be assigned a similar access control level.
   - The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level typically indicates that the method can be accessed by system or signature applications, reflecting its potential to impact system functionality or security.

Based on this analysis, the final access control level for the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` API is determined as follows:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This determination aligns with the patterns observed in similar APIs and reflects the method's potential implications for system security or functionality.
