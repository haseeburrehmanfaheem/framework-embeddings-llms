Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I would assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method.

The reason for this decision is as follows:

1. All the similar APIs provided have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG", which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.
2. The `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method interacts with sensitive components, such as `ITvInteractiveAppSession`, which is similar to the interactions in the other APIs.
3. The method also uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` to retrieve the caller's UID and PID, which is a common pattern in Android APIs that require access control.
4. The method modifies the state of an interactive app session, which could potentially have security implications if not properly restricted.

Given these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that the `dispatchSurfaceChanged` method should have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to ensure that only authorized system or signature-level components can access and modify the interactive app session state.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
