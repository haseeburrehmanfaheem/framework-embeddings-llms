Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `resetInteractiveApp` API.

The `resetInteractiveApp` API has similarities with other APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs include:

* `notifyError`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `setTeletextAppEnabled`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `notifySignalStrength`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `notifyTuned`: SYS_OR_SIG

All of these APIs have similarities with the `resetInteractiveApp` API in terms of their code structure and the use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` to retrieve the caller's UID and PID. They also all interact with session states and ITV sessions, which suggests that they are related to TV interactive app management.

Given these similarities and the fact that all of the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, I conclude that the `resetInteractiveApp` API should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the `resetInteractiveApp` API requires a system or signature-level permission to be called, which suggests that it is a sensitive API that should only be accessible to trusted system components or applications with the necessary permissions.
