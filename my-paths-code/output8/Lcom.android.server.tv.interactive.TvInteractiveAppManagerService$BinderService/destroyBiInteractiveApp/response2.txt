Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, it appears that the `destroyBiInteractiveApp` method is related to managing TV interactive apps and sessions. The method's purpose is to destroy a bi-interactive app session.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are also related to managing TV interactive apps and sessions, such as notifying broadcast info responses, ad responses, content allowed, tracks changed, and removing media views.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `destroyBiInteractiveApp` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `destroyBiInteractiveApp` method should have a similar access control level. Therefore, the assigned access control level for the `destroyBiInteractiveApp` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level privileged entities can destroy bi-interactive app sessions, which helps to maintain the security and integrity of the TV interactive app management system.
