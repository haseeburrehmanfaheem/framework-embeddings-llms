Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, it appears that the `sendCurrentChannelUri` method is related to TV interactive app management and session state handling. The similar APIs have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

The `sendCurrentChannelUri` method seems to be handling sensitive information, such as the current channel URI, and interacting with session states and ITV interactive app sessions. Given the similarities with other APIs in the same class and their access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `sendCurrentChannelUri` method should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `sendCurrentChannelUri` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level privileged components can access and modify the sensitive information handled by this method.
