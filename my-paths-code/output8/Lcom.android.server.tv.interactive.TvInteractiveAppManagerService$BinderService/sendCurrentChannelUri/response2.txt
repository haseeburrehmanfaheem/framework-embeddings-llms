To determine the access control level for the `sendCurrentChannelUri` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve checking the calling user ID and getting a session state before calling `sendCurrentChannelUri` on an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object. This suggests that the method is interacting with sensitive TV interactive app sessions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `resolveCallingUserId`, `getSessionStateLocked`, and `getSessionLocked`, which are related to user and session management. These operations seem to be critical for controlling access to TV interactive app sessions.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs, `sendCurrentChannelLcn`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This level typically indicates that the API can only be called by system or signature applications, suggesting that these operations are sensitive and require a high level of permission.
   - The similarity in code structure and purpose between `sendCurrentChannelUri` and `sendCurrentChannelLcn` implies that they might require similar access control levels to maintain consistency in security policies.

Given the above points:

- The method's interaction with sensitive session management and user ID resolution suggests a need for restricted access.
- The similarity with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level indicates that `sendCurrentChannelUri` likely requires a similar level of protection to prevent unauthorized access to TV interactive app sessions.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of the operations performed by `sendCurrentChannelUri` and its similarities with other APIs that are restricted to system or signature applications, the most appropriate access control level for this method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
