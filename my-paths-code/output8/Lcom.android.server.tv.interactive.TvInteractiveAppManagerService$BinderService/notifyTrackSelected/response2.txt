Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `notifyTrackSelected` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to TV interactive app management and TV input management, which suggests that they handle sensitive operations that require elevated permissions.

The `notifyTrackSelected` method is part of the `TvInteractiveAppManagerService$BinderService` class, which is responsible for managing TV interactive apps. The method notifies the TV interactive app session about track selection, which is a sensitive operation that requires proper authorization.

Given the similarities between the `notifyTrackSelected` method and the provided APIs, I conclude that it should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures that only authorized system or signature-level components can access this method and perform sensitive operations related to TV interactive app management.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
