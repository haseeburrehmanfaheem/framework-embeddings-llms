To determine the access control level for the `notifyTrackSelected` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0) but all essentially perform the same operation: they call `notifyTrackSelected` on an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object after resolving the user ID and getting a session state locked.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with user states, session states, and ultimately calling `notifyTrackSelected` on an `ITvInteractiveAppSession`. This suggests that the method is involved in managing or notifying interactive TV app sessions about track selections.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided: `notifyTuned(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/net/Uri;I)V`, both with a high similarity score to `notifyTrackSelected`. 
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given this information:

- The method interacts with system-level components (like user and session states) which suggests it requires some level of privilege.
- The similar APIs, which are also involved in notifying or managing TV app sessions, have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This implies that these operations are considered sensitive enough to require either system or signature-level permissions.

Considering the above points, it's reasonable to conclude that the `notifyTrackSelected` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it deals with similar functionality and likely requires comparable levels of privilege to operate securely and correctly within the system.

**Final Access Control Level:**
