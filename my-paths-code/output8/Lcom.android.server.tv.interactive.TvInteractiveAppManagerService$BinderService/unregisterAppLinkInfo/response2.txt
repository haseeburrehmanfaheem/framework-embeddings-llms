To determine the access control level for the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve the following key steps:

1. Resolving the calling user ID using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` or `resolveCallingUserId`.
2. Getting or creating a user state locked object using `getUserStateLocked` or `getOrCreateUserStateLocked`.
3. Retrieving an app map from the user state and getting an object from it based on the provided package name (`p1`).
4. If the object is found, creating a new service state object (`TvInteractiveAppManagerService$ServiceState`) and adding pending app link information to it.

The similar APIs provided also follow similar patterns:

* `sendAppLinkCommand`: Resolves the calling user ID, gets the user state, retrieves an app map, and creates a new service state object.
* `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList`: Resolves the calling user ID, gets or creates a user state, and iterates over a list of services.

All of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that they do not require any specific permissions to be executed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method follows similar patterns and does not require any special permissions. Therefore, its access control level should also be `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
