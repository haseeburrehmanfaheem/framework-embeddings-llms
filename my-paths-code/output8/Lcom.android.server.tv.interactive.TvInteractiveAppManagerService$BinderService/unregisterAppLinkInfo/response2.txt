Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method.

The `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method has a high similarity with other methods that have an access control level of `NONE`, such as `sendAppLinkCommand` and `getTvInteractiveAppServiceList`. These methods also interact with the same sinks, including `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` and `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getUserStateLocked`.

However, it's worth noting that the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method is modifying data by unregistering an app link info, which could potentially have security implications. On the other hand, reading data (e.g., getting a list of TV interactive app services) generally poses less security risk.

Considering these factors and the fact that similar APIs with high similarity have an access control level of `NONE`, I will assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision assumes that the `unregisterAppLinkInfo` method does not pose a significant security risk and can be accessed without requiring special permissions or restrictions. However, it's essential to review the specific implementation and requirements of the method to ensure this access control level is appropriate.
