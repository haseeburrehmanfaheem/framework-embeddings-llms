Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I have determined that the `notifyContentAllowed` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The reasoning behind this decision is as follows:

1. **Similarity with other APIs**: The `notifyContentAllowed` method has a high similarity (above 0.8) with other APIs in the same class, such as `notifyTracksChanged`, `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse`, `destroyBiInteractiveApp`, `sendCurrentTvInputId`, and `sendStreamVolume`. These APIs all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. **Sink code analysis**: The sink code entries for these similar APIs show that they all interact with the `ITvInteractiveAppSession` interface, which is also used in the `notifyContentAllowed` method. This suggests that the `notifyContentAllowed` method is likely to be used in a similar context and requires similar access control.
3. **Access control level consistency**: To maintain consistency with other APIs in the same class, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `notifyContentAllowed` method.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `notifyContentAllowed` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
