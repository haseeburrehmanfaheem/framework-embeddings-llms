Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level to the `sendCurrentTvInputId` method.

The similar APIs provided have a high similarity score (above 0.82) and all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are also part of the same class (`Lcom.android.server.tv.interactive.TvInteractiveAppManagerService$BinderService`) and interact with the same sink (`ITvInteractiveAppSession`).

Given that the `sendCurrentTvInputId` method is similar to these APIs in terms of its code structure, sink interaction, and class membership, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level.

Furthermore, considering the principle that if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level, and since `sendCurrentTvInputId` seems to be related to modifying or sending data (similar to the other APIs), it's logical to apply a similar or higher access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I conclude that the `sendCurrentTvInputId` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
