To determine the access control level for the `stopInteractiveApp` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 2, 1, and 0) that all ultimately lead to calling `stopInteractiveApp()` on an `ITvInteractiveAppSession` object after resolving user IDs and acquiring session states.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `ActivityManager`, resolution of user IDs, acquisition of session states, and the final call to `stopInteractiveApp()`. These are critical for understanding how the method interacts with system components and manages sessions.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs (`startInteractiveApp`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to interactive apps (starting or stopping them) require a significant level of permission, likely due to their potential impact on the system's state and user experience.
   - The similarity in code structure between `stopInteractiveApp` and `startInteractiveApp`, including the resolution of user IDs and interaction with session states, implies that they might be subject to similar access control considerations.

Given these points:

- **Similarity with Other APIs**: The high similarity scores (0.9899329543113708 and 0.9830931425094604) with `startInteractiveApp` methods, which are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggest that `stopInteractiveApp` should have a similar access control level due to its analogous functionality and potential system impact.
- **System Impact**: The method's interaction with system components (e.g., resolving user IDs, managing session states) indicates it could affect the system's security or functionality, aligning with the characteristics of `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.

Therefore, considering the similarities in functionality, code structure, and potential system impact with other APIs classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, the most appropriate access control level for the `stopInteractiveApp` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
