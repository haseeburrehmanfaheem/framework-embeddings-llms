Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `stopInteractiveApp` API.

The `stopInteractiveApp` API has a high similarity with other APIs that have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs include `startInteractiveApp`, `createBiInteractiveApp`, `releaseSession`, `setSurface`, and `notifyTrackSelected`. All of these APIs have a similarity score above 0.93, which indicates a strong resemblance in their code structure and functionality.

Additionally, the sink code entries for these APIs show that they all involve interacting with user sessions, session states, and ITV interactive app sessions, which suggests that they require a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

Given this information, I conclude that the `stopInteractiveApp` API should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is similar in functionality and code structure to other APIs with this access control level.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
