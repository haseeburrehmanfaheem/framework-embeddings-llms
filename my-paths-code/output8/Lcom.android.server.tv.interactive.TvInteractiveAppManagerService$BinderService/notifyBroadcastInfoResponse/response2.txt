To determine the access control level for the `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets for `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` show that it interacts with session states and notifies the ITV interactive app session about broadcast info responses. The method uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()` to get the caller's UID and PID, which are then used to resolve the calling user ID. This suggests that the method is performing some kind of authentication or authorization.

The similar APIs provided, `notifyAdResponse` and `requestBroadcastInfo`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with session states and perform notifications or requests related to TV interactive apps.

Given the similarities between these methods and the fact that they all seem to be part of a TV interactive app management system, it's reasonable to conclude that `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` should have a similar access control level.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
