Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to the `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method.

The reason for this decision is that all the similar APIs have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG", which suggests that this level of access control is required for methods that interact with TV interactive app sessions and broadcast info responses. The similarities in code structure and sink code entries between these APIs also support this conclusion.

Additionally, the `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method appears to be handling sensitive information related to TV interactive apps and broadcast info responses, which requires a higher level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

Therefore, I conclude that the `notifyBroadcastInfoResponse` method should have an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to ensure the security and integrity of the TV interactive app system.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
