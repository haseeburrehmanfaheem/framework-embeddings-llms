Based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, it appears that the `sendTrackInfoList` method is related to TV interactive app management and session state handling. The similar APIs provided, such as `notifyTuned`, `notifyVideoAvailable`, `notifyError`, `requestAd`, and `resetInteractiveApp`, all have a similarity score above 0.87 and are assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the similarities in code structure and the involvement of session state handling, it is reasonable to conclude that the `sendTrackInfoList` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because these methods seem to be part of a larger system for managing TV interactive apps and sessions, and they all require a similar level of access control to ensure proper security and functionality.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `sendTrackInfoList` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
