To determine the access control level for the `releaseSession` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `releaseSession` API has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve the following key steps:

1. Getting the calling user ID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`.
2. Resolving the calling user ID using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` or `resolveCallingUserId()`.
3. Acquiring a lock using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock(this.this$0)`.
4. Releasing a session state using `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked()` or `releaseSessionLocked()`.

The similar APIs, `stopInteractiveApp` and `relayoutMediaView`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also involve getting the calling user ID, resolving it, acquiring a lock, and performing some action on a session state.

Comparing the code of `releaseSession` with these similar APIs, we can see that they share similar patterns and interact with the same sinks (e.g., `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` and `TvInteractiveAppManagerService.getSessionStateLocked()`). The main difference is that `releaseSession` releases a session state, while the other APIs perform different actions on the session state.

Given these similarities and the fact that the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `releaseSession` API should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the `releaseSession` API in JSON format:
