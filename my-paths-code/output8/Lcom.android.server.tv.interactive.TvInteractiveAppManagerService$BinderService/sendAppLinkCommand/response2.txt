To determine the access control level for the `sendAppLinkCommand` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs. The provided code snippets show how the method interacts with various system components, such as user states, service states, and pending commands.

1. **Analysis of Code Snippets**:
   - All paths (1, 2, and 3) involve checking the calling user ID using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser` or `resolveCallingUserId`, which suggests a level of access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform actions.
   - The method then retrieves or creates a user state based on this user ID, indicating management of user-specific data.
   - It accesses maps (`mIAppMap`, `mServiceStateMap`) to retrieve or update service states and pending commands for specific applications, which involves managing application-level data.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API `unregisterAppLinkInfo` has an access control level of `NONE`. This method also deals with user states, service states, and application-specific data, similar to `sendAppLinkCommand`.
   - Both methods perform checks on the calling user ID and manage application-level data within the context of user states.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that `unregisterAppLinkInfo` has an access control level of `NONE` and considering the similarities in how both methods handle user and application-specific data, it suggests that `sendAppLinkCommand` might not require a high level of access control.
   - The method's interactions with system components are primarily focused on managing TV interactive app services within the context of user states, which does not inherently suggest dangerous or system/signature-level operations.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis and comparison, `sendAppLinkCommand` seems to operate within a realm that does not necessitate strict access control beyond what is already implemented through user ID checks and management of application states.
   - Therefore, assigning an access control level similar to its counterparts seems reasonable.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\{ "access_control_level": "NONE" \}}$
