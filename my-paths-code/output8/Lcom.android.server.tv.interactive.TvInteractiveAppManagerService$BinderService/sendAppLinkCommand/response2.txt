Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `sendAppLinkCommand` method.

The `sendAppLinkCommand` method has similarities with other APIs that have access control levels of `NONE`, `SYS_OR_SIG`. However, considering the method's functionality, which involves sending commands to interactive TV apps and potentially binding services, I would lean towards a more restrictive access control level.

Given the similarities with `unregisterAppLinkInfo` (access control level: `NONE`) and other APIs with higher access control levels (`SYS_OR_SIG`), I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `sendAppLinkCommand` method. This is because the method's functionality, while potentially sensitive, does not seem to require the highest level of restriction (i.e., `SYS_OR_SIG`).

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision takes into account the method's potential impact on the system and the need for a balance between security and usability. However, please note that this assessment may not be exhaustive, and additional context or information might lead to a different conclusion.
