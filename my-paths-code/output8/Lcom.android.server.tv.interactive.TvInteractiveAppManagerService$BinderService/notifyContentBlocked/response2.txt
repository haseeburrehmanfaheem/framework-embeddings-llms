Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, it appears that the `notifyContentBlocked` method is related to managing TV interactive apps and sessions. The similar APIs all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access.

The `notifyContentBlocked` method seems to be notifying an ITV interactive app session about blocked content, which could potentially involve sensitive operations or data. Given the similarities with the other APIs and their access control levels, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `notifyContentBlocked` method.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `original_method` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities with other APIs that interact with TV interactive app sessions and the potential sensitivity of the operations involved.
