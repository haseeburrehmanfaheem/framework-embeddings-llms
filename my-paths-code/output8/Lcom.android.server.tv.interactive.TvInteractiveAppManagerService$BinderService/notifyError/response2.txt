Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to the `notifyError` method.

The reasoning behind this decision is as follows:

1. The `notifyError` method has a high similarity with other methods that have been assigned the "SYS_OR_SIG" access control level, such as `notifyTuned`, `notifySignalStrength`, `resetInteractiveApp`, `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`, and `notifyVideoAvailable`. This suggests that the `notifyError` method is likely to require a similar level of access control.

2. The `notifyError` method interacts with sensitive data and functionality, such as session states and interactive app sessions, which are also interacted with by the other methods mentioned above. This interaction with sensitive data and functionality requires a higher level of access control to prevent unauthorized access or modification.

3. The `notifyError` method does not appear to have any characteristics that would suggest it requires a lower level of access control, such as "NONE" or "NORMAL". The method's functionality and interactions with sensitive data and functionality are consistent with the "SYS_OR_SIG" access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I would assign an access control level of "SYS_OR_SIG" to the `notifyError` method.
