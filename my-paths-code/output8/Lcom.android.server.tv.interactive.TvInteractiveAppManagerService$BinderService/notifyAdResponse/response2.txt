Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, it can be observed that all the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are related to TV interactive app management services and involve operations such as notifying ad responses, broadcast info responses, tuned notifications, releasing sessions, track selections, and stopping interactive apps. All these operations seem to require a system or signature-level permission to ensure that only authorized components can interact with the TV interactive app manager service.

Given the similarities in the code snippets and the access control levels of the similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `notifyAdResponse` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This ensures consistency in access control across related APIs and maintains the security posture by restricting these sensitive operations to system or signature-level components.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `original_method` API (`notifyAdResponse`) is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
