To determine the access control level for the `getFlashLockState` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and similar APIs with their assigned access control levels.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - The method `getFlashLockState` has three different code paths (Path 1, Path 2, Path 3) that all start by retrieving a system property "ro.boot.flash.locked" using `SystemProperties.get()`. This suggests that the method is interacting with system-level properties.
   - Each path then checks the value of this property and returns an integer based on whether it equals "0" or "1". The return values are `-1`, `1`, or `0` across the different paths, indicating different states related to flash lock.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code snippets provided all involve retrieving the system property "ro.boot.flash.locked" and checking its value against "0" or "1". This is consistent with the method's code paths and suggests that the critical aspect of this method is its interaction with system properties.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The similar APIs (`isDeviceOemUnlocked()Z`) have a high similarity score (above 0.96) with `getFlashLockState`, indicating they share significant functionality or structure.
   - Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to execute, likely due to their interaction with sensitive system properties.

Given these analyses:
- The method interacts with system properties ("ro.boot.flash.locked"), which is a sensitive operation typically requiring elevated permissions.
- The similar APIs (`isDeviceOemUnlocked()Z`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that such operations are considered to require system or signature-level access due to their sensitivity.

**Conclusion**: Based on the interaction with system properties and the similarity with other APIs that require system or signature-level permissions, the `getFlashLockState` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
