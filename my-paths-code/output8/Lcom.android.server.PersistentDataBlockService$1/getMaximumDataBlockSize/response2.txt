To determine the access control level for the `getMaximumDataBlockSize` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths, but all of them involve checking the calling UID and then performing operations related to getting the maximum data block size. This suggests that the method is sensitive to who is calling it, implying a need for access control.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with `PersistentDataBlockService`, specifically getting the block device size and calculating based on that. These operations seem to be related to low-level system functionality, which often requires restricted access.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `getOemUnlockEnabled()Z` has a similarity score of 0.8973588943481445 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also interacts with `PersistentDataBlockService` and performs operations that seem to require system or signature-level permission.
   - `getDataBlockSize()I` has a similarity score of 0.7706867456436157 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves file operations and getting total data size, which could be sensitive.

Given the similarities in functionality and the need for restricted access (as indicated by the use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and interactions with system services like `PersistentDataBlockService`), it's reasonable to conclude that the `getMaximumDataBlockSize` method should also have a similar access control level. The fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` suggests that this method likely requires protection at a system or signature level to prevent unauthorized access.

**Access Control Level Decision**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `getMaximumDataBlockSize` method is `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs and reflects the need for restricted access due to its interactions with sensitive system functionalities.
