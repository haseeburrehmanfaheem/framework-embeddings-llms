To determine the access control level for the `restart` method, we should consider the similarities with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `setImeWindowStatus` and `shutdown`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The key aspects to focus on include:
1. **Similarity in Code Structure**: All methods involve posting a synthetic lambda function to a handler (`mHandler.post()`), which suggests they are interacting with system-level services or performing actions that require specific permissions.
2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: Both `setImeWindowStatus` and `shutdown` have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permission to execute, as they likely interact with sensitive system components or data.

Given these points:
- The `restart` method's code structure is similar to that of the provided APIs (`setImeWindowStatus` and `shutdown`), involving posting to a handler.
- The access control levels of the similar APIs are `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting interactions that require elevated permissions, likely due to their impact on system services or components.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that the `restart` method would also require a similar level of access control, as it appears to interact with system-level components (in this case, related to the status bar service) in a manner that could potentially affect system behavior or security.

Therefore, based on the similarity in code structure and the access control levels of comparable APIs, the `restart` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
