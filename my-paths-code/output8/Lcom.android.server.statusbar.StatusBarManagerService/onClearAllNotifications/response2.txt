To determine the access control level for the `onClearAllNotifications` method in the `StatusBarManagerService` class, we need to consider the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `clearInlineReplyUriPermissions` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `onNotificationClear` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `notifySignalStrength` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
4. `notifyError` - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
5. `registerCallbackWithEventMask` - Access Control Level: NONE

The similarities between these APIs and `onClearAllNotifications` are based on the code structure and the use of `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.getCallingPid()`. However, the access control levels of the similar APIs are mostly SYS_OR_SIG, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

The `onClearAllNotifications` method is used to clear all notifications, which is a sensitive operation. Considering the similarities with other APIs and their access control levels, it's reasonable to assign a similar access control level to this method.

Based on the provided information, I would assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to the `onClearAllNotifications` method, as it requires system or signature-level permission to access.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities with other APIs and their access control levels, as well as the sensitive nature of the operation performed by the `onClearAllNotifications` method.
