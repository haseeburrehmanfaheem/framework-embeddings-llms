To determine the access control level for the `onClearAllNotifications` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `onClearAllNotifications` method is designed to clear all notifications. It takes an integer parameter `p1`, which could represent a user ID or another form of identifier, and it interacts with the `mNotificationDelegate` object to perform the clearing action.

2. **Analyzing Paths**:
   - **Path 1 (Depth 1)**: This path involves getting the calling UID and PID, clearing the calling identity temporarily, and then calling `onClearAll` on the `mNotificationDelegate` with the provided parameters.
   - **Path 2 (Depth 0)**: Similar to Path 1 but includes an additional step of enforcing the status bar service before proceeding. This suggests a check for whether the caller is authorized or has the necessary permissions.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet involves getting the calling UID and PID, which are then passed to `onClearAll` along with parameter `p1`. This indicates that the method's action might depend on the identity of the caller.

4. **Similar APIs**:
   - **clearInlineReplyUriPermissions**: Has a high similarity score (0.7946217656135559) and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It also interacts with `mNotificationDelegate` but for clearing inline reply URI permissions.
   - **onNotificationClear**: Another similar API with a high similarity score (0.784867525100708), also having an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It involves notification clearance based on various parameters.

Given the above analysis, we can observe that both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. The `onClearAllNotifications` method, by interacting with sensitive components like `mNotificationDelegate` and involving caller identity checks (getting UID/PID), suggests it handles operations that should be restricted to authorized callers.

Considering the enforcement of the status bar service in Path 2 and the interaction patterns similar to other SYS_OR_SIG APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `onClearAllNotifications` also requires a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized clearing of notifications, which could compromise user privacy or system integrity.

**Final Access Control Level**:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
This decision is based on the method's functionality, its interaction with sensitive system components, and the similarity in access control levels with other related APIs.
