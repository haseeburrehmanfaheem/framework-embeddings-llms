To determine the access control level for the `requestTileServiceListeningState` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `clickTile` and `addTile`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The similarity scores between `requestTileServiceListeningState` and these APIs are 0.750471293926239 for `clickTile` and 0.7231485247612 for `addTile`, indicating a high degree of similarity in their code structure or functionality.

Given that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that the operations they perform (or are related to) require system or signature-level permissions, which are typically reserved for actions that could potentially affect the system's behavior or security.

The code snippet provided for `requestTileServiceListeningState` shows a conditional call to `this.mBar.requestTileServiceListeningState(p1);`, which is similar in structure to the calls made by the similar APIs (`clickTile` and `addTile`). This implies that `requestTileServiceListeningState` might also be interacting with system-level components or performing actions that require elevated permissions.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that `requestTileServiceListeningState` should have a similar access control level to its highly similar counterparts, which are both classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `requestTileServiceListeningState` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
