To determine the access control level for the `requestTileServiceListeningState` method in the `StatusBarManagerService` class, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `clickTile(ComponentName)`: This method has a similarity of 0.7504713535308838 with `requestTileServiceListeningState` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `addTile(ComponentName)`: With a similarity of 0.7231485247612, this method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
3. `cancelRequestAddTile(String)`: Although its parameter type differs (using `String` instead of `ComponentName`), it shows a similarity of 0.7175686359405518 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

All the similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to execute. This suggests that operations related to interacting with tiles in the status bar, such as clicking, adding, or managing their states, are considered sensitive and thus restricted to system-level components or those signed with the platform key.

Given the similarities in functionality and the access control levels of these comparable methods, it's reasonable to conclude that `requestTileServiceListeningState` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because requesting the listening state of a tile service could potentially expose sensitive information or allow for unauthorized control over system UI elements, which aligns with the need for system or signature-level access control.

Therefore, based on the provided similarities and the standard practice of securing methods that can modify or interact with sensitive system components, the access control level for `requestTileServiceListeningState` should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
