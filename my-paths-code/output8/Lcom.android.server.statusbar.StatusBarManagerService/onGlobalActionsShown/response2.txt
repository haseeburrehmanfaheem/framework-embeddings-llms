To determine the access control level for the `onGlobalActionsShown` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths and operations:
   - Path 1 (depth 1) checks if `mGlobalActionListener` is not null but doesn't perform any significant action that requires elevated permissions.
   - Path 2 (depth 0) includes a call to `enforceStatusBarService()`, which suggests it's checking for the status bar service permission, and then clears the calling identity without performing any sensitive operations directly within this snippet.
   - Path 3 (depth 0) also calls `enforceStatusBarService()` and then notifies the global action listener if it's not null. This path involves more interaction with potential external listeners.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code provided includes a call to `enforceStatusBarService()`, clearing the calling identity, checking for a non-null `mGlobalActionListener`, and then calling its `onGlobalActionsShown()` method. This sequence suggests that the method is designed to interact with status bar services securely.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `onGlobalActionsHidden()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and involves enforcing the status bar service permission before notifying a listener about global actions being hidden.
   - `reportPerceptibleAsync` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It clears the calling identity, updates internal state related to perceptibility, and interacts with UI states, indicating operations that require system or signature-level permissions.

Given these points:

- The presence of `enforceStatusBarService()` in two paths and the sink code indicates a need for status bar service permission, which typically requires system or signature-level access.
- The interaction with external listeners (`mGlobalActionListener`) suggests a potential for affecting or being affected by other components' states, which could imply a need for careful permission management.
- The similarity with `onGlobalActionsHidden()` and `reportPerceptibleAsync`, both of which are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, supports the notion that operations related to global actions and status bar services require elevated permissions.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's interaction with status bar services, its enforcement mechanisms, and the similarities with other APIs classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for `onGlobalActionsShown` should also be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
