To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationClear` method in the `StatusBarManagerService` class, we should consider the similarities and access control levels of the provided similar APIs. 

All the similar APIs (`onNotificationError`, `onNotificationClick`, `onNotificationBubbleChanged`, `onNotificationActionClick`, and `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods, which are related to notification management and interact with the `mNotificationDelegate`, require a system or signature-level permission to be invoked. 

Given that the `onNotificationClear` method also interacts with the `mNotificationDelegate` and is involved in the management of notifications (specifically, clearing them), it's reasonable to infer that it should have a similar access control level to prevent unauthorized or malicious clearance of notifications.

Therefore, considering the similarities in functionality and the need for secure management of notifications, the `onNotificationClear` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
