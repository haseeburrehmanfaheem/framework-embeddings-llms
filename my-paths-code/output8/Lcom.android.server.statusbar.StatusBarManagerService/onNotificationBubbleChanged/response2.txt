Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, it appears that the `onNotificationBubbleChanged` method is related to notification management and interacts with the `mNotificationDelegate` object, which is also used by the similar APIs.

The similar APIs (`onNotificationVisibilityChanged`, `onBubbleMetadataFlagChanged`, `onNotificationError`, `onNotificationClick`, and `onNotificationClear`) all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `onNotificationBubbleChanged` method, it is likely that this method also requires a similar level of access control. Additionally, the fact that the method interacts with the `mNotificationDelegate` object, which is used by other system-level notification management APIs, further supports the conclusion that this method should have a restricted access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities between the APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `onNotificationBubbleChanged` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
