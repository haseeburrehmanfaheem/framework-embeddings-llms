To determine the access control level for the `onPanelRevealed` method in the `StatusBarManagerService` class, we should consider the similarities with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels. The provided similar APIs all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests they require system or signature-level permission to execute.

Given that:
- All similar APIs (`onNotificationVisibilityChanged`, `onNotificationBubbleChanged`, `onNotificationFeedbackReceived`, `onNotificationClick`, and `onNotificationError`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
- These methods, like `onPanelRevealed`, interact with the `mNotificationDelegate`, suggesting they are part of a cohesive set of APIs managing notifications and thus likely require similar levels of protection.
- The method `onPanelRevealed` itself does not directly modify sensitive data but rather notifies the delegate about panel visibility changes. However, considering the context of notification management, such operations might still be restricted to system or signature-level permissions to maintain control over who can interact with the notification system.

Based on these considerations and the principle that if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should have an equal or higher access control level (though this specific case involves notification callbacks rather than traditional getters and setters), it's reasonable to conclude that `onPanelRevealed` should also be restricted to `SYS_OR_SIG` to maintain consistency with other similar APIs in terms of security and access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `original_method` API (which is `onPanelRevealed` in this context) is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
