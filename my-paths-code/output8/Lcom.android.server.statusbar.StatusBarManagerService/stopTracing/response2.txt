To determine the access control level for the `stopTracing` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet of `stopTracing` Method**: The method checks if `this.mBar` is equal to 0. If true, it sets `this.mTracingEnabled` to 0 and then calls `this.mBar.stopTracing()`. This suggests that the method is involved in managing or controlling some tracing functionality.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code includes setting `this.mTracingEnabled` to 0 and calling `this.mBar.stopTracing()`, which directly relates to stopping a tracing operation.

3. **Similar API - `startTracing()`**:
   - **Similarity Score**: High at 0.9065252542495728, indicating that the functionality of `stopTracing` is closely related to `startTracing`.
   - **Access Control Level of `startTracing()`**: NONE.
   - The code for `startTracing()` also checks `this.mBar` and then starts tracing if it's not 0, setting `this.mTracingEnabled` to 1.

Given these points:

- Both `stopTracing` and `startTracing` methods seem to be managing the state of tracing (enabling or disabling it) based on the value of `this.mBar`.
- The access control level for `startTracing()` is NONE, suggesting that starting the trace does not pose significant risks or require special permissions.
- Stopping a trace (`stopTracing`) logically complements starting one and likely has similar security implications.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that stopping tracing doesn't inherently introduce significant security risks or require elevated permissions beyond what's necessary for starting the trace. Thus, the access control level for `stopTracing` should align with that of `startTracing`, which is NONE.

**Final Access Control Level:**
