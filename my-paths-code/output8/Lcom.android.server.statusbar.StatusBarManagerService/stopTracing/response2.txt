To determine the access control level for the `stopTracing` method in the `StatusBarManagerService` class, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar API Analysis**: The similar API provided is `startTracing()V` within the same class, `Lcom.android.server.statusbar.StatusBarManagerService`. This method has a similarity score of 0.9065252542495728 with `stopTracing`, indicating a high degree of similarity in their code structure or functionality.

2. **Access Control Level of Similar API**: The `startTracing` method has an assigned access control level of `NONE`. Given that starting and stopping tracing are complementary operations, it's reasonable to consider that they might require similar levels of access control, assuming the sensitivity of the data or operation is consistent between these two states.

3. **Operation Sensitivity**: The operation of stopping tracing seems to be related to debugging or logging mechanisms within the system bar. This kind of operation typically doesn't involve highly sensitive user data but could potentially impact system performance or behavior if misused.

4. **Setter and Getter Consideration**: While there's no explicit getter mentioned for `mTracingEnabled`, the principle that writing data (in this case, stopping tracing) usually poses a greater security risk than reading it suggests that if a corresponding getter were protected, the setter (or in this case, `stopTracing`) should be secured with an equal or higher access control level. However, given the context and the similar API's access control level, this principle might not necessitate a higher protection level for `stopTracing`.

Considering these points:

- The high similarity between `startTracing` and `stopTracing` suggests that they could share similar access control requirements.
- The access control level of `NONE` for `startTracing` implies that the operation is not considered highly sensitive or risky in terms of security or privacy.

Given this analysis, it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `stopTracing`, as there's no indication provided that stopping tracing would introduce significantly different security risks compared to starting it.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the similarity with `startTracing`, the nature of the operation, and the assumption that stopping tracing does not pose a significant security risk that would necessitate a higher level of access control.
