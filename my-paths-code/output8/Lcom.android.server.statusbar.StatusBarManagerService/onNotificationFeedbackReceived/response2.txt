To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method, we should consider the similarities and access control levels of the provided similar APIs. All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require a system or signature-level permission to be accessed.

The `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method is also part of the `StatusBarManagerService` class, which suggests that it might be handling sensitive notification-related operations. The method calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);`, which is similar to the sink code entries in the provided APIs.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method should also have a similar access control level. 

Therefore, based on the information provided, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
