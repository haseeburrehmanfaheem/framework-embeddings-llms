To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationDirectReplied` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with different depths. Both paths call `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationDirectReplied(p1);`, which is identified as a sink. The key difference between the two paths is the presence of `p0.enforceStatusBarService();` in path 2, which suggests an additional permission check.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code is `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationDirectReplied(p1);`, indicating that the method's primary action involves notifying a delegate about a direct reply to a notification.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `onNotificationFeedbackReceived`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8068280816078186 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It also interacts with `this.mNotificationDelegate`, suggesting that both methods are part of a system-level or signature-protected interface for handling notifications.
   - `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`: With a similarity score of 0.8028278946876526 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, this method further supports the notion that these notification handling methods require system or signature-level permissions to protect sensitive operations.

Given these points:

- The presence of `p0.enforceStatusBarService();` in one of the paths suggests a permission check, which is typically associated with system-level services.
- The similarity in access control levels (SYS_OR_SIG) among related APIs (`onNotificationFeedbackReceived` and `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`) implies that these methods are part of a protected interface, likely requiring either system-level access or signature verification to ensure that only authorized components can interact with notification delegates.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's interaction with sensitive system components (notification delegates), the presence of permission checks, and the similarity with other SYS_OR_SIG protected APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `onNotificationDirectReplied` should also be protected at a similar level to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of notification handling mechanisms.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
