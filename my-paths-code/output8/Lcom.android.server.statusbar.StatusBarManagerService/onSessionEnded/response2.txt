To determine the access control level for the `onSessionEnded` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with similar APIs.

All three code paths of `onSessionEnded` ultimately lead to notifying session listeners about the end of a session. The first two paths involve checking the validity of the session type or if all sessions are being considered, and then iterating over listeners to notify them. The third path directly calls `this.mSessionMonitor.onSessionEnded(p1, p2)`, which suggests an interaction with a session monitor.

The similar APIs provided, `onSessionStarted(ILcom/android/internal/logging/InstanceId;)V`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are similar in structure and purpose to `onSessionEnded`, as they also deal with session management (starting sessions instead of ending them) and interact with session monitors or listeners.

Given the similarities between these APIs, both in terms of their functionality and their interaction with system components (like session monitors and listeners), it's reasonable to conclude that `onSessionEnded` should have a similar access control level. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that these methods are either system-internal or require a signature permission to call, which aligns with the nature of managing sessions and interacting with potentially sensitive system components.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, the final access control level for the `onSessionEnded` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects the method's interaction with system-level components and its role in session management, which is consistent with the access control levels assigned to similar APIs.
