Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `onSessionEnded` method.

The `onSessionEnded` method has similarities with other APIs that interact with session listeners and monitors. The most similar API is `onSessionStarted`, which has a similarity score of 0.9294410347938538 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `onSessionEnded` method may require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the `registerSessionListener` and `startOneTimePermissionSession` APIs, which have similarities with `onSessionEnded`, also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the assignment of a higher access control level to `onSessionEnded`.

On the other hand, the `unregisterSessionListener` and `releaseSessionWithManager` APIs have lower similarity scores and access control levels of `NONE`. However, these APIs are more related to removing or releasing sessions, whereas `onSessionEnded` is related to notifying session listeners, which may require a higher level of access control.

Considering the similarities with other APIs and the semantics of the `onSessionEnded` method, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to this method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, as well as the consideration of the method's semantics and potential security implications.
