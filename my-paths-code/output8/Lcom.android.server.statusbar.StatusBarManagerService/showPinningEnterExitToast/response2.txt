To determine the access control level for the `showPinningEnterExitToast` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The first similar API, `showPinningEscapeToast()V`, has a similarity score of 0.8482657074928284 and an access control level of NONE. This suggests that methods related to showing toasts in the context of pinning might not require strict access control since they are primarily involved in UI feedback rather than sensitive data manipulation.
   - The second similar API, `suppressAmbientDisplay(Z)V`, has a similarity score of 0.7396482229232788 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This method is related to controlling the ambient display based on a boolean parameter, which could be considered more sensitive as it involves system-level functionality.

2. **Method Semantics**:
   - The `showPinningEnterExitToast` method takes a boolean parameter `p1` and uses it to decide whether to show a toast through `this.mBar.showPinningEnterExitToast(p1);`. This action is primarily related to user interface feedback rather than accessing or modifying sensitive data.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Given that the method is involved in UI-related actions (showing a toast), which are generally less sensitive than operations involving data access or modification, it suggests a lower requirement for access control.
   - However, since this method interacts with system components (`this.mBar`), some level of access control might be necessary to prevent unauthorized UI manipulations.

Considering these points:

- The high similarity with `showPinningEscapeToast`, which has an access control level of NONE, suggests that the operation might not be highly sensitive.
- The interaction with system components via `this.mBar` could imply a need for some access restriction, but given the nature of the method (UI feedback), it's likely not as critical as operations that directly manipulate sensitive data or system settings.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's purpose and similarities with other APIs, especially the high similarity with an API having an access control level of NONE, and considering the principles of access control in Android, the `showPinningEnterExitToast` method would likely require a moderate level of access control. However, since it's primarily involved in UI feedback and not directly accessing or modifying sensitive data, the most appropriate access control level seems to be NORMAL, as it reflects a balance between security and the need for controlled access without overly restricting a relatively benign operation.
