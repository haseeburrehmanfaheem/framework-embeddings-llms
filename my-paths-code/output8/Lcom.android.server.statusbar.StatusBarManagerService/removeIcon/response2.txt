To determine the access control level for the `removeIcon` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with similar operations - removing an icon from `this.mIcons` and potentially calling `this.mBar.removeIcon(p1)` if `this.mBar` is not null or 0.

2. **Sink Code**: Both paths lead to similar sink code, involving the removal of an icon from `this.mIcons` and a call to `this.mBar.removeIcon(p1)` under certain conditions.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - The provided similar APIs (`setIconVisibility`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - These APIs interact with icons (setting visibility) and also involve operations on `this.mIcons` and calls to methods on `this.mBar`, similar to the `removeIcon` method.

Given these points, we can infer that:
- The operation performed by `removeIcon` is related to system or signature-level access because it involves modifying system UI elements (status bar icons), which typically requires higher privileges.
- The similarity in access control levels between `setIconVisibility` and the need for potentially privileged operations suggests that `removeIcon` should also be considered as requiring a similar level of access control.

Therefore, considering the interaction with system-level components (`this.mBar`) and the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeIcon` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
