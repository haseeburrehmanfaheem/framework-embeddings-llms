To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationSettingsViewed` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with different depths, but both ultimately call `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationSettingsViewed(p1);`. This suggests that the core functionality involves notifying a delegate about a settings view event.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink is identified as `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationSettingsViewed(p1);`, which aligns with the method's purpose of informing the notification delegate about settings being viewed.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8364088535308838 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It interacts with the notification delegate regarding visibility changes.
   - `onNotificationClick`: With a similarity score of 0.7779844999313354, this API also has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It involves notifying the delegate about a click event on a notification.

Given these points:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating they require either system or signature-level permission to execute.
- The `onNotificationSettingsViewed` method interacts with the same sink (`this.mNotificationDelegate`) as the similar APIs, suggesting it operates within a similar security context.
- The method's functionality is related to notification settings being viewed, which could potentially involve sensitive information or actions that should be restricted to system or authorized applications.

Considering these factors, the `onNotificationSettingsViewed` method likely requires a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized access to notification settings views. Therefore, it should also be classified as SYS_OR_SIG to maintain consistency with similar APIs and ensure security.
