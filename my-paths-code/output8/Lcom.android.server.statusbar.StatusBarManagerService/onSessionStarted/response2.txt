To determine the access control level for the `onSessionStarted` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sinks, and similar APIs.

The provided code paths show that the `onSessionStarted` method interacts with session listeners and a session monitor. The method checks if a session type is valid or if all sessions are contained in a specific set before proceeding to notify listeners.

Looking at the sink code, we see interactions with `this.mSessionMonitor.onSessionStarted(p1, p2);` and iterations over listeners to call their `onSessionStarted` methods. These operations suggest that the method is involved in managing or monitoring sessions, which could be related to system-level functionality or require specific permissions.

The similar APIs provided, `onSessionEnded`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are either system-internal (requiring system or signature-level permissions) due to their interaction with potentially sensitive session management functionalities.

Given the similarities in purpose and functionality between `onSessionStarted` and the provided `onSessionEnded` APIs, it's reasonable to infer that `onSessionStarted` would also require a similar level of access control. The method's involvement in session management and its potential to interact with system-level components or sensitive data aligns with the need for system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of code paths, sinks, and similarities with other APIs, the final access control level for the `onSessionStarted` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination is made considering the method's potential impact on system functionality and its similarity to other methods that are classified as requiring system or signature-level permissions.
