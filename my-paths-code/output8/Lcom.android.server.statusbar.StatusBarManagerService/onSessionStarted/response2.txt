To determine the access control level for the `onSessionStarted` method in the `StatusBarManagerService` class, we need to analyze the provided information.

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `onSessionEnded`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `registerSessionListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `unregisterSessionListener`: NONE
   - `addSessionsListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `startOneTimePermissionSession`: SYS_OR_SIG

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   The sink code for `onSessionStarted` involves notifying session listeners about the start of a session, which is similar to the operations performed by the similar APIs listed above.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Given that `onSessionEnded`, `registerSessionListener`, and `addSessionsListener` all have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, it suggests that managing or interacting with sessions (including starting them) is considered a sensitive operation.
   - The `unregisterSessionListener` having NONE as its access control level might seem like an outlier, but considering the principle that reading data (or in this case, stopping a listener) is generally less sensitive than writing or modifying data (starting a session), it doesn't directly influence our decision for `onSessionStarted`.
   - The operation of starting a session (`onSessionStarted`) can be seen as setting up or modifying the state of the system (in terms of active sessions), which typically requires a higher level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the similarities with other APIs that manage sessions and considering the principle that writing/modifying data is more sensitive than reading, `onSessionStarted` should have an access control level that reflects its potential impact on system state and security.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `onSessionStarted` would be **SYS_OR_SIG**, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar session management operations (`onSessionEnded`, `registerSessionListener`, `addSessionsListener`) and reflects the need to secure modifications to system sessions.
