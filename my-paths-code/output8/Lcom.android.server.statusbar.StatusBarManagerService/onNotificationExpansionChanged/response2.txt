To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method in the `StatusBarManagerService` class, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to be called. These APIs are all related to notification management and interact with the `mNotificationDelegate` object, similar to the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality between these APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `onNotificationExpansionChanged` method should also require a similar level of access control. The method's interaction with the `mNotificationDelegate` object and its role in managing notifications suggest that it should be protected at a level consistent with the other notification management APIs.

Furthermore, the presence of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` calls in one of the paths for `onNotificationExpansionChanged` suggests an awareness of security considerations related to caller identity, which aligns with the need for controlled access.

Therefore, based on the similarities with other APIs and the method's functionality within the `StatusBarManagerService`, the appropriate access control level for `onNotificationExpansionChanged` should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
