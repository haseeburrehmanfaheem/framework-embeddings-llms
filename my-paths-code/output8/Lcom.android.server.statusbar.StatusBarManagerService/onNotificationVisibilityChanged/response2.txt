To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` method in the `StatusBarManagerService` class, we should consider the similarities and access control levels of the provided similar APIs. All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to be accessed.

Given the similarities between these methods and `onNotificationVisibilityChanged`, it's reasonable to infer that `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` also requires a similar level of protection. The method interacts with the notification delegate, which is a sensitive operation that could potentially impact the security or functionality of the system if not properly restricted.

The fact that all provided similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests a pattern for methods within the `StatusBarManagerService` class that interact with the notification system. This consistency implies that such operations are considered sensitive and should be protected at a system or signature level to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

Therefore, based on the similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels, the `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
