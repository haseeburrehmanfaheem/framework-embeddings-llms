To determine the access control level for the `expandSettingsPanel` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with different depths, but both ultimately lead to the same sink code: `this.mBar.animateExpandSettingsPanel(p1);`. This suggests that the critical operation is the expansion of the settings panel.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves animating the expansion of the settings panel based on a condition (`if (this.mBar == 0)`). This implies interaction with system UI elements, which could potentially require specific permissions or access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications to the system's UI state.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `collapsePanels()V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The similarity score is relatively high (0.7576870918273926), indicating that these methods share significant functionality or operational contexts.
   - The code for `collapsePanels()` includes a check (`p0.checkCanCollapseStatusBar("collapsePanels")`) before performing the collapse operation, suggesting that there are access controls in place to regulate when such operations can be performed.

Given this analysis:

- **Path 1** does not explicitly enforce any checks before calling `animateExpandSettingsPanel`, which might suggest a lack of strict access control.
- **Path 2** includes an enforcement call (`p0.enforceExpandStatusBar();`), implying some level of access control or permission check is in place, although the specifics are not detailed here.
- The similarity with `collapsePanels()`, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level and includes explicit checks for permissions, suggests that `expandSettingsPanel` might also require a similar level of access control due to its potential impact on system UI state.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `expandSettingsPanel` seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it involves interaction with potentially sensitive system UI elements and is similar in functionality to another method that requires such access controls. This ensures that only authorized components or the system itself can expand the settings panel, maintaining the integrity of the system's UI.
