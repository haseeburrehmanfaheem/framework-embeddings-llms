To determine the access control level for the `stopActiveProjection` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve checking and managing media projection permissions or stopping projections. This includes interactions with `AppOpsManager` to check and set operation modes, which is a critical aspect of Android's permission system.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided show operations related to checking and setting modes for specific ops (in this case, op code 24), stopping media projections, and managing callbacks. These are sensitive operations that can impact user privacy and security.

3. **Similar APIs**: Two similar APIs are mentioned, both named `setContentRecordingSession`, with high similarity scores. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. However, their code snippets show interactions with `AppOpsManager` for checking and setting op modes, similar to the `stopActiveProjection` method. This suggests that despite having `NONE` as their access control level, they still deal with sensitive operations.

Given this analysis:

- The `stopActiveProjection` method deals with stopping media projections and managing related permissions.
- It interacts with `AppOpsManager`, which is crucial for permission management in Android.
- Similar APIs, although labeled with `NONE` access control, also handle sensitive permission-related operations.

However, the key factor here is understanding that `NONE` typically implies no specific access control restrictions are applied beyond the normal Android security model. Given the method's involvement in managing media projections and permissions, it might seem like it should have a higher access control level. Yet, based on the provided similar APIs and their access control levels, it suggests that the operations within `stopActiveProjection` are considered part of the normal functioning of media projection services and do not require elevated or dangerous permissions to execute.

Thus, considering the information provided and the typical implications of each access control level:

- **NONE**: No specific restrictions.
- **NORMAL**: General device operations that don't pose significant risk.
- **DANGEROUS**: Operations that could potentially harm the user, such as accessing location, contacts, etc.
- **SYS_OR_SIG**: System or signature-level permissions which are typically for system apps or require a specific signature to use.

Given the context and similar APIs having `NONE` access control, it seems reasonable to conclude that `stopActiveProjection` also does not require elevated permissions beyond normal operation, despite its interaction with sensitive operations like permission management. 

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This conclusion is drawn considering the method's functionality seems to be part of normal media projection management services, and similar APIs are labeled as `NONE`, suggesting that such operations might not be considered dangerous or requiring system/signature level access control in this specific context. However, the exact classification can depend on the broader security policies and the specific Android version's security model being referenced.
