To determine the access control level for the `getActiveProjectionInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `stopActiveProjection()V`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `setContentRecordingSession(Landroid/view/ContentRecordingSession;Landroid/media/projection/IMediaProjection;)V`: NONE
   - `createProjection(ILjava/lang/String;IZ)Landroid/media/projection/IMediaProjection;`: SYS_OR_SIG
   - `hasProjectionPermission(ILjava/lang/String;)Z`: NONE

2. **Semantics of the APIs**:
   - The `getActiveProjectionInfo` method seems to be retrieving information about an active media projection, which could potentially involve sensitive data or system-level operations.
   - The presence of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` suggests that this method is interacting with system-level components and is taking steps to manage the calling identity, possibly for security or permission management reasons.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink codes provided show interactions with media projection services and app ops managers, indicating that the method's operations are related to managing or querying media projections.
   - There's no explicit indication of dangerous operations like writing to external storage, sending SMS, or making calls, which would typically require `DANGEROUS` permission. However, the interaction with system services suggests a need for some level of access control.

4. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Given that this method is a getter and not a setter, it might not require as high a level of protection as methods that modify data or perform actions with significant security implications.
   - However, since it deals with system-level information (media projections), some form of access control is likely necessary to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Considering these points:

- **NONE** seems too permissive given the method's interaction with system services and potential for exposing sensitive information about media projections.
- **DANGEROUS** might be too restrictive since this is a getter method, and its operations don't seem to directly involve dangerous actions like those typically requiring `DANGEROUS` permissions (e.g., accessing location, contacts).
- **SYS_OR_SIG** could be appropriate given the method's involvement with system-level services and the need for some form of access control. This level suggests that either system or signature-level permissions are required, which aligns with the method's potential to interact with sensitive system information.
- **NORMAL** might seem like a middle ground, but without more specific details on what "normal" access entails in this context, it's harder to justify choosing this over **SYS_OR_SIG**, especially considering the system-level nature of the operations.

Given these considerations and the fact that similar methods (`stopActiveProjection` and `createProjection`) have been assigned **SYS_OR_SIG** access control, it seems reasonable to assign a similar level of access control to `getActiveProjectionInfo`, acknowledging its interaction with system services and potential for accessing sensitive information.
