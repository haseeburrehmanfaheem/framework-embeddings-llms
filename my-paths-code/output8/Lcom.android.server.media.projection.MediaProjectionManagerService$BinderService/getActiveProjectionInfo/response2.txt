To determine the access control level for the `getActiveProjectionInfo` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve checking a condition (`if (v2 != 0)`) and then using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` to manage the calling identity temporarily. This is typically done to perform operations that should not be attributed to the current caller for permission or auditing purposes.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve getting projection information from `this.mProjectionGrant` or calling other methods like `getActiveProjectionInfo` on different objects, and returning this information. This suggests that the method is involved in retrieving media projection details.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **stopActiveProjection()V**: This has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions to execute. The code involves checking operations with specific modes and stopping a projection, which implies a need for higher-level access control due to its potential impact on the system or user data.
   - **setContentRecordingSession(Landroid/view/ContentRecordingSession;Landroid/media/projection/IMediaProjection;)V**: This method has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that it does not require specific permissions beyond what is normally granted. The code checks for valid media projections and sets content recording sessions, which might not directly impact system security or privacy in the same way as stopping a projection.

Given these points:

- **getActiveProjectionInfo** seems to be primarily involved in retrieving information about active media projections without modifying system state or user data directly.
- The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3)` suggests an attempt to handle permissions or identity temporarily, which might imply some level of access control but does not necessarily indicate a need for the highest levels (`SYS_OR_SIG`).
- The similarity with **stopActiveProjection()V** (which requires `SYS_OR_SIG`) is notable, but **getActiveProjectionInfo** appears less invasive as it's focused on retrieving information rather than altering system state.
- The comparison with **setContentRecordingSession**, which has an access control level of `NONE`, suggests that if **getActiveProjectionInfo** does not pose significant risks to system security or user privacy, its access control could be more lenient.

Considering these factors and the fact that **getActiveProjectionInfo** is primarily about retrieving information (which generally poses less risk than modifying state), it seems reasonable to conclude that this method would likely require a moderate level of access control. However, given the choices provided (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), and considering the method's focus on information retrieval without direct system modification or clear indication of high-risk operations, ** NORMAL** seems like an appropriate choice as it reflects a need for some level of access control without requiring the highest permissions.
