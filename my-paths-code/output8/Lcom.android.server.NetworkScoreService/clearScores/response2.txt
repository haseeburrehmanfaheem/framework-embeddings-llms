To determine the access control level for the `clearScores` method in the `NetworkScoreService` class, we need to analyze the provided information, including the code paths and similar APIs with their assigned access control levels.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) that it can execute based on certain conditions.
   - In all paths, `INetworkScoreService$Stub.getCallingUid()` is called to get the UID of the calling process, indicating that access control is based on the caller's identity.
   - Path 3 (depth 0) directly calls `p0.enforceSystemOrIsActiveScorer(v1);`, which suggests a system or active scorer check. This implies a need for either system-level permission or being the active scorer to perform this action.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The most similar API, `disableScoring()V`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code paths also involve checking if the caller is the system or the active scorer.
   - Other similar APIs like `registerNetworkScoreCache` and `unregisterNetworkScoreCache` also have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that these operations are restricted to system-level or signed applications with specific permissions.
   - The `updateScores` method has an access control level of `NONE`, but its similarity score is lower compared to `disableScoring`. Moreover, updating scores might not require the same level of restriction as clearing scores, which could potentially impact network scoring more significantly.
   - The `getActiveScorer` method has a `DANGEROUS` access control level, implying it returns sensitive information. However, its similarity score is relatively low, and getting information doesn't necessarily equate to modifying system settings like clearing scores.

3. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given the direct check for system or active scorer status in the most straightforward path (depth 0) of `clearScores`, and considering the similarities with other APIs that require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it's reasonable to conclude that `clearScores` should also have a similar access control level.
   - The operation of clearing scores is significant as it affects network scoring, which could be critical for network management and security. Thus, restricting this action to system-level or specifically authorized applications (as indicated by the need to be an active scorer) aligns with Android's security principles.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of code paths, similar APIs, and considering the implications of clearing network scores, the access control level for the `clearScores` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
