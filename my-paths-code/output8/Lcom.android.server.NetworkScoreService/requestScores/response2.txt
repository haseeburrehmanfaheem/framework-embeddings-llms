To determine the access control level for the `requestScores` method, we need to analyze its code snippets and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `requestScores` method has three different paths with varying depths:

1. **Path 1 (Depth 2)**: This path checks if `mServiceConnection` is 0 and then attempts to call `requestScores` on `mRecommendationProvider`. If `mRecommendationProvider` is 0, it returns without performing any significant action.
   
2. **Path 2 (Depth 1)**: Similar to Path 1, but it retrieves `INetworkRecommendationProvider` through `mServiceConnection.getRecommendationProvider()` before calling `requestScores`.

3. **Path 3 (Depth 0)**: This path first calls `enforceSystemOnly()`, indicating that only system apps are allowed to execute this part of the code. It then attempts to get a recommendation provider and call `requestScores` on it.

The sink code provided shows interactions with `INetworkRecommendationProvider` to request scores, which is central to all paths of the `requestScores` method.

Given the similar APIs:
- `getActiveScorerPackage()Ljava/lang/String;` has an access control level of **DANGEROUS**. This method seems to retrieve the package name of the active network scorer without directly interacting with sensitive operations like requesting scores.
  
- `setActiveScorer(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` also has an access control level of **DANGEROUS**. It sets the active scorer package and enables network recommendations, which involves modifying system settings.

Considering these points:
- The `requestScores` method directly interacts with network recommendation providers to request scores, which could potentially involve sensitive operations or data.
- Path 3 explicitly calls `enforceSystemOnly()`, suggesting that at least one execution path of this method is intended for system use only, implying a level of sensitivity or security concern.
- The similar APIs (`getActiveScorerPackage` and `setActiveScorer`) are marked as **DANGEROUS**, indicating that operations related to network scorers and recommendations are considered sensitive.

Given the information above, the most appropriate access control level for the `requestScores` method would be **DANGEROUS** because it involves potentially sensitive operations related to requesting scores from network recommendation providers, and at least one of its paths is restricted to system-only access.
