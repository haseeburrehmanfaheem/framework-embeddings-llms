Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getActiveScorerPackage` method.

The `getActiveScorerPackage` method is a getter method that returns the package name of the active scorer. In Android, getter methods are generally considered less sensitive than setter methods, as they only provide read access to data.

Analyzing the similar APIs:

* `getActiveScorer()` has an access control level of DANGEROUS, but it returns a `NetworkScorerAppData` object, which contains more sensitive information than just the package name.
* `setActiveScorer(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` has an access control level of DANGEROUS, as it allows setting the active scorer, which is a more sensitive operation.
* `isCallerActiveScorer(I)Z` has an access control level of NONE, but it's a different type of method that checks if the caller is the active scorer.
* `queryCratesForUid(Ljava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/String;)Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, but it's a completely different API that deals with storage stats.
* `getAllValidScorers()Ljava/util/List;` has an access control level of DANGEROUS, as it returns a list of all valid scorers, which may contain sensitive information.

Considering the semantics of the `getActiveScorerPackage` method and the analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of NORMAL to this method. This is because the method only returns the package name of the active scorer, which is relatively less sensitive information compared to other APIs that deal with more sensitive data.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `getActiveScorerPackage` method has a reasonable access control level, considering its functionality and the sensitivity of the data it returns.
