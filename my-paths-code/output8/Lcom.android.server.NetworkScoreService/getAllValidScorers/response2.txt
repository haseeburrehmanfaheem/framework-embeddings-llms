To determine the access control level for the `getAllValidScorers` method in the `NetworkScoreService` class, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels**:
   - `getActiveScorer()`: DANGEROUS
   - `setActiveScorer(String)`: DANGEROUS
   - `getActiveScorerPackage()`: DANGEROUS
   - `notifyResourceGranted(II)`: NONE
   - `isCallerActiveScorer(I)`: NONE

2. **Sink Code and Method Behavior**:
   - The `getAllValidScorers` method interacts with the package manager to query intent services related to network scoring and recommendation. It also constructs `NetworkScorerAppData` objects based on the query results.
   - The method's behavior involves retrieving and processing sensitive information about installed packages that provide network scoring services.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - Given that the method retrieves sensitive information about network scorers, which could potentially include data about user preferences or network behaviors, it may require a certain level of access control.
   - However, since this method is primarily a getter and does not modify system settings or sensitive data directly (unlike `setActiveScorer`), its access control requirements might be less stringent than those of methods that can alter system state.

4. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar APIs (`getActiveScorer`, `setActiveScorer`, `getActiveScorerPackage`) are all classified as DANGEROUS, indicating they require significant access control due to their potential impact on system settings and user data.
   - In contrast, methods like `notifyResourceGranted` and `isCallerActiveScorer` have lower access control levels (NONE), suggesting that not all network-related operations necessitate high-level access controls.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the method's functionality as a getter of sensitive information but not a modifier of system state, and comparing it with similar APIs, the most appropriate access control level for `getAllValidScorers` seems to be NORMAL. This choice balances the need to protect sensitive information about network scorers with the recognition that merely retrieving this information does not pose as significant a risk as modifying system settings related to network scoring.

**Access Control Level Decision**:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision reflects a balanced approach, considering both the sensitivity of the data being accessed and the method's role in the system, which is primarily informational rather than operational.
