Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `setActiveScorer` method.

The `setActiveScorer` method is used to set the active scorer for network recommendations. This method has a significant impact on the system's behavior, as it determines which app will provide network recommendations.

Similar APIs, such as `getActiveScorer`, `getActiveScorerPackage`, and `getAllValidScorers`, have been assigned an access control level of `DANGEROUS`. These methods are related to retrieving information about the active scorer or valid scorers, which is sensitive data.

The `requestScores` method, which is used to request network scores from a recommendation provider, has been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method is also related to network recommendations, but it requires a higher level of access control due to its potential impact on system behavior.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and the `setActiveScorer` method, I conclude that the `setActiveScorer` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because setting the active scorer has a significant impact on the system's behavior and requires a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized changes.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-protected apps can set the active scorer, preventing potential security risks and maintaining the integrity of the system's network recommendation behavior.
