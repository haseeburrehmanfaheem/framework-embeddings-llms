Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getActiveScorer` method.

The `getActiveScorer` method is a getter method that returns the active scorer data. In Android, getter methods typically have a lower access control level than setter methods because reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `getActiveScorerPackage()` has an access control level of `DANGEROUS`, which suggests that getting the package name of the active scorer requires some level of protection.
* `setActiveScorer(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` also has an access control level of `DANGEROUS`, indicating that setting the active scorer requires protection against unauthorized modifications.
* `getAllValidScorers()` has an access control level of `DANGEROUS`, which implies that getting a list of all valid scorers requires some level of protection.

However, it's worth noting that `clearScores()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and `isCallerActiveScorer(I)Z` has an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs seem to have different access control requirements based on their specific functionality.

Considering the similarities between `getActiveScorer` and other getter methods, as well as the fact that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, I would assign a lower access control level to `getActiveScorer`.

Given the information provided and the analysis of similar APIs, I conclude that the `getActiveScorer` method should have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This is because getting the active scorer data may not require the same level of protection as setting or modifying it.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment takes into account the similarities with other APIs and the general principle that getter methods typically have lower access control levels than setter methods.
