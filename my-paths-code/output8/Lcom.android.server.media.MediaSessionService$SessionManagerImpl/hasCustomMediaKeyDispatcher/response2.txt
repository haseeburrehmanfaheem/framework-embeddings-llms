Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `hasCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` method.

The `hasCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` method is a getter method that checks if a custom media key dispatcher is set. The method does not modify any data and only returns a boolean value indicating whether a custom media key dispatcher is present.

The similar APIs provided, such as `setCustomMediaKeyDispatcher`, `setOnMediaKeyListener`, `hasCustomMediaSessionPolicyProvider`, `removeOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener`, and `setCustomMediaSessionPolicyProvider`, all have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods are either setter methods that modify data or getter methods that retrieve data, and they do not require any specific access control.

Given the semantics of the `hasCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` method and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I conclude that the `hasCustomMediaKeyDispatcher` method does not require any special access control. Therefore, the access control level for this method is `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
