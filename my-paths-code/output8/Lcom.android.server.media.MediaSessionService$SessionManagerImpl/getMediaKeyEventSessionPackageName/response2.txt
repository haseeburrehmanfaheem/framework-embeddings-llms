Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `getMediaKeyEventSessionPackageName` method.

The method is used to retrieve the package name of the media key event session. The similar APIs provided have varying levels of access control, but most of them require a system or signature-level permission (`SYS_OR_SIG`). 

However, upon closer inspection of the code snippets and sink code entries for `getMediaKeyEventSessionPackageName`, it appears that this method is primarily used to retrieve information about the current media session, which does not seem to pose a significant security risk. The method does not modify any sensitive data or perform any actions that could potentially harm the system.

Given this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getMediaKeyEventSessionPackageName` method. This is because the method is primarily used for retrieving information and does not seem to pose a significant security risk.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment takes into account the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and the method's primary purpose is to retrieve information about the current media session.
