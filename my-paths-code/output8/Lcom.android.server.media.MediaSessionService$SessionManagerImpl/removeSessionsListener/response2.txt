Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `removeSessionsListener` method.

The `removeSessionsListener` method has a similarity score of 0.8791732788085938 with the `removeSession2TokensListener` method, which has an access control level of NONE. This suggests that the `removeSessionsListener` method may not require strict access control.

Additionally, the `addSessionsListener` method, which is similar to `removeSessionsListener`, has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. However, this is likely due to the fact that `addSessionsListener` is a setter method that modifies the state of the system, whereas `removeSessionsListener` is a remover method that only removes a listener.

The `unregisterSessionListener` and `removeOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener` methods, which are also similar to `removeSessionsListener`, have access control levels of NONE. This further supports the idea that `removeSessionsListener` may not require strict access control.

Considering these factors, I assign an access control level of NONE to the `removeSessionsListener` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that removing a listener is generally considered a less sensitive operation than adding or modifying one, and the similar APIs provided do not suggest a need for strict access control.
