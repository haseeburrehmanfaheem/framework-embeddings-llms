After reviewing the provided code snippets and similar APIs, I can see that the `removeSessionsListener` method is used to remove a listener from a list of sessions listeners. The method takes an `IActiveSessionsListener` object as a parameter and removes it from the list if it exists.

The similar API `removeSession2TokensListener` has an access control level of `NONE`, which suggests that removing a listener from a list does not require any special permissions or access control.

On the other hand, the similar API `addSessionsListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that adding a listener to a list requires system or signature-level permission. However, this is likely because adding a listener involves linking to the listener's death notification, which requires additional permissions.

In the case of `removeSessionsListener`, the method only removes a listener from the list and does not involve any sensitive operations that would require special permissions. Therefore, based on the similarity with `removeSession2TokensListener` and the semantics of the API, I would assign an access control level of `NONE` to the `removeSessionsListener` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
