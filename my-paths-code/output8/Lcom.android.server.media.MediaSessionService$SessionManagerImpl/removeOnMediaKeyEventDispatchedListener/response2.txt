Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control levels of similar APIs and their sink code entries to determine the appropriate access control level for the `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` method.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `removeOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9253 and an access control level of NONE.
2. `addOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8908 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
3. `addOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8790 and an access control level of NONE.
4. `dispatchMediaKeyEvent`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7604 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
5. `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7574 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

The sink code entries for these APIs show that they all interact with the `IBinder` class and perform operations such as adding or removing listeners, linking or unlinking death recipients, and checking package names.

Considering the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, we can observe that:

* The `removeOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener` and `addOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` APIs have an access control level of NONE, indicating that they do not require any special permissions or restrictions.
* The `addOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener`, `dispatchMediaKeyEvent`, and `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their sink code entries, it appears that the `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` method is more closely related to the `removeOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener` and `addOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` APIs, which have an access control level of NONE.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of NONE to the `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is informed by the similarities between the APIs and their sink code entries, as well as the general principle that removing a listener is typically less sensitive than adding one or performing other operations that require system or signature-level permissions.
