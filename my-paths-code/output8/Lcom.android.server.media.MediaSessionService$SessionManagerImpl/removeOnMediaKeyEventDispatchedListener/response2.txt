Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` method.

The method has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them involve removing a listener and unlinking it from death. The sink code snippets also show similar operations.

When comparing this method to the similar APIs provided, we notice that they have a high similarity score (above 0.9) and are also related to removing listeners. These similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`.

Given the similarities in the code and the access control levels of the comparable APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeOnMediaKeyEventDispatchedListener` method should also have an access control level of `NONE`. This is because the method does not seem to perform any sensitive operations that would require a higher access control level.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
