Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their assigned access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `isTrusted` method.

The `isTrusted` method appears to be checking if a notification listener is enabled for a specific user and package. This functionality seems to be related to managing notifications and accessing sensitive information about the device's users.

Looking at the similar APIs provided, they all seem to be related to managing device presence, accounts, or notifications, and they all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these APIs require a system or signature-level permission to access sensitive information or perform actions that could potentially impact the device's security or functionality.

Given the similarities between the `isTrusted` method and these other APIs, I believe it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `isTrusted` method as well. This would ensure that only system-level components or applications with the necessary signature-level permissions can access this functionality.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the analysis of similar APIs and their assigned access control levels, as well as the functionality and potential security implications of the `isTrusted` method.
