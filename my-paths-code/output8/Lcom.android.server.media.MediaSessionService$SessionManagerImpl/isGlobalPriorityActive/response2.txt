To determine the access control level for the `isGlobalPriorityActive` method in the `MediaSessionService$SessionManagerImpl` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

The `isGlobalPriorityActive` method seems to be related to media sessions and their priorities. It checks if a global priority session is active or not. The method does not appear to modify any data but rather returns a boolean value indicating the status of the global priority session.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `isHigherPriority(Landroid/media/tv/tunerresourcemanager/ResourceClientProfile;Landroid/media/tv/tunerresourcemanager/ResourceClientProfile;)Z` in `TunerResourceManagerService$BinderService` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method is related to comparing priorities, which might require system or signature-level permission due to its potential impact on resource management.

2. `getSessions(Landroid/content/ComponentName;I)Ljava/util/List;` in `MediaSessionService$SessionManagerImpl` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method retrieves a list of sessions, which could be sensitive information and thus requires higher access control.

3. `isServiceSupported(ILcom/android/internal/os/IResultReceiver;)V` in `AutofillManagerService$AutoFillManagerServiceStub` has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it does not require specific permissions to check if a service is supported.

4. `setSessionPolicies(Landroid/media/session/MediaSession$Token;I)V` in `MediaSessionService$SessionManagerImpl` and `getRemoteSessions(Landroid/media/IMediaRouter2Manager;)Ljava/util/List;` in `MediaRouterService` both have an access control level of `NONE`. These methods are involved in setting policies for sessions and getting remote sessions, respectively. The lack of strict access control might be because these operations are either not as sensitive or are managed through other means.

Given the nature of `isGlobalPriorityActive`, which is a getter method that does not modify data but only returns information about the state of a global priority session, it's reasonable to consider its sensitivity and potential impact. Since it's related to media sessions and their priorities, similar to `getSessions` which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, one might initially think it should have a higher access control level. However, considering it's a read operation (getter) and does not directly modify sensitive data or settings, its sensitivity is lower compared to methods that actively change system states or manage resources.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the principle that getter methods generally require less restrictive access control than setter methods, and considering the similarities with other APIs, the `isGlobalPriorityActive` method could be assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`. This reflects its role in providing information without directly altering system states or sensitive data.
