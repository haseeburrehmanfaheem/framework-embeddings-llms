To determine the access control level for the `removeSession2TokensListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all essentially perform the same operation: removing a listener from a list of session 2 tokens listeners and unlinking it to death. This suggests that the method is primarily concerned with managing listeners.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippet provided focuses on finding the index of a session 2 tokens listener, removing it from the list, and then unlinking it to death. This operation does not seem to involve sensitive data or actions that could compromise system security directly.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `removeSessionsListener`: This method has an access control level of `NONE` and performs a similar operation (removing a listener). The similarity score is high (0.8791733980178833), indicating that the two methods share significant functionality.
   - `addSession2TokensListener`: Also with an access control level of `NONE`, this method adds a session 2 tokens listener. Although it's an addition rather than removal, its similarity score (0.8616252541542053) suggests that adding or removing listeners might be considered under the same access control umbrella.

Given these points:

- The operation performed by `removeSession2TokensListener` does not seem to directly impact system security or sensitive data.
- Similar APIs (`removeSessionsListener` and `addSession2TokensListener`) have an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that managing listeners might not require elevated permissions.

Therefore, considering the functionality and the similarity with other APIs that manage listeners without requiring special permissions, the most appropriate access control level for `removeSession2TokensListener` would be `NONE`.
