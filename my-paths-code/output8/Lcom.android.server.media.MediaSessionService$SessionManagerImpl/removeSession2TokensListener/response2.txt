Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `removeSession2TokensListener` method.

The `removeSession2TokensListener` method is used to remove a listener from the list of session 2 tokens listeners. The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them ultimately lead to the removal of the listener from the list.

The similar APIs provided have varying access control levels:

* `removeSessionsListener`: NONE
* `addSession2TokensListener`: NONE
* `addSessionsListener`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `unregisterSessionListener`: NONE
* `addOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener`: SYS_OR_SIG

After analyzing the similarities and differences between these APIs, I notice that:

* The `removeSession2TokensListener` method is similar to `removeSessionsListener`, which has an access control level of NONE.
* The `addSession2TokensListener` method, which is the counterpart to `removeSession2TokensListener`, also has an access control level of NONE.
* The other APIs with SYS_OR_SIG access control levels (`addSessionsListener` and `addOnMediaKeyEventSessionChangedListener`) seem to be related to adding listeners or registering sessions, which may require higher security restrictions.

Considering these points, I conclude that the `removeSession2TokensListener` method should have an access control level of NONE. This is because removing a listener from the list does not pose a significant security risk, and the method's functionality is similar to other APIs with NONE access control levels.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
