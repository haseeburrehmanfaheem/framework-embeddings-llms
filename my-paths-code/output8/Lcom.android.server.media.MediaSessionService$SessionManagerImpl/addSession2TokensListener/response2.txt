Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `addSession2TokensListener` method.

The method is adding a listener to a list of session 2 tokens listeners. The similar APIs provided are `removeSession2TokensListener`, which have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that adding or removing a listener does not require any specific permissions or access control.

Additionally, the code snippets for the `addSession2TokensListener` method do not show any explicit permission checks or access control mechanisms. The method is simply adding a new listener to the list after checking if the listener is not null and if it's not already in the list.

The sink code provided also does not indicate any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and the code snippets, I conclude that the access control level for the `addSession2TokensListener` method should be `NONE`.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```
