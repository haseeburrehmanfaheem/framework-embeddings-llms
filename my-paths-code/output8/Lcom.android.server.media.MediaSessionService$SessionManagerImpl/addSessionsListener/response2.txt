To determine the access control level for the `addSessionsListener` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `addSessionsListener` API has three paths with different depths. All paths involve the following key steps:

1. Checking if the listener (`p1`) is not null.
2. Getting the calling PID and UID using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`.
3. Clearing the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`.
4. Creating a new `MediaSessionService$SessionsListenerRecord` object and adding it to the list of sessions listeners.

The sink code snippets provided show that the API is interacting with the `MediaSessionService$SessionsListenerRecord` class and the `mSessionsListeners` list, which suggests that it is modifying the internal state of the `MediaSessionService` class.

Comparing this API with the similar APIs provided:

* The `getSessions` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and involves handling incoming users using `MediaSessionService$SessionManagerImpl.handleIncomingUser`.
* The `createSession` API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and involves handling incoming users using `handleIncomingUser`.

Both similar APIs have a higher access control level due to their interaction with sensitive system components and the need to handle incoming users.

Given the similarities in code structure and the interaction with internal system components, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `addSessionsListener` API. This is because the API is modifying the internal state of the `MediaSessionService` class and interacting with sensitive system components, which requires a higher level of access control.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
