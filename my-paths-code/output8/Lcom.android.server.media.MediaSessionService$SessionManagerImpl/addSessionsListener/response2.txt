Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `addSessionsListener` API.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to media sessions, TV interactive app management, and notification handling, which suggests that they deal with sensitive functionality that requires elevated permissions.

The `addSessionsListener` API is also related to media sessions, as it adds a listener for active sessions. This functionality could potentially allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information about the system's media sessions, such as the currently playing media or the session's metadata.

Given the similarities between the `addSessionsListener` API and the other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, I believe that it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `addSessionsListener`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `addSessionsListener` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This assignment reflects the potential sensitivity of the media session information and the need for elevated permissions to access this functionality.
