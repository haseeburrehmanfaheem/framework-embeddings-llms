Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `isOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier` method.

The method is used to check if OEM unlock is allowed by the carrier. This functionality seems to be related to device security and OEM locking mechanisms. The similar APIs provided also interact with OEM locking mechanisms and have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access or modify sensitive data.

Given the similarities in functionality and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I believe that the `isOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier` method should also have a relatively high access control level. Since it's a getter method, it's likely that the access control level should be lower than or equal to the corresponding setter methods.

Considering these factors, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `isOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier` method, as it is consistent with the access control levels of similar APIs and reflects the sensitive nature of device security and OEM locking mechanisms.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
