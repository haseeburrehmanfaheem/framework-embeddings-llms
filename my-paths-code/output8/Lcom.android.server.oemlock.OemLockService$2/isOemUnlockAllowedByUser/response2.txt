To determine the access control level for the `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method checks if OEM unlock is allowed by the user.
   - It uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v2)` to manage the calling identity, which suggests it's dealing with sensitive operations that require careful handling of permissions and identities.
   - The core operation is delegated to `OemLock`'s `isOemUnlockAllowedByDevice()`, indicating it's querying a device-level setting regarding OEM unlock.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `isOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method interacts with carrier-specific settings for OEM unlocking, suggesting that such operations are restricted to system or signature-level permissions due to their sensitive nature.
   - `isOemUnlockAllowed()` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It checks both carrier and device settings for OEM unlock allowance and can force OEM unlock enabled, indicating a high level of sensitivity and the need for restricted access.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given that both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their interaction with sensitive device and carrier settings, it's logical to infer that operations related to checking or modifying OEM unlock settings are considered sensitive.
   - The `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method, while specifically focused on user allowance for OEM unlocking, still deals with a sensitive aspect of device security (OEM unlocking) which could potentially be used to bypass security features or compromise the device's integrity.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the sensitivity of operations related to OEM unlocking and the need to protect device integrity, assigning an access control level that reflects the potential risks and the need for restricted access is necessary.
   - The method does not seem to pose as significant a risk as those that can force changes (like `isOemUnlockAllowed()`), but it still deals with sensitive information regarding device security settings.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate access control level for `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the levels assigned to similar APIs that deal with sensitive OEM unlock settings. This ensures that only system-level or signature-verified applications can access this information, protecting device security and integrity.
