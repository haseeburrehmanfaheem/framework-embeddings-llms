To assign an access control level to the `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method, we need to consider its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The provided API has similarities with several other methods, including `isOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier()`, `isOemUnlockAllowed()`, `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser(Z)V`, `getLockName()`, and `getOemUnlockEnabled()`. All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Access Control Level of Similar APIs**: Since all the similar APIs provided have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it suggests that operations related to OEM unlock status are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permissions.

3. **Semantics of the API**: The `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method checks if the user has allowed OEM unlocking. This operation involves checking the device's state regarding a security-critical feature (OEM unlocking), which can potentially compromise the device's security if not properly restricted.

4. **Getter vs. Setter Methods**: It's worth noting that while setter methods for similar operations (`setOemUnlockAllowedByUser`) require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, getter methods like `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` might be considered less sensitive since they only read the state without modifying it. However, given the context of OEM unlocking being a security-sensitive feature, even reading its status could be restricted to prevent unauthorized parties from determining the device's security posture.

Considering these points, despite the general principle that getter methods may have lower access control requirements than their corresponding setter methods, the sensitive nature of OEM unlock information and the consistent `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level among similar APIs suggest that `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` should also be restricted to `SYS_OR_SIG` to maintain consistency in security policy regarding OEM unlocking features.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the principle of maintaining a consistent and secure access control strategy for sensitive device features like OEM unlocking:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
