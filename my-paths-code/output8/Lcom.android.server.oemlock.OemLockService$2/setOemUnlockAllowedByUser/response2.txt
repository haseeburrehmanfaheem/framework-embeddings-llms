Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their access control levels, I will analyze the `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method to determine its appropriate access control level.

The `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method is used to set whether OEM unlock is allowed by the user. This method interacts with sensitive data and functionality related to device security and OEM unlocking. 

Looking at the similar APIs provided, we can see that:

- `isOemUnlockAllowed()Z`, `isOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier()Z`, `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser()Z`, and `setOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier(Z[B)V` all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods, which are related to checking or setting OEM unlock status, require a high level of access control due to their impact on device security.

- `getOemUnlockEnabled()Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that even reading the OEM unlock status requires significant access control.

Given this information and considering the principles of Android access control, where writing data usually poses a greater security risk than reading it, the `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method should have at least the same level of access control as the getter methods related to OEM unlock status. Since all similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the sensitive nature of setting OEM unlock allowed by user, it is reasonable to conclude that `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser` should also have a high access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the method's functionality, its interaction with sensitive device security features, and the access control levels of similar APIs, I determine that the appropriate access control level for `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser` is `SYS_OR_SIG`.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
