To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs with their assigned access control levels.

The provided `onReceive` method has the following characteristics:
- It takes a `Context` and an `Intent` as parameters.
- Inside the method, it creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor, and then calls the `start()` method on this instance.

The sink code provided is essentially the same as the body of the `onReceive` method:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```

Given similar APIs with their access control levels:
- Two similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE`. Their code snippets are nearly identical to the one provided for the `onReceive` method, involving the creation and starting of a `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` instance.

Based on this analysis, since both similar APIs have been assigned an access control level of `NONE`, and considering that the code snippet and sink code of the `onReceive` method are functionally equivalent to these similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `onReceive` method should also be assigned an access control level of `NONE`.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
