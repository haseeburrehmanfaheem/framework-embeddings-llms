Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that follow the positive rules, and considering this is a small API, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink.

Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "public int getInterfaceVersion(){",
            "return 1;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

However, given that this method simply returns a constant value and does not involve any sensitive data or operations, it can be considered as having low sensitivity. If there were other paths with more complex operations, they would likely be ranked higher in terms of sensitivity. But since this is the only provided path, it stands alone in the output.
