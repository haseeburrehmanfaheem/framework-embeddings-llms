To determine the access control level for the `onConnectEvent` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `onConnectEvent` method interacts with network metrics, network capabilities, and transport types. It also updates the `mNetworkMetrics` map and notifies event callbacks. The method's code is complex, with multiple conditional statements and nested logic.

Comparing the `onConnectEvent` method with the similar APIs:

1. `onDnsEvent`: This API has a similarity score of 0.9841553568840027 and an access control level of NONE. The `onDnsEvent` method also interacts with network metrics, network capabilities, and updates the `mNetworkMetrics` map.
2. `onTcpSocketStatsEvent`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8980134129524231 and an access control level of NONE. The `onTcpSocketStatsEvent` method collects pending metrics snapshots and updates the `pendingSummary` field.

Based on the similarities between the `onConnectEvent` method and the provided APIs, it appears that the `onConnectEvent` method does not require any sensitive permissions or access to restricted data. The method's interactions with network metrics and capabilities are similar to those of the `onDnsEvent` and `onTcpSocketStatsEvent` methods, which have an access control level of NONE.

Therefore, considering the similarities and the semantics of the `onConnectEvent` method, I conclude that its access control level should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision is based on the fact that the `onConnectEvent` method does not seem to require any sensitive permissions or access to restricted data, and its interactions with network metrics and capabilities are similar to those of other APIs with an access control level of NONE.
