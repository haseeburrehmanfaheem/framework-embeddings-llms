To determine the access control level for the `onConnectEvent` method, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The most similar APIs (`onDnsEvent` and `onTcpSocketStatsEvent`) have an access control level of `NONE`. This suggests that the operations performed by these methods do not require significant restrictions.
   - Other similar APIs (`addNetdEventCallback`, `startWatchlistLogging`, and `stopWatchlistLogging`) have a higher access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions. However, these methods seem to be more related to managing event callbacks and logging rather than directly interacting with network metrics like `onConnectEvent`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code entries for `onConnectEvent` involve getting and updating network metrics, which seems to be an operation that doesn't necessarily require high-level access control since it's more about monitoring and less about making critical system changes.

3. **Method Semantics**:
   - The method `onConnectEvent` appears to handle events related to network connections, updating metrics, and potentially notifying callbacks. This functionality is crucial for network management but does not inherently suggest a need for dangerous or system-level access control.

4. **Access Control Principles**:
   - Given that the method is involved in handling network events and updating metrics, which is less sensitive than operations requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions (like adding or removing event callbacks at a system level), it's reasonable to conclude that `onConnectEvent` does not require the highest levels of access control.
   - The principle that reading data (e.g., getting network metrics) is generally less sensitive than writing data (e.g., updating network metrics) also supports assigning a lower access control level.

Based on these considerations, and given that similar methods (`onDnsEvent` and `onTcpSocketStatsEvent`) have an access control level of `NONE`, it's logical to assign the same level to `onConnectEvent`. This is because all these methods seem to be involved in monitoring or updating network-related metrics without requiring system-level permissions.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```

This decision reflects the method's role in network event handling and metric updates, which aligns with other similar APIs that do not require high access control levels.
