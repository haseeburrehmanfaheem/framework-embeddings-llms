To determine the access control level for the `onWakeupEvent` method, let's analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar API, `reportTrackChangeEvent`, which has an access control level of `NONE`.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - All three paths (depths 2, 1, and 0) involve creating a new `WakeupEvent` object and setting its properties based on the method parameters.
   - They also involve logging or writing statistics using `FrameworkStatsLog.write` or `StatsLog.write`, which suggests interaction with system logs or metrics.

2. **Similar API Comparison**:
   - The similar API, `reportTrackChangeEvent`, also deals with building and logging a `StatsEvent`. It has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating that it does not require special permissions to execute.
   - Both `onWakeupEvent` and `reportTrackChangeEvent` seem to be involved in logging or reporting events without directly accessing sensitive user data or requiring dangerous permissions.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: No special permissions are required. This seems applicable given the nature of the method, which is primarily logging or statistical.
   - `NORMAL`: Requires normal permissions, which might be necessary if the method accesses external storage, contacts, etc., not directly indicated here.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Involves sensitive operations like location access, camera, microphone, etc. The provided code does not suggest such operations.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Typically for system or signature-level permissions, which are more restrictive and usually not applicable to logging/statistics methods unless they directly interact with system settings or sensitive data in a way that requires such permissions.

Given the analysis:
- The method primarily deals with logging/writing statistics without direct access to sensitive user data or requiring dangerous permissions.
- The similar API has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting that logging/reporting events does not require special permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the code paths and comparison with a similar API, the `onWakeupEvent` method seems to fit best with an access control level of `NONE`, as it is primarily involved in logging statistics without requiring special or dangerous permissions.
