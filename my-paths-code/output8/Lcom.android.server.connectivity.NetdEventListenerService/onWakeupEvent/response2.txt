To determine the access control level for the `onWakeupEvent` method, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with similar APIs. The provided API is involved in handling wakeup events related to network connectivity, processing event details such as interface names, timestamps, user IDs, Ethernet types, MAC addresses, IP addresses, ports, and more. It logs these events using `FrameworkStatsLog.write` or constructs `StatsEvent` builders for logging purposes.

Given the similar API, `reportTrackChangeEvent`, which has an access control level of `NONE`, we observe that it also deals with logging specific events (track change events in this case) to the stats log. The similarity between these APIs lies in their role of reporting or logging system events, albeit different types.

However, when considering access control levels, it's crucial to differentiate based on the sensitivity and potential impact of the data being logged or modified. Both `onWakeupEvent` and `reportTrackChangeEvent` seem to be focused on logging rather than modifying sensitive system settings directly. Yet, the nature of the data (e.g., network-related details vs. media track changes) might imply different levels of sensitivity.

Given that:
- The provided similar API (`reportTrackChangeEvent`) has an access control level of `NONE`, indicating it does not require specific permissions to execute.
- The `onWakeupEvent` method primarily logs network-related events without directly modifying system settings or sensitive data that would typically require higher access control levels (like `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`).
- The logging operations in both methods suggest they are more about monitoring and less about altering critical system states.

Based on these considerations, it seems reasonable to assign a similar access control level to the `onWakeupEvent` method as its counterpart, given their roles in event logging and the nature of data involved. Thus, without explicit indications that the logged network events are particularly sensitive or could be used maliciously (beyond general logging purposes), an access control level of `NONE` appears appropriate.
