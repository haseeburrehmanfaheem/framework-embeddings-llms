Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `onTcpSocketStatsEvent` API.

The similar APIs, `onDnsEvent` and `onConnectEvent`, both have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs also interact with the same sinks as the `onTcpSocketStatsEvent` API, such as `NetworkMetrics` and `NetworkCapabilities`.

The sink code entries for the similar APIs show that they perform operations like getting network metrics, adding connect results, and collecting pending metrics snapshots. These operations are similar to those performed by the `onTcpSocketStatsEvent` API.

Given the similarities between the APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the `onTcpSocketStatsEvent` API should also have an access control level of `NONE`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NONE"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the similar APIs with high similarity scores have an access control level of `NONE`, and the operations performed by the `onTcpSocketStatsEvent` API are similar to those performed by the similar APIs.
