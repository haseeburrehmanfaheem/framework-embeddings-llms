Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, it appears that the `setOverridesForTest` method in the `PlatformCompat` class is related to compatibility changes and overrides for Android applications.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs are involved in managing compatibility changes, enabling or disabling target SDK changes, and adding package overrides.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `setOverridesForTest` method, it is reasonable to conclude that this method also requires a similar level of access control. The method is modifying compatibility overrides, which could potentially impact the behavior of applications on the system.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setOverridesForTest` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
