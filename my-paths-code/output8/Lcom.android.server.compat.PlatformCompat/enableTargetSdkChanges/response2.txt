To determine the access control level for the `enableTargetSdkChanges` method in the `PlatformCompat` class, we need to analyze the provided information, including the code snippets of the method and similar APIs with their assigned access control levels.

The `enableTargetSdkChanges` method is involved in managing compatibility changes for packages based on their target SDK versions. It interacts with override configurations, package overrides, and change validators, which are critical components in handling compatibility issues across different Android versions.

Given the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that the operations performed by `enableTargetSdkChanges` also require a significant level of access control. These similar APIs include:

- `disableTargetSdkChanges`
- `clearOverrides`
- `setOverridesForTest`
- `setOverrides`
- `clearOverride`

All these methods have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they are system- or signature-protected, meaning only the system or applications signed with the platform key can call them. This protection is necessary because these methods modify sensitive data related to compatibility overrides and package configurations.

The operations within `enableTargetSdkChanges`, such as adding package overrides, saving overrides, and killing packages, suggest that it also deals with sensitive system operations that could impact the stability or security of the Android environment if misused.

Therefore, based on the similarities in functionality and the need for protection against unauthorized access or misuse, the appropriate access control level for the `enableTargetSdkChanges` method should be consistent with the levels assigned to its similar APIs.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
