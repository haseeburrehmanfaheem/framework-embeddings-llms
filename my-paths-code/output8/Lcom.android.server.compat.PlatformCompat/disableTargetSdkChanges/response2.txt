To determine the access control level for the `disableTargetSdkChanges` method in the `PlatformCompat` class, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `disableTargetSdkChanges` method appears to be involved in managing compatibility changes for Android applications, specifically disabling certain target SDK changes for a given package (`p1`) and target SDK version (`p2`). This involves interacting with override validators, computing changes, and potentially killing packages or UIDs.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **enableTargetSdkChanges**: This method has a high similarity to `disableTargetSdkChanges` and is used for enabling target SDK changes instead of disabling them. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission.
   - **clearOverrides**, **clearOverride**, and **setOverridesForTest**: These methods are also related to managing compatibility overrides and have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations involving the modification or removal of compatibility overrides require a high level of access control.

3. **Access Control Principles**:
   - In Android, setter methods (which modify data) generally require higher access control levels than getter methods (which only read data).
   - The fact that similar APIs (`enableTargetSdkChanges`, `clearOverrides`, `clearOverride`, `setOverridesForTest`) all have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that modifying compatibility settings or overrides is considered sensitive and requires system-level permissions.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the method's functionality, its similarity to other methods with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, and the principle that modifying data (especially related to application compatibility and package management) requires high-level access control, it's reasonable to conclude that the `disableTargetSdkChanges` method should also have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

**Final Access Control Level**:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the method's involvement in sensitive operations related to application compatibility and package management, aligning with the access control levels of similar APIs.
