Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method is used to check if a specific change is enabled for a given package name. The method has three different paths with varying levels of complexity, but all of them ultimately rely on interacting with the `PackageManagerInternal` class and the `CompatConfig` object to determine the compatibility mode.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels ranging from `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they are system-internal or signature-protected. These APIs are related to compatibility modes, package management, and screen compatibility, which are all sensitive areas that require careful access control.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a similar access control level.

The most relevant similar API is `isChangeEnabledByUid`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API is also used to check if a change is enabled, but based on the UID instead of the package name. The similarity between these two APIs suggests that they should have similar access control levels.

Therefore, I conclude that the `isChangeEnabledByPackageName` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which is consistent with the other similar APIs provided.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
