To determine the access control level for the `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, interacting with compatibility overrides configuration and changes. It checks for known change IDs, removes package overrides, and saves changes to files.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code points involve iterators over change IDs, checking if a change ID is known or overridable, removing overrides, and writing to files.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `clearOverridesForTest(Ljava/lang/String;)V` with a similarity score of 0.8928223848342896 has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method removes package overrides based on the input string.
   - `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds(Lcom/android/internal/compat/CompatibilityOverridesToRemoveByPackageConfig;)V` with a similarity score of 0.8823846578598022 also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It iterates over package names to overrides and checks for known change IDs before removing them.

Given the similarities in functionality, especially regarding the removal of compatibility overrides and interactions with system configurations, we can infer that the `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method likely requires a similar level of access control. Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute their operations securely.

Considering the method's involvement in modifying compatibility overrides and potentially accessing system files (as indicated by the use of `PrintWriter` and file operations), it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a stringent access control level to prevent unauthorized modifications to system configurations.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and the nature of the operations performed by `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, the appropriate access control level for this method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`.
