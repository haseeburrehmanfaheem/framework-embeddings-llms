Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method.

The method `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` is used to remove compatibility overrides for release builds. It interacts with sensitive data such as change IDs, package names, and override configurations. The similar APIs provided also interact with similar sensitive data and have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the similarities in functionality and sensitivity of data, I conclude that the `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method should have a similar access control level.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the following factors:

1. Similarity with other APIs: The provided similar APIs (`clearOverridesForTest`, `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, and `clearOverrideForTest`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Given the similarities in functionality, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`.
2. Sensitivity of data: The method interacts with sensitive data such as change IDs, package names, and override configurations, which requires a higher level of access control.
3. Potential security risks: Modifying compatibility overrides can have significant consequences on the system's behavior and security. Therefore, it is essential to restrict access to this method to prevent unauthorized modifications.

By assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we ensure that only system or signature-protected components can call this method, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
