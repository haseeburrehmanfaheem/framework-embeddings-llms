Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method.

The `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method is modifying compatibility overrides for release builds, which seems to be a sensitive operation. The method is interacting with various sinks such as `CompatibilityOverridesByPackageConfig`, `CompatConfig`, and file operations, which suggests that it requires a certain level of access control.

Looking at the similar APIs, we can see that they all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are also related to compatibility overrides and seem to be performing sensitive operations. The similarities in code and functionality between these APIs and `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` suggest that it should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similar APIs, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
