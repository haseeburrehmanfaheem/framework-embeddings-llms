Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method is used to add package overrides for a given compatibility override config and string. The method has three different paths with varying levels of complexity. The sink code entries for this method include adding package overrides, saving overrides, and invalidating the cache.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs are also related to compatibility overrides and have similar sink code entries.

Considering the similarities between the `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method and the other APIs, it is likely that this method also requires a high level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications to the compatibility override config.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level permissions can execute this method, preventing potential security risks associated with modifying compatibility overrides.
