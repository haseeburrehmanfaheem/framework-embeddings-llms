To determine the access control level for the `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method, we should analyze its interactions with sensitive data or operations, as well as compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippets show that `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` interacts with compatibility override configurations and changes, which involve modifying system settings related to application compatibility. This includes adding package overrides without saving, saving overrides, and invalidating caches, all of which are operations that could potentially impact the system's behavior or security if not properly controlled.

The sink code provided highlights specific lines where these sensitive operations occur:
1. `CompatConfig.addPackageOverridesWithoutSaving(p1, p2, 1);` followed by `CompatConfig.saveOverrides();` and `CompatConfig.invalidateCache();`
2. `this.mCompatConfig.addPackageOverrides(p1, p2, 1);`

Given the nature of these operations, they seem to be modifying system configurations related to application compatibility, which could have security implications if not properly restricted.

The similar APIs provided for comparison are:
- `clearOverridesForTest(Ljava/lang/String;)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which removes package overrides.
- `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds(Lcom/android/internal/compat/CompatibilityOverridesByPackageConfig;)V` also with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which adds all package overrides.

Both of these similar APIs have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. This is because they modify sensitive compatibility configurations that could impact how applications run on the system, potentially introducing security risks if misused.

Given the similarities in functionality and the potential impact on system behavior, it's reasonable to conclude that `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` should also require a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized modifications to compatibility settings.

Therefore, based on the analysis of its operations and comparison with similar APIs, the final access control level for the `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the need for the method to be protected against unauthorized access, given its ability to modify system compatibility configurations.
