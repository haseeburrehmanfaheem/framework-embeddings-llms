Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will assign an access control level to the `getAppConfig` method.

The `getAppConfig` method is used to retrieve the compatibility change configuration for a given application. The method interacts with the `mChanges` collection, which contains compatibility change information, and returns a `CompatibilityChangeConfig` object.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to listing changes, checking if a change is enabled, and putting all overrides on release builds.

Considering the semantics of the `getAppConfig` method and its interaction with the `mChanges` collection, it is likely that this method also requires system or signature-level permission to access. This is because the method is retrieving sensitive information about compatibility changes, which could potentially be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similar APIs, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getAppConfig` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level components can access the compatibility change configuration, preventing potential security risks and maintaining the integrity of the system.
