Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs with their access control levels, I have determined that the `clearOverrides` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The reasoning behind this decision is as follows:

* The `clearOverrides` method interacts with sensitive data and performs operations that can impact the system's behavior, such as removing package overrides and killing packages.
* The similar APIs provided, such as `clearOverride`, `clearOverridesForTest`, `disableTargetSdkChanges`, `clearOverrideForTest`, and `enableTargetSdkChanges`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the system considers these operations to be sensitive and requires a high level of access control.
* The sink code entries for the similar APIs also indicate that they perform operations that can impact the system's behavior, such as killing packages and modifying override settings.
* Given the similarities between the `clearOverrides` method and the other APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that it should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to ensure that only authorized components can call this method.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
