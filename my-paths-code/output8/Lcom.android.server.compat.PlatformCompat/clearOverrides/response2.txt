To determine the access control level for the `clearOverrides` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and similar APIs.

The `clearOverrides` method has three code paths with varying depths. All paths involve removing package overrides for a given string parameter `p1`. The method interacts with the `PackageManager`, `ApplicationInfo`, and `OverrideAllowedState` classes, which are related to application configuration and compatibility.

The sink code snippets show that the method performs operations such as:

* Getting application information using `PackageManager`
* Removing package overrides using `removePackageOverride` or `removeOverrideUnsafe`
* Renaming and creating files
* Writing to files using `XmlWriter`
* Killing UIDs using `PlatformCompat.killUid`

The similar APIs, `clearOverride` and `clearOverridesForTest`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also involve removing overrides and killing packages.

Considering the similarities in code and functionality between `clearOverrides` and its similar APIs, it is likely that `clearOverrides` requires a similar access control level. The method's interactions with sensitive components like `PackageManager` and `PlatformCompat` suggest that it should have a restricted access control level.

Based on this analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `clearOverrides` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permission to execute, ensuring that only authorized components can remove package overrides and perform related operations.
