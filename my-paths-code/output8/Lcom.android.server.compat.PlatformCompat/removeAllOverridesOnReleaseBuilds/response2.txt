Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level to the `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method.

The method appears to be modifying compatibility overrides on release builds, which is a sensitive operation that requires careful handling. The similar APIs provided also suggest that this method should have a high level of access control.

The API `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that it requires system or signature-level permission to execute. Similarly, the other APIs (`putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, `clearOverrideForTest`, `putAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, and `enableTargetSdkChanges`) also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the sensitive nature of the operation being performed by `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`, I would conclude that it should also require system or signature-level permission to execute.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This ensures that only authorized components with system or signature-level permission can modify compatibility overrides on release builds, maintaining the security and integrity of the system.
