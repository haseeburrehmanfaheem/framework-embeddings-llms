To determine the access control level for the `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method interacts with compatibility overrides, checks for known change IDs, and removes package overrides. It also involves file operations such as deleting and creating files related to overrides.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets involve iterating over collections of override configurations, checking for known change IDs, and saving or removing overrides. These operations are critical for managing compatibility and thus require careful access control.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8823846578598022 with the method in question. It is involved in removing package overrides based on specific configurations and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`: With a similarity score of 0.8427711129188538, this API is related to putting overrides on release builds. It also operates at the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Given these points:

- The method `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` deals with sensitive operations such as removing all compatibility overrides for release builds, which could potentially impact system stability or security if not properly managed.
- The similarity in functionality and access control levels of the compared APIs (`removeOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` and `putOverridesOnReleaseBuilds`) suggests that operations related to compatibility overrides are considered sensitive and require a higher level of access control.
- The involvement of file operations (deleting and creating files) and the management of system compatibility configurations further supports the need for restricted access.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate access control level for `removeAllOverridesOnReleaseBuilds` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs that perform related sensitive operations.
