Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `isChangeEnabledByUid` method.

The similar APIs provided have the following access control levels:

* `isChangeEnabledByPackageName`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `reportChangeByUid`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `getPackageScreenCompatMode`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `isChangeEnabled`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `setFrontActivityScreenCompatMode`: SYS_OR_SIG

All of the similar APIs have a access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require a high level of access control. This is likely due to the fact that they interact with sensitive data and functionality related to compatibility mode and package management.

The `isChangeEnabledByUid` method appears to be similar in nature to these APIs, as it also interacts with package management and compatibility mode functionality. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a high level of access control.

Based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to the `isChangeEnabledByUid` method.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
