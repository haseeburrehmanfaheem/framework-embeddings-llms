Based on the provided information and the similar APIs with their ground truth access control levels, I will make an informed decision to assign an access control level to the `clearOverridesForTest` method.

The `clearOverridesForTest` method appears to be related to compatibility overrides and package management. The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

The sink code entries for the similar APIs also indicate interactions with package managers, application info, and override configurations, which are sensitive operations that typically require elevated permissions.

Considering the similarities between the `clearOverridesForTest` method and the provided APIs, I conclude that it should have a similar access control level. Since the method is modifying compatibility overrides and interacting with package management, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to ensure that only authorized components can execute this method.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the `clearOverridesForTest` method is protected from unauthorized access and misuse, aligning with the security principles of Android's access control mechanisms.
