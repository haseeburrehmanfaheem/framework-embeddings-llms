To assign an access control level to the `listUIChanges` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs. 

The `listUIChanges` API has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them seem to be related to filtering and returning compatibility change information. The API interacts with `CompatibilityChangeInfo` objects and uses streams to filter the changes.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

1. `listAllChanges`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8048173189163208 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows that it returns a list of `CompatibilityChangeInfo` objects, which is similar to what `listUIChanges` does.

2. `getAppConfig`: Although its similarity score (0.7916720509529114) is slightly lower than `listAllChanges`, it also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API returns a `CompatibilityChangeConfig` object, which is related to the compatibility changes that `listUIChanges` deals with.

Given these similarities and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that `listUIChanges` might also require a similar level of access control. This is because all these APIs seem to be dealing with sensitive information related to compatibility changes, which could potentially require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippets and the similarities with other APIs, the final access control level for the `listUIChanges` API would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is informed by the similarity in functionality and the potential sensitivity of the information being handled by these APIs.
