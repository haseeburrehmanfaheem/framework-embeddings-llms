Based on the provided information, we can analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `downloadMessage` method.

The similar APIs with their access control levels are:

* `sendMessage`: DANGEROUS
* `sendStoredMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `updateStoredMessageStatus`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `deleteStoredMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `addTextMessageDraft`: SYS_OR_SIG

We can observe that most of the similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. The only exception is `sendMessage`, which has an access control level of DANGEROUS.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `downloadMessage` is more similar to `sendMessage` than the other APIs, with similarities ranging from 0.782 to 0.916. This suggests that `downloadMessage` may require a similar level of access control as `sendMessage`.

Considering the semantics of the `downloadMessage` method, which involves downloading a message, it is likely that this operation requires a certain level of permission or access control to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and their access control levels, I would assign an access control level of DANGEROUS to the `downloadMessage` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "DANGEROUS"
}
```
