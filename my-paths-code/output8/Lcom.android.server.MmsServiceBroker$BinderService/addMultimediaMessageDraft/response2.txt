Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to messaging services, such as adding text message drafts, importing text messages, updating stored message status, sending stored messages, and deleting stored messages.

The `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method is also related to messaging services, specifically adding a multimedia message draft. Given the similarities in functionality and the access control levels of the similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `addMultimediaMessageDraft` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
