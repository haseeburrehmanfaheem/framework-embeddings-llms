To determine the access control level for the `getAutoPersisting` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three different code paths (depths 0, 1, and 2) that all ultimately call `getAutoPersisting()` on an `IMms` object obtained through either `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` or `this.this$0.getServiceGuarded()`. These snippets suggest interaction with a service that might require certain permissions or access controls.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API, `setAutoPersisting(Ljava/lang/String;Z)V`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to auto-persisting on the MMS service are considered sensitive and thus require either system or signature-level permissions.
   - The high similarity scores (0.9533226490020752 and 0.9275364279747009) indicate that `getAutoPersisting` is closely related in functionality to `setAutoPersisting`, implying similar security considerations.

Given these points, the decision for assigning an access control level to `getAutoPersisting` can be reasoned as follows:

- **NONE** seems inappropriate because the method interacts with a service (MMS) that likely requires some form of permission or protection.
- **NORMAL** might not fully capture the potential sensitivity of accessing auto-persisting settings, especially considering the similar API (`setAutoPersisting`) is classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- **DANGEROUS** could be considered if getting auto-persisting settings poses significant risks. However, typically, "dangerous" permissions are associated with actions that can cause direct harm (e.g., making calls, sending SMS), which might not align perfectly with merely retrieving a setting.
- **SYS_OR_SIG** seems the most appropriate given the similarity to `setAutoPersisting`, which is classified as such. This classification suggests that accessing or modifying auto-persisting settings requires system or signature-level permissions, likely due to the sensitivity of MMS service operations.

Therefore, considering the method's interaction with potentially sensitive service settings and its similarity to another method classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, the most appropriate access control level for `getAutoPersisting` would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This classification reflects the need for either system-level or signature-level permissions to access such settings, aligning with the security considerations evident in related APIs.
