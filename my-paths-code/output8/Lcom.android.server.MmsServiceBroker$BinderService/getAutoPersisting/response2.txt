Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getAutoPersisting` method.

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they require system or signature-level permission to access. These APIs are related to sending, updating, deleting, and importing messages, which are sensitive operations.

The `getAutoPersisting` method, on the other hand, is a getter method that retrieves a boolean value indicating whether auto-persisting is enabled. This operation is less sensitive than the ones performed by the similar APIs.

However, since the corresponding setter method `setAutoPersisting` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is likely that the `getAutoPersisting` method should have a similar or lower access control level to maintain consistency and prevent potential security risks.

Considering the above factors, I will assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `getAutoPersisting` method, as it is a getter method that retrieves a relatively non-sensitive value and does not pose a significant security risk.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

Note that this decision is based on the provided information and similar APIs. If additional context or information becomes available, the access control level may need to be re-evaluated.
