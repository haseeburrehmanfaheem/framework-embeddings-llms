To determine the access control level for the `importTextMessage` API, we need to analyze its code snippets and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `importTextMessage` API has three different paths with varying depths, but all of them ultimately call the `importTextMessage` method on an `IMms` object. This object is obtained through either `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()`, `this.this$0.getServiceGuarded()`, or `MmsServiceBroker.-$$Nest$mgetServiceGuarded(this.this$0)`.

The similar APIs provided, `addTextMessageDraft` and `addMultimediaMessageDraft`, both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. They also interact with the `IMms` service through `MmsServiceBroker.-$$Nest$mgetServiceGuarded(this.this$0)`, which is one of the paths used by `importTextMessage`.

Given that all these APIs are interacting with the MMS service, which typically requires system or signature-level permissions to access due to its sensitive nature (involving messaging and potentially personal data), it's reasonable to infer that `importTextMessage` would also require a similar level of access control.

Therefore, based on the similarity in functionality and the need for protected access to the MMS service, the access control level for `importTextMessage` should be consistent with that of its similar APIs.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
