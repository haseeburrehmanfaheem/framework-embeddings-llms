Based on the provided information and similar APIs, it appears that the `importTextMessage` method is related to MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) functionality, which involves interacting with sensitive data and services.

The similar APIs provided, such as `addTextMessageDraft`, `addMultimediaMessageDraft`, `updateStoredMessageStatus`, `deleteStoredMessage`, and `sendStoredMessage`, all have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods require a system or signature-level permission to access the MMS service.

Given the similarities between these APIs and the `importTextMessage` method, it is reasonable to conclude that the `importTextMessage` method also requires a similar level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `importTextMessage` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the fact that the `importTextMessage` method interacts with the MMS service, which is a sensitive functionality that requires system or signature-level permission to access. The similar APIs provided also support this conclusion, as they all require a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
