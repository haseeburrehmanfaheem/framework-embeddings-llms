Based on the provided information and analysis of similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `setAutoPersisting` method.

The `setAutoPersisting` method has a high similarity with other methods in the same class that interact with the `IMms` service, such as `sendStoredMessage`, `updateStoredMessageStatus`, and `deleteStoredMessage`. These methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

Although the `getAutoPersisting` method has a similarity with `setAutoPersisting` and has an access control level of `NONE`, it's essential to note that getter methods typically have lower access control requirements than setter methods. Since `setAutoPersisting` is a setter method, it's likely to require higher access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.

Considering the similarities and access control levels of related APIs, I will assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `setAutoPersisting` method. This ensures that only system or signature-level authorized components can modify the auto-persisting setting, aligning with the security requirements of similar methods in the same class.

Here is the assigned access control level in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
