To identify the sinks in the provided API paths, we need to analyze each path and apply the given rules. 

For all three paths, the method invocation `v13.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);` is a potential sink because it has naming similarity with the API name `sendMessage`, takes input parameters as arguments, and is invoked on a class instance.

Here's the JSON output for all three paths:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "IMms v15 = MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService();",
            "IMms v14 = v15;",
            "IMms v13 = v14;",
            "v13.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ],
        [
            "IMms v14 = this.this$0.getServiceGuarded();",
            "IMms v13 = v14;",
            "v13.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ],
        [
            "IMms v13 = MmsServiceBroker.-$$Nest$mgetServiceGuarded(this.this$0);",
            "v13.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

However, we can simplify the output by removing unnecessary assignments and focusing on the actual sink:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "IMms v15 = MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService();",
            "v15.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ],
        [
            "IMms v14 = this.this$0.getServiceGuarded();",
            "v14.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ],
        [
            "IMms v13 = MmsServiceBroker.-$$Nest$mgetServiceGuarded(this.this$0);",
            "v13.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

But the most simplified version would be:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "IMms v15 = MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService();",
            "v15.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ],
        [
            "IMms v14 = this.this$0.getServiceGuarded();",
            "v14.sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ],
        [
            "MmsServiceBroker.-$$Nest$mgetServiceGuarded(this.this$0).sendMessage(p1, p2, v12, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8);"
        ]
    ]
}
```
