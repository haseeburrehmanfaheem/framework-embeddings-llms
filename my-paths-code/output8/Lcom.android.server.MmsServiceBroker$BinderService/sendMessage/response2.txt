Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control levels of similar APIs to determine the appropriate level for the `sendMessage` method.

The similar APIs have the following access control levels:

* `downloadMessage`: DANGEROUS
* `sendStoredMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `updateStoredMessageStatus`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `setAutoPersisting`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `deleteStoredMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG

Notice that most of the similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. The only exception is `downloadMessage`, which has a DANGEROUS access control level.

However, considering the similarities between the `sendMessage` method and the other APIs, it's likely that `sendMessage` also requires a system or signature-level permission to access. This is because all of these methods seem to be related to MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) operations, which typically require elevated permissions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to the `sendMessage` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is informed by the similarities between the `sendMessage` method and other MMS-related APIs, which suggests that system or signature-level permissions are required to access these methods.
