Based on the provided information, I will analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `addTextMessageDraft` method.

The similar APIs provided have the following access control levels:

* `addMultimediaMessageDraft`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `importTextMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `updateStoredMessageStatus`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `sendStoredMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG
* `deleteStoredMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. This is likely due to the sensitive nature of the MMS service and the potential risks associated with modifying or accessing message data.

The `addTextMessageDraft` method appears to be similar in functionality to these APIs, as it also interacts with the MMS service and modifies message data. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should have a similar access control level.

Given the similarities between the `addTextMessageDraft` method and the other APIs, I would assign an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to this method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level ensures that only system or signature-level permissions can access the `addTextMessageDraft` method, which helps to protect the sensitive data and functionality associated with the MMS service.
