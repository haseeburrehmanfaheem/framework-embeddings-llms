To determine the access control level for the `addTextMessageDraft` API, we need to analyze its code snippets and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `addTextMessageDraft` API has three paths:

1. Path 1 (depth 2): This path connects to the `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` method, which is not directly guarded by a specific access control level.
2. Path 2 (depth 1): This path uses `this.this$0.getServiceGuarded()`, which implies a guarded service access.
3. Path 3 (depth 0): This path also connects to a guarded service using `MmsServiceBroker.-$$Nest$mgetServiceGuarded(this.this$0)`.

The similar APIs provided, `addMultimediaMessageDraft`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `MmsServiceBroker` and use guarded services, similar to the paths in `addTextMessageDraft`.

Given this information:

- The `addTextMessageDraft` API interacts with sensitive messaging services through `IMms` interfaces.
- The similar APIs (`addMultimediaMessageDraft`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to access the messaging services securely.
- All paths of `addTextMessageDraft` eventually lead to interacting with these guarded services, suggesting that accessing this API should also be restricted to prevent unauthorized access to messaging functionality.

Therefore, considering the similarities in functionality and the need for secure access to messaging services, the appropriate access control level for `addTextMessageDraft` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the security measures applied to its similar APIs.
