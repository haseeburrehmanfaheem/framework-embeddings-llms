To determine the access control level for the `deleteStoredMessage` API, we need to analyze its similarities with other APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

The provided similar APIs are:
- `updateStoredMessageStatus`: SYS_OR_SIG
- `sendStoredMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG
- `deleteStoredConversation`: SYS_OR_SIG
- `importTextMessage`: SYS_OR_SIG
- `setAutoPersisting`: SYS_OR_SIG

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to execute. This suggests that the operations related to stored messages and conversations are sensitive and should be restricted to system-level components or applications signed with the same certificate as the system.

Given the similarities in functionality (all relate to manipulating or accessing MMS service data) and the consistent access control level among them, it's reasonable to conclude that `deleteStoredMessage` should also have a similar level of restriction. 

Since this method involves deleting stored messages, which could potentially impact user data or system security if not properly controlled, assigning it an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` aligns with the principle of least privilege and ensures that only authorized components can perform such actions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, the access control level for `deleteStoredMessage` should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
