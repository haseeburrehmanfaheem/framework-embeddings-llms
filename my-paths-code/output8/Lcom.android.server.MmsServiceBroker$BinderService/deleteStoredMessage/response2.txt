To determine the access control level for the `deleteStoredMessage` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The API has three paths with different depths, but all of them interact with an `IMms` service to perform the deletion operation. Two of these paths involve getting a service instance through `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` or `this.this$0.getServiceGuarded()`, which suggests interaction with a system-level service.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets also show interactions with an `IMms` service, specifically calling `deleteStoredMessage` on the service instance obtained either through `MmsServiceBroker.getOrConnectService()` or `this.this$0.getServiceGuarded()`. This indicates that the API's functionality is dependent on accessing system-level services.

3. **Similar APIs**: The provided similar APIs (`updateStoredMessageStatus`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs also interact with the `IMms` service in a manner similar to `deleteStoredMessage`, suggesting that their access control levels could be relevant for determining the access control level of `deleteStoredMessage`.

Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that `deleteStoredMessage` should have an access control level consistent with system-level operations and interactions with protected services. The similarity in functionality and implementation with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level further supports this conclusion.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `deleteStoredMessage` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination aligns with the need to protect system-level services and operations from unauthorized access, ensuring that only authorized components or applications with the appropriate permissions can perform such actions.
