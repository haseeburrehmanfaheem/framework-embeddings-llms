To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The provided code snippet for `onReceive` is:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```
And the sink code is:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
The similar APIs provided have the following characteristics:

* API Name: `onReceive(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/content/Intent;)V` with Similarity Score: 1.0
	+ Access Control Level: NONE
	+ Code:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0, p2, p1);
v1.start();
```
* API Name: `onReceive(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/content/Intent;)V` with Similarity Score: 0.9965633153915405
	+ Access Control Level: NONE
	+ Code:
```java
ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
v1.start();
```
Both similar APIs have an access control level of `NONE` and their code snippets are almost identical to the one provided for the `onReceive` method. This suggests that the `onReceive` method is likely to have a similar access control level.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the access control level for the `onReceive` method should be `NONE`, as it is consistent with the similar APIs provided.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
