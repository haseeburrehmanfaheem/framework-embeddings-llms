Since the method `clearGrantedUriPermissions` does not contain any instructions that follow the positive rules (i.e., it does not invoke methods, access or update fields, create new objects, or return values related to the API name or parameters), and considering the negative rules do not apply here as there are no generic utility methods, logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, or auxiliary operations, we can conclude that this method does not contain any sinks according to the provided rules.

However, given the instruction to consider all instructions for small APIs, we might still analyze it under relaxed rules. But since the method simply returns without performing any operation, there's no data flow or sensitive information handling involved.

Therefore, based on the strict interpretation of the rules and considering the nature of this API:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that no sinks were identified in the provided code snippet.
