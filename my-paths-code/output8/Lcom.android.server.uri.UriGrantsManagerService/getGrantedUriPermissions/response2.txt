To determine the access control level for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other provided APIs, specifically focusing on their interaction with sinks (in this case, the creation and return of a `ParceledListSlice` object) and their assigned access control levels.

1. **Similarity Analysis**: The provided similar APIs (`getRecentConversations()`) have a high similarity score with `getGrantedUriPermissions`, indicating that they share significant structural or functional similarities. Both involve creating and returning a `ParceledListSlice` object, which suggests they might be handling data in a comparable manner.

2. **Access Control Levels of Similar APIs**: The similar APIs (`getRecentConversations()`) have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This level typically indicates that the API is either system-internal or requires a signature permission to access, suggesting that it deals with sensitive information or operations that should be restricted.

3. **Semantics and Sink Analysis**: The sink code for `getGrantedUriPermissions` involves creating a new `ParceledListSlice` object (`v12`) from a list (`v2`) and returning it. This operation is similar to what is observed in the provided similar APIs, where `ParceledListSlice` objects are created and returned as well. The fact that these operations are similar and that the similar APIs require a higher access control level suggests that `getGrantedUriPermissions` might also be dealing with sensitive data or operations.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the high similarity between `getGrantedUriPermissions` and the provided APIs, both in terms of code structure and the type of data they handle (returning `ParceledListSlice` objects), and considering that these similar APIs have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is reasonable to infer that `getGrantedUriPermissions` should also be assigned a similar access control level. This is because all these methods seem to be involved in handling or returning potentially sensitive data (in the form of `ParceledListSlice` objects), which would necessitate a restricted access level to prevent unauthorized data exposure or manipulation.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the similarities with other APIs that have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, the final access control level for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
