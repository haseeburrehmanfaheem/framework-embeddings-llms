To determine the access control level for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs. The method returns a `ParceledListSlice` containing granted URI permissions for a given package and user ID.

The similar APIs provided have the following characteristics:

1.  **Similarity and Code**: All similar APIs return a `ParceledListSlice` object, which is also the case for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method.
2.  **Access Control Levels**: The access control levels of the similar APIs are all `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access.

Given these points, we can infer that the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method is likely to require a similar level of access control due to its similarity in functionality and return type with the provided APIs. The method's purpose is to retrieve granted URI permissions, which could potentially expose sensitive information about the system or user data.

Considering the principle that reading data (in this case, retrieving granted URI permissions) is generally less sensitive than modifying it, but still requires protection due to the potential exposure of system or user data, we can conclude that the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method should have an access control level that reflects its need for protection against unauthorized access.

Therefore, based on the similarity with other APIs and the nature of the data it handles, the most appropriate access control level for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar methods that deal with sensitive system or user data.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment ensures that the method is protected at a level consistent with other system APIs that handle potentially sensitive information, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the system.
