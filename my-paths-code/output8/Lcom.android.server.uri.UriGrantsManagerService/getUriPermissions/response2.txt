To determine the access control level for the `getUriPermissions` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the provided sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Behavior Analysis**: The `getUriPermissions` method appears to retrieve a list of URI permissions based on the input parameters (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`). It interacts with `mGrantedUriPermissions`, which suggests it's dealing with granted permissions for specific URIs. The method constructs an `ArrayList` of `UriPermission` objects and returns them as a `ParceledListSlice`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets show how the method constructs its return value, involving operations like getting values from `mGrantedUriPermissions`, creating new `UriPermission` objects, adding them to an `ArrayList`, and finally returning this list wrapped in a `ParceledListSlice`. This process involves accessing and manipulating permission data.

3. **Comparison with Similar APIs**: The similar APIs provided (`takePersistableUriPermission`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also interact with `mGrantedUriPermissions` but are involved in taking persistable URI permissions, which implies modifying the state of granted permissions. Given their similarity score and the fact that they deal with sensitive permission data, it's reasonable to infer that operations related to URI permissions require a certain level of access control.

Considering these points:

- The `getUriPermissions` method is dealing with sensitive data (URI permissions).
- It's retrieving and possibly filtering this data based on input parameters.
- Similar methods (`takePersistableUriPermission`) that modify permission states have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they require system or signature-level access.

Given the context and comparisons, it seems reasonable to conclude that `getUriPermissions`, while not modifying permissions like `takePersistableUriPermission`, still deals with sensitive data (permissions) and thus should be protected at a level that prevents unauthorized access. However, since it's primarily a retrieval method rather than one that modifies system state or poses an immediate risk, the most fitting access control level might align closely with but not necessarily exceed that of its similar counterparts.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the nature of the `getUriPermissions` method, the final access control level for this API would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice reflects a balance between protecting sensitive data (permissions) and recognizing that this method is primarily about retrieval rather than modification or posing significant risk. However, without explicit guidance on how `NORMAL` versus `SYS_OR_SIG` distinctions are made in the context of permission retrieval versus modification, one could argue for `SYS_OR_SIG` if emphasizing strict control over all permission-related operations. Given the retrieval nature and assuming a distinction where `NORMAL` suffices for read-only or less risky operations, `NORMAL` seems appropriate here.
