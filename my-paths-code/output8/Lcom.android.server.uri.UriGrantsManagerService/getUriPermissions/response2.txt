To determine the access control level for the `getUriPermissions` method in the `Lcom.android.server.uri.UriGrantsManagerService` class, we need to analyze its functionality and compare it with similar APIs.

The `getUriPermissions` method appears to retrieve a list of URI permissions based on certain parameters such as package name (`p1`), and boolean flags (`p2`, `p3`). The method iterates through the granted URI permissions stored in `mGrantedUriPermissions`, filters them according to the input parameters, and returns a `ParceledListSlice` containing the filtered URI permissions.

Given the similar API `takePersistableUriPermission(Landroid/net/Uri;ILjava/lang/String;I)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, we can infer that operations related to URI permissions are sensitive and require a certain level of access control. The similarity between these APIs suggests that they both deal with managing or querying URI permissions, which is a security-sensitive operation.

However, the `getUriPermissions` method seems to be focused on retrieving existing permissions rather than modifying them. According to Android's access control principles, if a setter method (like `takePersistableUriPermission`) requires a high level of access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`), the corresponding getter method does not necessarily need the same level of restriction because reading data is generally less sensitive than writing it.

Considering this principle and the fact that `getUriPermissions` is essentially a retrieval method, we can deduce that while it still needs some form of access control due to its interaction with security-sensitive data (URI permissions), it might not require as stringent controls as those needed for modifying such permissions.

Given these considerations and comparing the functionality of `getUriPermissions` with the provided similar API, a reasonable assignment for the access control level of `getUriPermissions` would be `NORMAL`. This choice reflects the method's role in retrieving sensitive information without modifying it, thus requiring a moderate level of access control to protect against unauthorized access while still allowing legitimate uses.
