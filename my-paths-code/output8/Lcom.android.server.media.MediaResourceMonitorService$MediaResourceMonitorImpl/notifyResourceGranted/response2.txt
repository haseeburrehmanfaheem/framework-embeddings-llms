To determine the access control level for the `notifyResourceGranted` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `notifyResourceGranted` method is part of the `MediaResourceMonitorService$MediaResourceMonitorImpl` class. It seems to be involved in managing media resources and notifying when a resource is granted. The method includes sending broadcasts related to media resource usage.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves creating an intent for "android.intent.action.MEDIA_RESOURCE_GRANTED" and sending it as a broadcast with specific permissions ("android.permission.RECEIVE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_USAGE"). This indicates that the method interacts with system-level functionalities, specifically those related to media resources and user management.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **requestChannelBrowsable**: This API has a similarity score ranging from 0.843737006187439 to 0.8594413995742798 and is assigned an access control level of NONE. It involves sending broadcasts for channel browsable requests, which seems related to media or TV input services.
   - **startActivityAsUser**: With a lower similarity score (0.7766571640968323), this API has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. It's involved in starting activities as a specific user, indicating a need for higher security due to its potential impact on system functionality and user data.
   - **onReceive**, **startNextMatchingActivity**, and **addOnAppsChangedListener**: These APIs have lower similarity scores (ranging from 0.7394236922264099 to 0.759929895401001) and are assigned an access control level of NONE. They involve receiving intents, starting activities, and managing app listeners, which are general Android functionalities.

4. **Access Control Decision**:
   - Given the `notifyResourceGranted` method's involvement in sending broadcasts related to media resource usage with specific permissions, it suggests a need for some level of access control.
   - The most similar API, `requestChannelBrowsable`, has an access control level of NONE, but its functionality, while related to media services, does not necessarily imply the same security considerations as granting media resources and broadcasting with specific permissions.
   - Considering the method's impact on system resources and potential for affecting user data or system behavior, assigning it a higher access control level than NONE seems prudent. However, since it doesn't directly start activities as a user or manage highly sensitive operations like `startActivityAsUser`, SYS_OR_SIG might be too restrictive.

Given these considerations, the method seems to require more than basic protection (NONE) due to its interaction with system broadcasts and permissions but does not reach the level of sensitivity that would necessitate SYS_OR_SIG access control. Thus, a moderate level of protection is appropriate.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
