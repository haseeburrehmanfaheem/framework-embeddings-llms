To determine the access control level for the `getPermissionGroupInfo` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that interact with similar sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `getPermissionInfo(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)Landroid/content/pm/PermissionInfo;` with a similarity score of 0.9609256982803345 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
2. `getPermissionFlags(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with a similarity score of 0.8457692265510559 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to access sensitive information related to permissions.

Given the high similarity scores, especially with `getPermissionInfo`, which has a very high similarity score of 0.9609256982803345, it suggests that `getPermissionGroupInfo` is likely dealing with similar sensitive information regarding permission groups. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that `getPermissionGroupInfo` would also require a similar level of access control to protect sensitive permission group information.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for the `getPermissionGroupInfo` method would be SYS_OR_SIG, as it aligns with the protection levels of its highly similar counterparts.
