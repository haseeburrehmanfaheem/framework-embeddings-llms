Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public PermissionGroupInfo getPermissionGroupInfo(String p1, int p2){
    return v1;
}
```

Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules and have a clear dataflow link, we can consider the entire API as a single sink. 

Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "public PermissionGroupInfo getPermissionGroupInfo(String p1, int p2){",
            "return v1;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

However, since `v1` is not defined in this snippet and does not directly relate to the input parameters or have naming similarity with the API name, we should consider it as part of a larger context. If more code were provided showing how `v1` is created or modified based on `p1` and `p2`, that would be included in the sink. Without additional context, the above JSON represents the most straightforward interpretation based on the given rules.
