To determine the access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sinks, and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**:
   - Path 1 involves iterating over installed packages using `forEachInstalledPackage` and filtering them based on a lambda expression (`PermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`). This suggests interaction with package management, which could be sensitive.
   - Path 2 directly calls `getPackagesWithAutoRevokePolicy`, which also deals with package management but in a more straightforward manner.

2. **Sinks Analysis**:
   - The sinks provided show the method is dealing with package information and auto-revoke policies, indicating it accesses or modifies sensitive data related to package permissions.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to auto-revoke exemption and package management are considered system-sensitive or signature-protected, likely due to their potential impact on device security and app permissions.

Given these points:
- The method interacts with sensitive package management information.
- Similar APIs with very high similarity scores (indicating nearly identical functionality) are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- The nature of the method's interactions (dealing with auto-revoke exemptions and package policies) aligns with system-sensitive operations that would typically require a signature or system-level access to perform securely.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of package management and the high similarity with other APIs classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method should also be classified under the same access control level.
