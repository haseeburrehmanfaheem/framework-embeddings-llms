Based on the provided information and similar APIs, I will assign an access control level to the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method.

The method is used to retrieve a list of packages that have been granted auto-revoke exemptions. This operation does not modify any data and only reads information, which is generally less sensitive than writing data.

Looking at the similar APIs provided:

* `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that accessing auto-revoke exemption information requires system or signature-level permission.
* Other similar APIs, such as `findNanoAppOnHub`, `pushDynamicShortcut`, and `isDeviceAssociatedForWifiConnection`, also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* The `setAutoRevokeExempted` method, which modifies auto-revoke exemption settings, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that writing data related to auto-revoke exemptions requires system or signature-level permission.

Considering the semantics of the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method and the access control levels of similar APIs, I conclude that this method should have a lower access control level than the `setAutoRevokeExempted` method, as it only reads data and does not modify it.

However, since the method is related to auto-revoke exemptions, which is a sensitive feature, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to ensure that only authorized components can access this information.

Therefore, I assign the following access control level to the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This assignment is based on the fact that reading data is generally less sensitive than writing data, and the method does not pose a significant security risk. However, if the corresponding setter method (`setAutoRevokeExempted`) requires system or signature-level permission, it would be reasonable to reconsider and assign a higher access control level to the getter method as well.

After re-evaluating the information provided and considering the principle that if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level, I realize that my initial response may not have fully taken into account the implications of this principle on the access control level assignment for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` method.

Given the sensitive nature of auto-revoke exemptions and the fact that the setter method (`setAutoRevokeExempted`) has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to consider assigning a similar or higher access control level to the getter method to maintain consistency in security posture, especially since the principle mentioned suggests that writing data usually poses a greater security risk than reading it.

Therefore, reconsidering my initial response and taking into account the need for consistent security measures between getter and setter methods related to sensitive data, I revise my assignment as follows:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This revised assignment reflects the consideration that accessing information about auto-revoke exemptions should be restricted to system or signature-level components to maintain a consistent and robust security posture.
