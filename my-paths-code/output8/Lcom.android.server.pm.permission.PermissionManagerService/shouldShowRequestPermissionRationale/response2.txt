To determine the access control level for the `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The provided similar APIs are `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` and `grantRuntimePermission`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

The `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` method is used to determine whether the system should show a rationale for requesting a permission to the user. This method does not directly manipulate permissions or sensitive data but rather provides feedback on whether a permission request should be justified to the user.

Given that both similar APIs (`isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` and `grantRuntimePermission`) deal with permission management and have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, we can infer that operations related to permission handling are considered sensitive. However, `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` does not directly modify permissions or access sensitive information; it merely provides guidance on user interaction regarding permissions.

Despite this, considering the context of permission management and the similarity scores with APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to consider that `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` might require some level of access control. However, since it doesn't directly manipulate sensitive data or permissions but is closely related to the permission system, its access control level should reflect its role in the permission management ecosystem.

Given these considerations and the fact that both provided similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, which typically applies to system or signature-level permissions that are more restrictive, we might lean towards assigning a less restrictive but still significant access control level. However, since there's no direct manipulation of sensitive data and considering the method's purpose is more about feedback rather than action on permissions, it seems reasonable to align its access control with the principles guiding permission-related operations.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the nature of the `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` method, we should consider an access control level that reflects its utility in the context of permission management without directly handling sensitive data or system-level modifications.

The final answer is: 
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
