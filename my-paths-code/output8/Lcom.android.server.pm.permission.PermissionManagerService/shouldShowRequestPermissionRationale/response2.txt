Based on the provided information, we can see that the `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` method is similar to other methods in the same class (`Lcom.android.server.pm.permission.PermissionManagerService`) that interact with permissions. 

The similar APIs provided have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. This is because these methods are related to managing and granting permissions, which is a sensitive operation.

However, the `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` method seems to be a getter method that returns a boolean value indicating whether to show a rationale for requesting a permission. This operation is less sensitive than granting or revoking permissions.

Given this information, we can conclude that the `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` method does not require the same level of access control as the other methods. Since reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it, and the corresponding setter methods (e.g., `grantRuntimePermission`) have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, the getter method `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` can have a lower access control level.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the semantics of the API, I would assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to the `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
