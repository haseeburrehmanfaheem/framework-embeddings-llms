Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public boolean shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(String p1, String p2, int p3){
    return v1;
}
```

There are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules. The variable `v1` is not defined in this scope and does not seem to be related to the input parameters `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. 

However, considering the small size of the API and the lack of any other potential sinks, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink. The return statement `return v1;` is the only instruction that contributes to the output of the API.

Here is the JSON representation of the identified sink:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "public boolean shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(String p1, String p2, int p3){",
            "return v1;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Note that this sink does not follow any of the positive rules strictly due to the lack of information about `v1`. If more context or code is provided, a more accurate analysis can be performed.
