To determine the access control level for the `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - The API `removePermission(Ljava/lang/String;)V` has a similarity score of 0.8011469841003418 with `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - The API `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` has a similarity score of 0.7299057245254517. Its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Semantics and Functionality:**
   - Both similar APIs (`removePermission` and `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest`) are related to managing or altering permissions, which typically require a certain level of system privilege or signature-level access to perform securely.
   - The method `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` seems to be involved in the management of listeners for permission changes. This could imply that it's dealing with sensitive operations related to permissions, similar to the other two APIs mentioned.

3. **Access Control Levels:**
   - `NONE`: Typically used for methods that do not pose any security risk.
   - `NORMAL`: Used for methods that can be accessed by normal applications without needing special permissions.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can potentially harm the user's privacy or cause monetary loss if misused. They require explicit user consent via a permission grant.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system-level operations or those requiring signature-level access, indicating they are either restricted to system apps or require a specific signature to call.

Given these points:

- The similarity in functionality and purpose between `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` and the provided similar APIs suggests that it might also deal with sensitive permission management.
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are considered to be at a system or signature level due to their involvement in permission management.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the similarity scores, the nature of the operations performed by the similar APIs, and considering that managing listeners for permission changes could involve handling sensitive information or system-level functionality, it's reasonable to conclude that `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` should also have a restricted access level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege and reflects the potential sensitivity and system-level nature of managing permission change listeners.
