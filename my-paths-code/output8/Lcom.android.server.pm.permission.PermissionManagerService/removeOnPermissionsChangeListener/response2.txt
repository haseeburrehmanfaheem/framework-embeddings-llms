To determine the access control level for the `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` method in the `PermissionManagerService` class, we should consider the similarities and differences with the provided similar APIs, as well as the general principles of access control in Android.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The two similar APIs provided are `removePermission(String)` and `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest(String, int)`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to permissions management within the `PermissionManagerService` class are considered sensitive and require a higher level of access control.

2. **Semantics of the Method**: The `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` method is used to remove a listener that is notified when permissions change. While this operation itself might not seem as critical as adding or removing permissions directly (like in `removePermission(String)`), it still deals with the management of permission-related callbacks, which could potentially impact system security or functionality if misused.

3. **Access Control Principles**: In Android, setting a listener or callback can be considered less sensitive than directly modifying system settings or data. However, given that this method is part of the `PermissionManagerService`, which deals with sensitive permission management, and considering the access control levels of similar methods, it's reasonable to infer that some level of restriction should apply.

4. **Comparison with Similar APIs**: Both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. This suggests that operations within this service that could potentially affect permission management or monitoring are treated with a high level of security scrutiny.

Given these considerations, while the method in question might seem less directly impactful than those related to adding or removing permissions, its role within the permission management framework and the precedent set by similar APIs suggest that it should not be freely accessible. However, since it's about removing a listener rather than directly altering system settings, the most restrictive level (`SYS_OR_SIG`) might not be strictly necessary based on the information provided.

**Decision**: Considering the method's purpose and the context of permission management, but also acknowledging that removing a listener is generally less sensitive than adding or modifying permissions, the access control level should reflect the need for some restriction while also considering the principle that reading or in this case, managing callbacks, is less risky than writing or altering system settings.

Therefore, based on the information and similarities provided, and aligning with the general principles of access control where possible, a balanced approach would suggest an access control level that reflects the method's role within a sensitive service but also its specific functionality.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
This choice balances the need for some level of access control due to the method's involvement in permission management with the understanding that removing a listener is not as critical as directly modifying permissions or system settings.
