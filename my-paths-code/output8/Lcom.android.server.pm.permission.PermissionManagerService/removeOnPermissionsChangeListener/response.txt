Since this method does not follow any of the positive rules and only contains a return statement, it can be considered as having no sinks. The method invocation `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener` itself is not a sink because it doesn't have naming similarity with any API parameters or return values, nor does it create new objects or access/modify fields that are used in other potential sinks.

However, considering the instruction to relax rules for small APIs and consider all instructions as part of a sink if no clear sinks are found under the given rules, we could still analyze this method:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public void removeOnPermissionsChangeListener(IOnPermissionsChangeListener p1){",
        "return;"
    ]
]
}
```

This approach considers every instruction in the API as part of a potential sink due to its simplicity and lack of clear data flow or method invocations that directly contribute to identifiable sinks based on the provided positive rules.
