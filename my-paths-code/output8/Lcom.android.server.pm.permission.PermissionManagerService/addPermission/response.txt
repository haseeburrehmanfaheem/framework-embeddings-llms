Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public boolean addPermission(PermissionInfo p1, boolean p2){
    return v1;
}
```

Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules, and considering this is a small API with limited instructions, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink.

However, since `v1` is not defined within the given snippet, it's hard to determine its relevance directly. Assuming `v1` is related to the permission addition process (which would follow the positive rule of having a return value related to the API), we could consider this as a potential sink.

Given the constraints and focusing on the flow:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "public boolean addPermission(PermissionInfo p1, boolean p2){",
            "return v1;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This represents the entire API call as a single sink due to its simplicity and lack of detailed internal operations. The sensitivity ranking in this case is straightforward since there's only one set of instructions.
