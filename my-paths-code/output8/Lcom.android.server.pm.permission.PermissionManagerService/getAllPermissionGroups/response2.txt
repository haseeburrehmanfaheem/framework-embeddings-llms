To determine the access control level for the `getAllPermissionGroups` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method returns a `ParceledListSlice` object, which contains permission groups. This operation seems to be related to retrieving or querying system-level information regarding permissions.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `queryPermissionsByGroup(Ljava/lang/String;I)Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;` has a high similarity score (0.9941756725311279) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that querying or retrieving permission-related information typically requires system-level permissions or signature-level access.
   - Another similar API, `getGrantedUriPermissions(Ljava/lang/String;I)Landroid/content/pm/ParceledListSlice;`, with a similarity score of 0.9758049845695496, also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the notion that operations involving permission or URI permission retrieval are sensitive and thus restricted to system or signature-level access.

3. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not pose a security risk.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that can be used by any app without special permissions but might still have some implications (e.g., accessing non-sensitive user data).
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can potentially harm the user or the system if misused, often requiring explicit user consent.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for operations that are critical to system security or integrity and thus limited to apps with system-level permissions or those signed with the platform's signing key.

Given these considerations, since both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` due to their involvement in sensitive permission-related queries, it is reasonable to conclude that `getAllPermissionGroups`, which also deals with retrieving permission groups (a form of sensitive system information), should be assigned a similar access control level to protect the integrity and security of the system.

**Final Access Control Level:**
