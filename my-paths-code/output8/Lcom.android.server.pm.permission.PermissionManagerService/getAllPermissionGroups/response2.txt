Based on the provided information and the similar APIs, it appears that the `getAllPermissionGroups` method is related to permission management and returns a list of permission groups. The similar APIs provided also return `ParceledListSlice` objects and have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to access.

Given the similarities in code structure and the fact that all the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getAllPermissionGroups` method should also have a similar access control level. This is because permission management is a sensitive operation that requires elevated privileges to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarities with other APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getAllPermissionGroups` method.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
