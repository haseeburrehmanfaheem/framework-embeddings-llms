To determine the access control level for the `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the method itself.

The `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method returns a list of allowlisted restricted permissions based on input parameters such as a string and two integers. The method's purpose is to retrieve specific permission information, which can be sensitive in terms of system security and privacy.

Given that the similar APIs (`getSplitPermissions()` and `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission()`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that these methods are considered to require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. This is because they deal with permission management, which is a critical aspect of Android's security model.

The similarity score of 1.0 between `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` and the other two APIs indicates a very high degree of similarity in their functionality or purpose. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` should have a similar access control level due to its involvement in permission management, which is a sensitive operation.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to highly similar APIs that also deal with sensitive permission information.
