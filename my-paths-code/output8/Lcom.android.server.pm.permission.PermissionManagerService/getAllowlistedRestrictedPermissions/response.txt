Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules, and considering this is a small API, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink. However, in this case, the only relevant instruction is the return statement.

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "return v1;"
    ]
]
}
```

Note: The variable `v1` seems to be undefined in the provided code snippet. It's assumed that it's defined somewhere else in the class or method and holds the value being returned by the API. If more context is provided, a more accurate analysis can be performed.
