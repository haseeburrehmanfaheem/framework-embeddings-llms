To determine the access control level for the `stopOneTimePermissionSession` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with different depths, but all of them involve operations related to stopping a one-time permission session for a given package. This includes getting the package UID, removing listeners, and canceling sessions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets show interactions with package UIDs, listener removal, and session cancellation, which are critical for managing permissions and sessions.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `startOneTimePermissionSession`: This API has a high similarity score (0.8952237963676453) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves starting a package one-time session, which implies a need for system or signature-level permission to manage such sessions.
   - `startSession`: Although this API has a lower similarity score (0.7904420495033264) compared to `startOneTimePermissionSession`, it's assigned an access control level of `NONE`. However, its operations seem more generic and less directly related to package permission management.

Given these points:

- The `stopOneTimePermissionSession` method is closely related to managing one-time permissions at a package level.
- The similarity with `startOneTimePermissionSession`, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggests that stopping such sessions might also require significant privileges to ensure security and proper permission management.
- The operations involved (getting package UIDs, removing listeners, canceling sessions) are critical for permission and session management, implying a need for higher access control.

Considering the above analysis and comparing it with the provided similar APIs, especially `startOneTimePermissionSession` which has a high similarity score and is assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that `stopOneTimePermissionSession` should also have a significant access control level due to its involvement in managing package permissions and sessions.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `stopOneTimePermissionSession` API would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is based on the method's functionality, its similarity to other APIs with known access control levels, and the need for secure management of package permissions and sessions.
