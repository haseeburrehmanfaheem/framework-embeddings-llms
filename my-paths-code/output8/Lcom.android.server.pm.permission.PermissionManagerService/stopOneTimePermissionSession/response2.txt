To determine the access control level for the `stopOneTimePermissionSession` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs and their assigned access control levels.

The most similar API is `startOneTimePermissionSession`, which has a similarity score of 0.8952237963676453 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `stopOneTimePermissionSession` method may require a similar level of access control, as it is likely to be interacting with sensitive data or functionality related to permission management.

Another API with a relatively high similarity score is `closeSession`, which has a score of 0.7520869374275208 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that the `stopOneTimePermissionSession` method may require a higher level of access control.

On the other hand, APIs like `startSession` and `setContentRecordingSession` have lower similarity scores and access control levels of `NONE`. However, these APIs seem to be related to different functionality and may not be directly comparable to the `stopOneTimePermissionSession` method.

Considering the similarities and access control levels of the compared APIs, it is likely that the `stopOneTimePermissionSession` method requires a higher level of access control to ensure the security and integrity of the permission management system.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `stopOneTimePermissionSession` method.

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
