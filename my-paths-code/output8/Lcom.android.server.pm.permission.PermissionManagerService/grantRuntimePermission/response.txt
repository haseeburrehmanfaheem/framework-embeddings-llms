Since the provided code does not contain any instructions that contribute to a sink according to the given positive rules, and considering it's a small API, we can relax the rules. However, in this case, there are no operations being performed within the method except for returning immediately, which doesn't involve any data flow or object creation related to the parameters `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. 

Given the nature of the method name `grantRuntimePermission` and its parameters, one might expect some form of permission granting logic. However, as per the provided code, there's no actual operation being performed that could be considered a sink based on the positive rules.

Therefore, considering the instructions within this small API:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public void grantRuntimePermission(String p1, String p2, int p3){",
        "return;"
    ]
]
}
```

This represents the entire method as there are no other operations or data flows to consider. However, it's essential to note that in a real-world scenario, this method would likely contain logic for granting runtime permissions, which could involve sinks according to the provided rules. But based solely on the given code, we treat the entire method as a single, albeit not very informative, sink due to its simplicity and lack of actual permission-granting logic.
