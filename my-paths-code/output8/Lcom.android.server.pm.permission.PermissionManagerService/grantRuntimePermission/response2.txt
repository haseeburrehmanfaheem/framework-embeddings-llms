Based on the provided information, we can analyze the similar APIs and their access control levels to determine the appropriate access control level for the `grantRuntimePermission` method.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require a system or signature-level permission to access. This is likely due to the sensitive nature of permission management, as these methods can grant, revoke, or query permissions that affect the security and functionality of the system.

The `grantRuntimePermission` method, in particular, allows granting runtime permissions to an application, which can potentially introduce security risks if not properly controlled. Given its similarity to the other APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also require a system or signature-level permission to access.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, I assign the following access control level to the `grantRuntimePermission` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This ensures that the method is protected with a suitable access control level, preventing unauthorized access and potential security risks.
