Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public PermissionInfo getPermissionInfo(String p1, String p2, int p3){
    return v1;
}
```

Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations that follow the positive rules within this API, and considering it's a small API, we can consider all instructions as part of a sink.

Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "public PermissionInfo getPermissionInfo(String p1, String p2, int p3){",
            "return v1;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

However, it's worth noting that `v1` seems to be an external variable or field not defined within this snippet. If `v1` is indeed related to the input parameters (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) or has a naming similarity with the API name (`getPermissionInfo`), then its declaration and any operations leading to its value could also be considered part of the sink, following the positive rules for field access or object creation. Without more context about `v1`, we can only consider the provided instructions as contributing to the sink.
