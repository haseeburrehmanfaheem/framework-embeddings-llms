To determine the access control level for the `getPermissionInfo` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that interact with similar sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `getPermissionGroupInfo(String, int)` with a similarity score of 0.9609256982803345 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `getPermissionFlags(String, String, int)` with a similarity score of 0.8866567015647888 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to access sensitive information.

Given the high similarity scores between `getPermissionInfo` and these APIs, it is reasonable to infer that `getPermissionInfo` also requires a similar level of access control. The method's purpose is to retrieve permission information, which is a sensitive operation that should be restricted to authorized entities.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, I conclude that the access control level for the `getPermissionInfo` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
