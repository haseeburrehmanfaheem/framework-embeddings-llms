Since there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that follow the positive rules, and considering this is a small API with depth 0, we can relax the rules and consider all instructions as part of a sink.

Here's the JSON output:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public boolean isPermissionRevokedByPolicy(String p1, String p2, int p3){",
        "return v1;"
    ]
]
}
```
