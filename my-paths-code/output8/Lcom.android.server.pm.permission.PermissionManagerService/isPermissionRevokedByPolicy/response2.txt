To determine the access control level for the `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs in the same class and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `getPermissionInfo`: SYS_OR_SIG
2. `getPermissionFlags`: SYS_OR_SIG
3. `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest`: SYS_OR_SIG
4. `getPermissionGroupInfo`: SYS_OR_SIG
5. `removePermission`: SYS_OR_SIG

All of these similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they are system- or signature-protected. This means that only the system or applications with a specific signature can call these methods.

The `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` method is also part of the `PermissionManagerService` class and interacts with permission-related data. Given its similarity to the other APIs, it's likely that this method also requires a similar level of protection.

Since reading data (in this case, checking if a permission is revoked) is generally less sensitive than modifying it, but still involves sensitive permission information, we should assign an access control level that reflects the need for protection while allowing legitimate access.

Therefore, considering the similarities and the context provided, the final access control level for the `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice aligns with the principle of protecting sensitive operations and data related to permission management while allowing system or signature-protected applications to perform necessary checks.
