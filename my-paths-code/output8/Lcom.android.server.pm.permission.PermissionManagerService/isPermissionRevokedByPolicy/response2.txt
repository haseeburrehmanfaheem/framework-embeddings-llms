To determine the access control level for the `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that interact with similar sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:
1. `getPermissionInfo(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)Landroid/content/pm/PermissionInfo;` with a similarity score of 0.8176727294921875 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
2. `getPermissionFlags(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;I)I` with a similarity score of 0.8077871799468994 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to access the information they provide. The high similarity scores suggest that `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` likely deals with sensitive permission-related information similar to these APIs.

Given this context, it's reasonable to infer that `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` also handles sensitive information related to permissions and their revocation status by policy. Therefore, it should have a similar access control level to protect against unauthorized access or misuse of such information.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege and ensures that only authorized components (either system-level or those holding the specific signature) can query the revocation status of permissions by policy, maintaining the security and integrity of the Android system.
