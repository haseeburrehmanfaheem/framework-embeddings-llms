To determine the access control level for the `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs**: The method has two similar APIs with high similarity scores: `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` and `removePermission`. Both of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Semantics of Similar APIs**:
   - `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy`: This method checks if a permission is revoked by policy, which implies it deals with sensitive operations related to permission management.
   - `removePermission`: This method removes a permission, directly impacting the security and functionality of the system.

3. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The provided code snippet for `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` does not perform any visible operations within its body (it simply returns without executing any statements). However, the name suggests it is involved in revoking a post-notification permission, which could be related to managing or altering system or application permissions.

4. **Access Control Levels**:
   - `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not affect security or privacy.
   - `NORMAL`: For methods that have some impact but are generally safe and do not require special permissions.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can potentially harm the user's data or compromise system security if misused.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Reserved for system or signature-level operations, typically those that significantly affect system security, privacy, or normal functioning.

Given the similarity in functionality and access control levels of the provided APIs (`isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` and `removePermission`), and considering the potential impact on system permissions and security, even though the method `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` does not show any operations within its body, its purpose as inferred from its name suggests it could be critical for permission management.

Thus, based on the information provided and the analysis above, the most appropriate access control level for `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` would align with that of its similar APIs, which are involved in sensitive operations related to permission management.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
