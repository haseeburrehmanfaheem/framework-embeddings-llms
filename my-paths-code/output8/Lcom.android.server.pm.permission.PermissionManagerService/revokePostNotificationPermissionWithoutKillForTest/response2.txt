To determine the access control level for the `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` method, we should consider the similarities and access control levels of the provided APIs, as well as the semantics of the method itself.

1. **Similarity and Semantics**: The method `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` seems to be related to managing permissions, specifically revoking a post-notification permission without killing the process for testing purposes. This operation involves modifying permission states, which is generally considered sensitive as it affects how applications can interact with the system and user data.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy`: Checks if a permission is revoked by policy. It has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it's restricted to system or signature applications, likely due to its role in enforcing security policies.
   - `removePermission`: Removes a permission, which directly modifies the system's security configuration. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `getPermissionGroupInfo` and `getPermissionInfo`: These methods provide information about permissions and have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although they are getters and typically less sensitive than setters, their restriction suggests that even reading detailed permission information is limited to system or signature applications.
   - `grantRuntimePermission`: Grants a runtime permission, which modifies the application's capabilities. It also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these observations:
- All similar methods, whether they modify permissions (like `removePermission` and `grantRuntimePermission`) or simply provide information about them (like `getPermissionGroupInfo` and `getPermissionInfo`), have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This suggests that any operation related to permission management is considered sensitive.
- The method in question, `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest`, modifies a permission state, which aligns with the operations of `removePermission` and `grantRuntimePermission`.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's purpose and the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` should also have a restrictive access control level to prevent unauthorized modifications to permission states.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice reflects the method's involvement in sensitive operations related to permission management, aligning with the security practices observed in the similar APIs provided.
