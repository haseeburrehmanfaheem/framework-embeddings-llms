Since the provided method `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest` does not contain any instructions that follow the positive rules (i.e., it doesn't invoke methods with naming similarity, access or modify fields with naming similarity, create new objects with data flow from parameters), and considering it's a very simple API with just a return statement, we can conclude there are no sinks according to the strict interpretation of the provided rules.

However, given that for small APIs, all instructions could be considered as part of a sink if no other sinks are found under the relaxed rule, and since this is essentially an empty method in terms of functionality (it just returns without any operations), we might still consider the entire method body as a trivial sink due to its simplicity and lack of data flow or method invocations.

Thus, considering all instructions for completeness:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "public void revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest(String p1, int p2){",
        "return;",
        "}"
    ]
]
}
```

This represents the entire method as a single sink due to its simplicity and lack of other identifiable sinks based on the provided rules.
