To determine the access control level for the `removePermission` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that have known access control levels. The two similar APIs provided are:

1. `removeOnPermissionsChangeListener`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8011469841003418 with `removePermission` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `addPermission`: This API has a similarity score of 0.7957239151000977 with `removePermission` and is also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. Given the high similarity scores between these APIs and `removePermission`, it's reasonable to infer that `removePermission` likely requires a similar level of access control.

The semantics of the `removePermission` method, which involves removing a permission, also imply that it could potentially impact the security or functionality of the system. Therefore, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `removePermission` would be consistent with the levels assigned to its similar APIs.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
