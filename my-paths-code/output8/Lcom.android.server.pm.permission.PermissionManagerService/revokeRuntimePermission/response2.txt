To determine the access control level for the `revokeRuntimePermission` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that interact with similar sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The `revokeRuntimePermission` method has a high similarity score (0.9197133183479309) with the `grantRuntimePermission` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that both methods are likely to be related to permission management and may require similar access controls.

Additionally, the `revokeRuntimePermission` method also has a moderate similarity score (0.7633307576179504) with the `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that the `revokeRuntimePermission` method may require a similar access control level.

Given the similarities between these APIs and their access control levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the `revokeRuntimePermission` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
