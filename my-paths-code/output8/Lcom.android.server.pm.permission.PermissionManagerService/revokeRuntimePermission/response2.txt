To determine the access control level for the `revokeRuntimePermission` method, we need to consider its similarity with other APIs that interact with permission management and their assigned access control levels.

The provided similar APIs are:

1. `grantRuntimePermission`: This method has a high similarity (0.9197133183479309) with `revokeRuntimePermission` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Granting runtime permissions is a sensitive operation that requires system or signature-level permission, indicating that modifying permissions is a critical operation.

2. `isPermissionRevokedByPolicy`: Although its similarity (0.7633307576179504) is somewhat lower than `grantRuntimePermission`, it still deals with permission management and is also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that even querying the state of permissions can be sensitive.

3. `revokePostNotificationPermissionWithoutKillForTest`: With a similarity of 0.7220715284347534, this method also pertains to revoking permissions (though specific to post-notification permissions) and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the notion that revoking permissions is a sensitive operation requiring high-level access control.

Given these similarities and the assigned access control levels of the comparable APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `revokeRuntimePermission`, which directly modifies the permission state of an application, should also require a high level of access control. Since all similar methods are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` due to their sensitive nature in managing permissions, it follows logically that `revokeRuntimePermission` should be assigned the same level of access control.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the principle that modifying data (such as revoking a runtime permission) poses a greater security risk than reading it, the access control level for `revokeRuntimePermission` should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
