Since the provided method `revokeRuntimePermission` does not contain any instructions that follow the positive rules (i.e., it doesn't invoke other methods with similar names, access or modify fields with similar names, create new objects with similar names or using API parameters), and considering the negative rules do not apply here as there are no generic utility methods, logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, or auxiliary operations being performed, we can conclude that this method does not contain any sinks based on the given criteria.

However, since it's mentioned to relax the rules for small APIs and consider all instructions as part of a sink if no other sinks are found, in this case, the entire method could be considered a single sink due to its simplicity and lack of other operations. But strictly following the provided guidelines, there would be no identified sinks because the method does not perform any meaningful operation (it simply returns without doing anything).

Given the constraints and for the sake of providing an answer that fits the requested format while acknowledging the method's emptiness:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "public void revokeRuntimePermission(String p1, String p2, int p3, String p4){",
      "return;",
      "}"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This response acknowledges that the method itself could be considered under relaxed rules but emphasizes its lack of substantial operations.
