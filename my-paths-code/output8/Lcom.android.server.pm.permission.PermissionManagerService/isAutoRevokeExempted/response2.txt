To determine the access control level for the `isAutoRevokeExempted` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has multiple paths with different conditions and checks. It involves getting a package using `this.mPackageManagerInt.getPackage(p1)`, checking the calling UID with `Binder.getCallingUid()`, filtering app access with `this.mPackageManagerInt.filterAppAccess(p1, v3, p2)`, and performing an AppOps check with `this.mAppOpsManager.checkOpNoThrow(97, v9, p1)`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code points involve package management and permission checks, indicating interactions that could potentially impact system security or user data privacy.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `setAutoRevokeExempted(Ljava/lang/String;ZI)Z` has a similarity score of 0.8951472640037537 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method involves setting auto-revoke exemptions, which is closely related to the functionality of `isAutoRevokeExempted`.
   - `setUserRestriction(Ljava/lang/String;ZI)V` has a similarity score of 0.794417142868042 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method deals with setting user restrictions, which also involves system-level permissions.

Given these points:

- The `isAutoRevokeExempted` method interacts with sensitive operations such as package management and AppOps checks.
- The similar APIs (`setAutoRevokeExempted` and `setUserRestriction`) both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require significant permissions, likely because they can impact system security or user data privacy directly.

Considering the method's functionality and its similarity to other methods with a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it is reasonable to conclude that `isAutoRevokeExempted` also requires a similar level of access control due to its potential impact on system security and user data privacy.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is based on the method's involvement with sensitive operations and its similarity to other APIs that are classified as requiring `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions.
