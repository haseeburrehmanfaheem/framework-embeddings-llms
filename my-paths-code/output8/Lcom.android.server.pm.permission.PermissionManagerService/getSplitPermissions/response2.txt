To determine the access control level for the `getSplitPermissions` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `getSplitPermissions` method simply returns a list (`v1`). This operation does not inherently suggest any dangerous or system-level actions that would typically require special permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code `['return v1;']` also indicates a straightforward return of a value without any complex operations or interactions with sensitive resources.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` and `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that they are involved in system-level or signature-protected operations, possibly related to permission management.
   - Despite their similarity in name and functionality (dealing with permissions), the actual operation performed by `getSplitPermissions` is a simple retrieval of information. It does not modify any state or interact with sensitive data directly based on the provided code snippet.

Given these points, we must consider that while the similar APIs are classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, the specific implementation details and the nature of the operation (`getSplitPermissions` simply returns a list without any indication of modifying system settings or accessing sensitive information) might not necessarily require the same level of access control. However, since it deals with permissions (albeit just retrieving them), there's an implication that it could be related to system or signature-level operations.

But, considering the simplicity of the operation and the lack of direct interaction with sensitive resources or modification of system settings in the provided code snippet, one might argue for a less restrictive access control level. Yet, given the context of permission management (even if just retrieval), aligning with the similar APIs' access control levels could be prudent to ensure consistency in security practices.

Therefore, based on the information provided and considering the implications of dealing with permissions, even though the operation seems straightforward, the most cautious approach would align its access control with that of similar system-level permission management APIs:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision reflects a conservative approach to security, acknowledging the method's involvement in permission-related operations, despite the simplicity of its current implementation.
