To determine the access control level for the `getSplitPermissions` method in the `PermissionManagerService` class, we should consider the similarities and differences between this method and the provided similar APIs, along with their assigned access control levels.

1. **Similarity with `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions`**: This API has a similarity of 1.0 with `getSplitPermissions`, indicating they are very closely related in terms of functionality or implementation. The `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` method is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that it requires system or signature-level permission to access, implying it deals with sensitive data or operations.

2. **Similarity with `getWatchlistConfigHash`**: This API has a lower similarity (0.7447549700737) and is from a different class (`NetworkWatchlistService`). Its assigned access control level is `NONE`, indicating less restrictive access, possibly because it deals with less sensitive data or operations compared to permission management.

Considering the above points:

- The high similarity between `getSplitPermissions` and `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` suggests that they might be dealing with similar types of data or performing related operations within the context of permission management. Given that `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions` requires a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to infer that `getSplitPermissions` could also require a significant level of access control due to its relation to permission management.

- However, since `getSplitPermissions` is a getter method and does not modify data but rather returns existing information, the principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it should be considered. This might suggest a potentially lower access control requirement compared to setter methods or highly sensitive operations.

Given these considerations and focusing on the principle that if a getter method is protected, then the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level, but also acknowledging that reading permission-related data can still be sensitive:

The final access control level for `getSplitPermissions` could be considered as `NORMAL`. This choice balances the need to protect permission-related data with the understanding that a getter method poses less risk than a setter. However, without explicit details on the sensitivity of `v1` (the returned list), and considering it's part of the permission management service which typically deals with sensitive operations, one might argue for a more restrictive approach.

But based on the provided information and the general guidelines:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision leans towards protecting the data while also acknowledging the nature of getter methods being generally less risky than setters. If more specific details about `v1` or the context suggest higher sensitivity, a stronger case for `SYS_OR_SIG` could be made, aligning with the access control level of closely related APIs like `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions`.
