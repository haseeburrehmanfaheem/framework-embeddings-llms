Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public List getSplitPermissions(){
    return v1;
}
```

Here's the analysis of potential sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "return v1;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The `getSplitPermissions` method returns a field named `v1`.
- Although there is no direct data flow from input parameters (since there are none), the return value of this API (`v1`) could be considered sensitive if it contains permissions information, which might require access control.
- This single instruction constitutes a sink because it directly returns potentially sensitive information. 
- Given the simplicity and lack of additional operations within this method, this is the only identified sink.
