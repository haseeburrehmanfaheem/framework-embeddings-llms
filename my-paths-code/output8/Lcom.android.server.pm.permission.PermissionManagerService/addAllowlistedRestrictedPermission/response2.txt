To determine the access control level for the `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` method, we should consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the method itself.

The `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` method appears to be related to managing permissions, specifically adding a permission to an allowlist for restricted permissions. This kind of operation typically requires careful control and is often restricted to system or signature applications due to its potential impact on device security and functionality.

Given that both similar APIs (`getSplitPermissions()` and `getAllowlistedRestrictedPermissions(String, int, int)`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it suggests that operations related to managing permissions, even just retrieving information about them, are considered sensitive. The high similarity score (1.0) between these APIs and the method in question further supports the idea that similar access controls should be applied.

Therefore, considering the sensitivity of permission management and the consistency with similar APIs, the `addAllowlistedRestrictedPermission` method should also have a restrictive access control level to prevent misuse.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
