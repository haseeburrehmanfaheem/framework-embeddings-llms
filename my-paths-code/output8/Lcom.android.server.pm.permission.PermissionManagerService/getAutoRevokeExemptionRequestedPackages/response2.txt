To determine the access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` method in the `PermissionManagerService` class, we need to analyze the provided information and similar APIs.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**: The most similar API is `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` within the same class (`Lcom.android.server.pm.permission.PermissionManagerService`), with a high similarity score (0.9997792840003967 and 0.9977871179580688 for its two paths). This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Access Control Level of Similar APIs**: All the provided similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Although their similarities vary, they all operate within a context that suggests system or signature-level access is required for security and privacy reasons.

3. **Nature of the Method**: The method in question retrieves a list of packages that have requested auto-revoke exemption. This operation involves accessing package information, which can be sensitive from a security perspective. However, since it's a getter method (retrieving information rather than modifying it), its access control might not need to be as restrictive as a setter method.

4. **Context and Security Implications**: Given that the most similar API (`getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages`) and other listed APIs all require `SYS_OR_SIG` access, it suggests that operations related to package permissions and auto-revoke policies are considered sensitive. The context implies that such information should be protected from unauthorized access to prevent potential security breaches or misuse of package permissions.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the high similarity with `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, and considering the nature of the operation (retrieving sensitive package information), it is reasonable to conclude that `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` should also have a similar access control level. The consistency in access control levels among the provided APIs further supports this conclusion.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
