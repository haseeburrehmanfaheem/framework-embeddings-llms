To determine the access control level for the `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sinks, and compare them with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

### Analysis of Code Paths:

1. **Path 1 (Depth 1):** This path involves iterating over installed packages using `forEachInstalledPackage` and filtering them based on a lambda expression (`PermissionManagerService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`). The result is collected in an `ArrayList` and returned as a list. This operation suggests interaction with package management, which could be sensitive.

2. **Path 2 (Depth 0):** This path directly calls `getPackagesWithAutoRevokePolicy` on `p0` (likely an instance of a package manager service) with specific parameters and returns the result. This is a more straightforward approach to obtaining packages based on auto-revoke policy, indicating direct access to package management information.

### Analysis of Sinks:

The sinks provided show two different implementations for achieving similar results: one iterates through packages and filters them, while the other directly queries for packages with a specific auto-revoke policy. Both approaches deal with sensitive package management data.

### Comparison with Similar APIs:

- The similar API `getAutoRevokeExemptionGrantedPackages` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also deals with package management and auto-revoke policies, suggesting that operations related to managing or querying packages under specific policies require system or signature-level permissions due to their sensitive nature.

Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that both code paths of `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` deal with sensitive package information (either by iterating through installed packages or directly querying for specific policy-related data), it's reasonable to conclude that this method should have a similar access control level to its counterparts.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and comparison, the `getAutoRevokeExemptionRequestedPackages` method should be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it interacts with sensitive package management information in a manner similar to other APIs that have been designated with this level of access control.
