To determine the access control level for the `isRegisteredAttributionSource` method, we should consider the sensitivity of the data it accesses and the potential risks associated with its functionality. This method checks if an attribution source is registered, which involves querying a registry or a map of existing attribution sources.

Given the similar APIs provided:

1. **registerAttributionSource**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute. The similarity in code structure and purpose (both deal with attribution sources) suggests that `isRegisteredAttributionSource` might require a similar level of protection, especially considering the principle that if a getter method is protected, the corresponding setter should be secured with an equal or higher access control level.

2. **checkOp**: Although its primary function differs, it also deals with attribution sources and has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This further supports the notion that operations related to attribution sources are sensitive and require significant protection.

Considering these points:

- The method does not seem to modify any data but rather queries the existence of an attribution source.
- However, the sensitivity of attribution source data and the potential for misuse if improperly accessed suggest a need for protection.
- The principle that reading data is generally less sensitive than modifying it might suggest a lower access control level compared to setter methods like `registerAttributionSource`. Yet, given the context and similarities with other APIs, ensuring the security of the data accessed by this method is crucial.

Given these considerations, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `isRegisteredAttributionSource` seems prudent. This ensures that only system or signature-level permissions can access this functionality, aligning with the protection levels of similar methods that interact with attribution sources.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision prioritizes the security and integrity of the attribution source data, recognizing the potential risks associated with its unauthorized access or misuse.
