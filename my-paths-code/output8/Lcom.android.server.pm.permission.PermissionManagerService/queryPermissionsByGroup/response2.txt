Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `queryPermissionsByGroup` method.

The method returns a `ParceledListSlice` object, which is similar to the return types of the provided similar APIs. The sink code for `queryPermissionsByGroup` also involves creating a new `ParceledListSlice` object and returning it, which is similar to the sink code entries of the other APIs.

All the similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access. Given the similarities in return types, sink code, and access control levels, it's reasonable to conclude that `queryPermissionsByGroup` should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `queryPermissionsByGroup` method.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
