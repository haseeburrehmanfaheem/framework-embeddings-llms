To determine the access control level for the `queryPermissionsByGroup` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with depth 0, both of which involve conditional statements based on a variable `v1`. If `v1` is not equal to 0, it either returns directly (path 1) or creates and returns a `ParceledListSlice` object (path 2). The sink code specifically points out the creation and return of a `ParceledListSlice` object.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **getAllPermissionGroups**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9941756725311279) with `queryPermissionsByGroup`. It returns a `ParceledListSlice` and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - **getRecentConversations**: Although the similarity score is slightly lower (0.9784978628158569), it also returns a `ParceledListSlice` and shares the same access control level, `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these points:

- The method interacts with sensitive data by querying permissions by group, which could potentially expose information about the device's security configurations or app capabilities.
- Both similar APIs (`getAllPermissionGroups` and `getRecentConversations`) deal with retrieving lists of items (permission groups and conversations, respectively) and are classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to access sensitive data.

Considering the above analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that `queryPermissionsByGroup` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because it handles potentially sensitive permission information and its behavior aligns with other similar APIs that are classified as requiring system or signature-level access.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
