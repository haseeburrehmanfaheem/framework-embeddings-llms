To determine the access control level for the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The provided code snippets show that the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method interacts with vibration-related functionality, including validation of vibration effects, fixing up vibration attributes, and enabling always-on effects. The sink code highlights specific operations such as validating the `CombinedVibration` object (`p4.validate()`), creating a `VibrationAttributes$Builder`, and enabling always-on effects through the `mNativeWrapper`.

The similar APIs provided have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute. These APIs also interact with vibration-related functionality, including validation and creation of vibration effects.

Given the similarities between the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method and the provided APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the comparison with similar APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is due to the method's interaction with system-level vibration functionality and its similarity to other APIs that require system or signature-level permissions.
