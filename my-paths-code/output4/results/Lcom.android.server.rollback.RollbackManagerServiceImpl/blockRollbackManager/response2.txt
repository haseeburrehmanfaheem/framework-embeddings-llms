To assign an access control level to the `blockRollbackManager` API, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis of `blockRollbackManager`:**
   - The method takes a `long` parameter `p1`.
   - It creates an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda13`, passing `p0` (likely `this`) and `p1` to its constructor.
   - It then posts this lambda to a handler (`mHandler`), which suggests it's scheduling some work to be done on the handler's thread.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **expireRollbackForPackage(Ljava/lang/String;)V** has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves creating another lambda (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda7`) and running it asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.runAsync`.
   - **notifyStagedSession(I)I** also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It creates a lambda (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda9`), executes it asynchronously with `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync`, and waits for the result.

3. **Determining Access Control Level:**
   - Both similar APIs have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` as their access control level, indicating they require either system or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - The key factors contributing to this assignment are likely the use of asynchronous execution (via `CompletableFuture`) and interaction with potentially sensitive components like handlers and executors, which might imply the need for elevated permissions to manage rollback operations securely.

4. **Decision for `blockRollbackManager`:**
   - Given that `blockRollbackManager` involves posting a task to a handler, which could potentially interact with system-level resources or affect the state of the rollback manager in significant ways, it's reasonable to consider that this operation might require protection against unauthorized access.
   - The similarity in operational pattern (involving lambda expressions and asynchronous or deferred execution) with the other APIs suggests that `blockRollbackManager` should be treated similarly from an access control perspective.

Therefore, considering the operational patterns, potential system interactions, and similarities with other APIs assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's logical to assign a similar access control level to `blockRollbackManager`.
