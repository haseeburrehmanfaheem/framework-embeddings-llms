To determine the access control level for the `reloadPersistedData` method, we should analyze its code snippet, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs provided, specifically looking at their access control levels and code patterns.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The `reloadPersistedData` method creates an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0`, which is then executed asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.runAsync`.
   - It checks if the current thread is the looper's thread and throws an exception if not, indicating it must be called from a specific thread context.
   - The use of `CompletableFuture` for asynchronous execution suggests that this method is dealing with potentially long-running operations or operations that should not block the main thread.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves creating a lambda instance and executing it asynchronously, similar to patterns seen in other parts of the system that interact with the executor service.
   - This pattern suggests interaction with background threads or asynchronous processing, which might require careful handling to avoid issues like memory leaks or improper state management.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `expireRollbackForPackage` and `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` methods have a high similarity score with `reloadPersistedData`, indicating their code patterns and possibly their use cases are closely related.
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. This implies that the operations they perform are sensitive or have significant implications for the system's state.

4. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the similarities in code patterns and the fact that both similar APIs (`expireRollbackForPackage` and `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`) require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, it is reasonable to conclude that `reloadPersistedData` should also have a similar level of access control.
   - The method's interaction with potentially sensitive system operations (like managing rollback data) and its asynchronous execution suggest that it should not be freely accessible to all parts of the system without proper authorization.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for `reloadPersistedData` is `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it aligns with the levels assigned to similar APIs that perform related operations within the system.
