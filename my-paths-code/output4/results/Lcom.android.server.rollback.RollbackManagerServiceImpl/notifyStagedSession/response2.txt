To determine the access control level for the `notifyStagedSession` API, let's analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `notifyStagedSession` method involves creating a lambda function (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda9`) that is executed asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync`. This execution is handled by an executor (`this.mExecutor`), and the result of this asynchronous operation is retrieved and returned as an integer. The use of `Preconditions.checkState((v9 ^ 1))` ensures that the current thread is not the same as the Looper's thread, implying a check to prevent certain types of misuse or incorrect usage patterns.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()** and **getAvailableRollbacks()**: Both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically denotes that these methods can only be accessed by system applications or applications signed with the platform key, indicating a high level of trust and restriction.
   - These APIs also utilize lambda functions executed via `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` with the same executor (`this.mExecutor`). The pattern of asynchronous execution followed by retrieving the result is similar to that in `notifyStagedSession`.

3. **Access Control Determination**:
   - Given the similarities in code patterns and the fact that both comparable APIs are restricted to system or signature applications, it suggests that `notifyStagedSession` deals with operations that require a similar level of trust.
   - The asynchronous execution and handling of rollbacks imply interactions with potentially sensitive system resources or data, which should be protected from arbitrary access.

Considering these points, the most appropriate access control level for `notifyStagedSession` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the restrictions placed on similar APIs that interact with rollback management services.
