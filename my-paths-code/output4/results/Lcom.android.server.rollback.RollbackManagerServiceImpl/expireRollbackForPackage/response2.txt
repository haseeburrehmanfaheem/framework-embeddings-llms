To determine the access control level for the `expireRollbackForPackage` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. The key aspects to consider include:

1. **Similarity in Code Structure**: All three methods (`expireRollbackForPackage`, `reloadPersistedData`, and `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`) create a lambda instance that is then executed asynchronously using `CompletableFuture`. This similarity suggests they might be performing related tasks or interacting with similar system components.

2. **Access to System Resources**: The use of `CompletableFuture` and execution on an executor (`this.mExecutor`) implies interaction with system resources for asynchronous processing. This could indicate a need for certain privileges, depending on what these lambdas are doing.

3. **Existing Access Control Levels**: Both similar APIs (`reloadPersistedData` and `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`) have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This level typically indicates that the API can be accessed by system or signature applications, implying it involves sensitive operations or data that should not be exposed to normal apps.

4. **Semantics of the APIs**: 
   - `reloadPersistedData` and `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` are related to managing rollback data, which could involve sensitive system information.
   - `expireRollbackForPackage` specifically deals with expiring rollbacks for a package, which could impact how updates or installations are handled on the device.

Given these points:

- The method `expireRollbackForPackage` is structurally similar to the other two methods and likely interacts with system resources in a manner that requires restricted access.
- The operations (managing rollbacks) suggest they deal with sensitive data or system states, which would necessitate higher access control for security reasons.

Therefore, considering the similarity in code structure, the interaction with potentially sensitive system components, and the access control levels of similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that `expireRollbackForPackage` should have a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
