To determine the access control level for the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` involves several key operations:
   - It checks the current thread state using `Looper.isCurrentThread()` and then enforces a manage rollbacks permission check via `p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks")`.
   - It utilizes an asynchronous operation with `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(v7, this.mExecutor)` to execute a lambda expression (`RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8`) on a separate thread.
   - The result of the future is retrieved synchronously with `v15.get()`, and then returned.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code specifically points out the creation and execution of an asynchronous task using `CompletableFuture`. This indicates that the critical part of the method involves executing a task in a separate thread, likely to manage rollbacks without blocking the main thread.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **getAvailableRollbacks()**: This API has a high similarity score (0.9937072992324829) with `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`. It also involves creating and executing an asynchronous task similar to `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks`, and its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - **reloadPersistedData()**: With a slightly lower but still significant similarity score (0.970863938331604), this API also deals with asynchronous execution using `CompletableFuture`. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG` as well.

Considering these points, the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method seems to follow similar patterns and operations as its highly similar counterparts (`getAvailableRollbacks()` and `reloadPersistedData()`), which both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that managing rollbacks and related data operations require system or signature-level permissions, likely due to the sensitivity of modifying rollback data.

Given this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it deals with similar sensitive operations and has a high degree of similarity with other methods classified under this access control level.
