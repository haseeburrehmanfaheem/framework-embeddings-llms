To assign an access control level to the `getAvailableRollbacks` method, let's analyze the provided information.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `getAvailableRollbacks` involves checking the current thread state using `Looper.isCurrentThread()` and then proceeds to enforce a specific permission check via `p0.enforceManageRollbacks("getAvailableRollbacks")`. This implies that the method is performing operations that require certain privileges.
   - It utilizes `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` to asynchronously execute a task, which does not directly influence access control but indicates potential interaction with sensitive data or system resources.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code points involve creating an instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12`, executing it asynchronously, and then retrieving the result. This asynchronous operation is crucial as it might deal with sensitive rollback data.
   - The enforcement of `manageRollbacks` permission suggests that this method handles operations related to rollbacks, which could be security or privacy-sensitive.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks` and `reloadPersistedData`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This indicates that these methods are considered to require system or signature-level permissions, likely due to their interaction with sensitive data or system-critical operations.
   - The high similarity scores (0.9937072992324829 and 0.9654825329780579) between `getAvailableRollbacks` and these APIs suggest that `getAvailableRollbacks` likely involves similar sensitive operations.

Given the above analysis:
- The method interacts with system resources related to rollbacks.
- It enforces a specific permission check (`manageRollbacks`), indicating it deals with potentially security-sensitive data or operations.
- Similar APIs, which have high code similarity and deal with rollback or data reload operations, are classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting they require significant access permissions.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's involvement in managing rollbacks, enforcing specific permissions, and its similarity to other methods classified as requiring system or signature-level access, it is reasonable to conclude that `getAvailableRollbacks` should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
