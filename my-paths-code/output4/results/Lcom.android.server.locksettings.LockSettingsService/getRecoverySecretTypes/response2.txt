To determine the access control level for the `getRecoverySecretTypes` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the similar APIs provided, focusing on their interactions with sinks (e.g., database queries, user ID, and UID handling), and their assigned access control levels.

1. **Code Analysis of `getRecoverySecretTypes`:**
   - The method involves getting the calling user ID and UID using `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`, respectively.
   - It registers a recovery agent with these IDs.
   - A database query is performed on "recovery_service_metadata" to retrieve secret types based on the user ID and UID.
   - The results are processed (splitting by comma, creating an array) and returned.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - **`getRecoveryStatus()` (Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG):** This method also interacts with the database ("keys" table), retrieves data based on UID, and processes it before returning. The similarity in accessing sensitive information (recovery status vs. recovery secret types) suggests a similar access control requirement.
   - **`getKey(String)` (Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG):** Although this method has a different purpose (retrieving a key by alias), it also deals with user-sensitive data, involving the calling user ID and UID to authorize access to specific keys.

3. **Access Control Considerations:**
   - Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions due to their handling of sensitive data.
   - The `getRecoverySecretTypes` method, by dealing with recovery secret types (potentially sensitive information), likely requires a similar level of protection to prevent unauthorized access.

Given these considerations, the `getRecoverySecretTypes` method should have an access control level that reflects its need for system or signature-level permissions to protect the sensitive data it handles. Therefore, the most appropriate access control level for this API is `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the levels assigned to the similar APIs due to their handling of sensitive user and system data.
