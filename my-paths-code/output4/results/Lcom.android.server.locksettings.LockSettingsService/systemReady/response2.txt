To assign an access control level to the `systemReady` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `systemReady` API has three paths with depth 2, but they all seem to perform similar operations. The API interacts with various services such as `IGateKeeperService`, `IWeaver`, and `LockSettingsStorage`. It also reads password and pattern hashes using `LockSettingsStorage.readPasswordHashIfExists` and `LockSettingsStorage.readPatternHashIfExists`.

The sink code provided includes interactions with `IGateKeeperService`, `IWeaver`, and `LockSettingsStorage$CredentialHash`. These interactions are similar to those found in the similar APIs.

The similar API `isWeakEscrowTokenValid(J[BI)Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and interacts with `IGateKeeperService`. Another similar API `tryUnlockWithCachedUnifiedChallenge(I)Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and reads password and pattern hashes using `LockSettingsStorage$CredentialHash`.

Based on the similarity in code and interactions, it is likely that the `systemReady` API requires a similar access control level.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
