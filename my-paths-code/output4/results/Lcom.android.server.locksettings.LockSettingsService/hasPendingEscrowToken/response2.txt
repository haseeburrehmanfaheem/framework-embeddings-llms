To determine the access control level for the `hasPendingEscrowToken` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet shows that the method checks if a pending escrow token exists for a given integer (`p1`). It uses an internal map (`tokenMap`) to store and retrieve tokens. The method does not modify any external state or perform sensitive operations; it only queries the existence of a token.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves getting an object from `tokenMap` based on the input integer, retrieving its key set, and creating an `ArraySet` from this key set. This operation is read-only and does not alter any state or access sensitive information directly.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `addWeakEscrowToken`: This method adds a weak escrow token and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves adding tokens to the `tokenMap`, which is a write operation.
   - `removeWeakEscrowToken`: Similar to `addWeakEscrowToken`, this method removes a weak escrow token and also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It performs a remove operation on the `tokenMap`.

Given that both similar APIs (`addWeakEscrowToken` and `removeWeakEscrowToken`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` because they modify the state (adding or removing tokens), we can infer that operations directly modifying or potentially exposing sensitive data require higher access controls.

However, `hasPendingEscrowToken` only checks for the existence of a token without modifying any state or accessing sensitive information in a way that could compromise security. This method does not write to external storage, modify user data, or perform actions that typically require elevated permissions like `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Considering these points and comparing with the given similar APIs, the `hasPendingEscrowToken` method seems to be less sensitive since it's primarily a read operation without direct modification of sensitive data or state. 

Given the choices:
- `NONE`: Typically for methods that do not interact with sensitive data or user information.
- `NORMAL`: For methods that perform standard operations but may require some level of access control, though not as restrictive as `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- `DANGEROUS`: Methods that can potentially harm the user's device or data if misused, often requiring explicit user consent (e.g., reading contacts).
- `SYS_OR_SIG`: For system-level operations or those requiring a signature permission level, typically for modifying secure settings or sensitive operations.

**Conclusion**: The method does not seem to fit into the `SYS_OR_SIG` category like its similar APIs because it doesn't modify state. It's also not clearly `DANGEROUS` since it doesn't access highly sensitive data that could be used maliciously without further context. Between `NONE` and `NORMAL`, considering it interacts with an internal map but does so in a read-only manner, the most appropriate choice seems to lean towards `NORMAL` due to its interaction with potentially sensitive token information, even though it's a query operation.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This decision is based on the method's functionality being more aligned with standard operations that might require some access control but doesn't fit into the more sensitive categories. However, without explicit context about what these tokens represent or how they're secured, this conclusion leans on the side of caution while considering the method's read-only nature and internal operation scope.
