To assign an access control level to the `setServerParams` method, let's analyze its interactions with sinks and compare them to similar APIs.

1. **Interactions with Sinks**:
   - The `setServerParams` method interacts with two sinks:
     - `RecoverableKeyStoreDb.getBytes`: This suggests that the method is reading from a secure database.
     - `RecoverableKeyStoreDb.setBytes`: This implies writing to a secure database, potentially altering sensitive data.
     - `this.mCleanupManager.registerRecoveryAgent`: Similar to other APIs, this line indicates registration of a recovery agent, which might involve privileged operations.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - **setSnapshotCreatedPendingIntent**: Has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method also registers a recovery agent using `this.mCleanupManager.registerRecoveryAgent` and stores an intent, indicating it deals with system-level or signature-protected operations.
   - **setRecoverySecretTypes**: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It registers a recovery agent in a similar manner to `setServerParams`, suggesting that the operation requires system or signature-level permissions.

Given these points:
- The method modifies secure data by setting server parameters, which could potentially affect system security or user data protection.
- The registration of a recovery agent is a critical operation typically requiring elevated permissions.
- Similar APIs (`setSnapshotCreatedPendingIntent` and `setRecoverySecretTypes`) that interact with the same sinks (in terms of registering recovery agents) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to assign a similar level of access control to `setServerParams`, as it also deals with potentially sensitive operations related to system security and user data protection.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
