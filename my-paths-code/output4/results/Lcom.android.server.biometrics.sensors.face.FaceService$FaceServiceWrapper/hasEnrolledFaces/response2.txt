To determine the access control level for the `hasEnrolledFaces` method, we should analyze its functionality and compare it with the provided similar API, `enroll`, which has an access control level of `NORMAL`.

1. **Functionality Analysis**: The `hasEnrolledFaces` method checks if there are enrolled faces for a given set of parameters (integers `p1` and `p2`, and a `String p3`). It iterates through service providers, checks if the provider contains a specific sensor (`containsSensor(p2)`), and in one of its paths, it retrieves a list of enrolled faces (`getEnrolledFaces(p1, p2)`).

2. **Comparison with Similar API**: The similar API, `enroll`, is used for enrolling faces and has several steps including getting sensor properties, iterating through service providers to find one that contains a specific sensor, and then scheduling the enrollment process. This API has an access control level of `NORMAL`.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - **NONE**: Typically reserved for methods that do not interact with sensitive data or hardware components in a way that could pose a risk to the user's privacy or device security.
   - **NORMAL**: Applies to methods that interact with user data or device hardware but do so in a manner that is considered standard and necessary for the app's functionality, without posing significant risks.
   - **DANGEROUS**: Used for methods that handle sensitive operations which could significantly impact the user's privacy, financial information, or device security if not properly authorized.
   - **SYS_OR_SIG**: Applies to system-level or signature-protected permissions, typically required for operations that are highly restricted and only allowed for system apps or those signed with the platform key.

Given that `hasEnrolledFaces` deals with biometric data (faces) which is sensitive information, but considering it's a check for enrollment status rather than an operation to modify, access, or utilize this biometric data in a dangerous way, its impact on user privacy and device security seems contained. The method does not initiate any potentially risky operations like the `enroll` method does with face enrollment.

However, because it still interacts with sensitive user data (biometric information), an access control level of **NONE** might be too lenient. Between **NORMAL**, **DANGEROUS**, and **SYS_OR_SIG**, considering the nature of the operation as a check rather than an active modification or sensitive data transmission, and comparing with the provided similar API (`enroll`) which is rated as **NORMAL**, `hasEnrolledFaces` seems to align more closely with operations that are necessary for app functionality without posing significant risks.

Thus, given its functionality and comparison with the `enroll` method, the most appropriate access control level for `hasEnrolledFaces` would be **NORMAL**.
