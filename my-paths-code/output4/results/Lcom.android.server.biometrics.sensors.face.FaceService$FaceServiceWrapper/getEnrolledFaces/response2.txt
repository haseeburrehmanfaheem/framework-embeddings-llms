To assign an access control level to the `getEnrolledFaces` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `getEnrolledFaces` method iterates over a list of service providers, checks if the next provider contains a specific sensor (based on the parameter `p2`), and then returns an empty list. The key part of this method is the interaction with the `containsSensor` method, which is also present in the similar APIs.

Looking at the similar APIs:
1. `isHardwareDetected(ILjava/lang/String;)Z` has a similarity score of 0.7537326812744141 and an access control level of NORMAL. This API also checks for sensor presence using `containsSensor` but returns a boolean indicating hardware detection.
2. `createTestSession(ILandroid/hardware/biometrics/ITestSessionCallback;Ljava/lang/String;)Landroid/hardware/biometrics/ITestSession;` has a similarity score of 0.7129873633384705 and an access control level of NORMAL. This method involves creating a test session, which might require specific permissions or controls but is still classified as NORMAL.

Given the similarities in code structure and the presence of `containsSensor` checks, it suggests that these methods are involved in biometric or hardware-related operations. The `getEnrolledFaces` method seems to be querying or checking for enrolled faces (likely in a biometric context), which might not require dangerous permissions but could still involve personal or sensitive information.

Considering the above points and the fact that both similar APIs have an access control level of NORMAL, it's reasonable to conclude that the `getEnrolledFaces` method should also be classified under a similar access control level. This is because all these methods seem to deal with hardware or biometric checks that do not necessarily require dangerous permissions but still need some level of control or normal permission to function properly.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `getEnrolledFaces` API would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
