To determine the access control level for the `cancelFaceDetect` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `cancelFaceDetect` method interacts with the following sinks:

* `FaceService.getSensorProperties()`
* `this.mServiceProviders.iterator()`
* `containsSensor(FaceSensorPropertiesInternal.sensorId)`
* `Pair.second.cancelFaceDetect(v24, p1, p3)`

The similar APIs provided also interact with these sinks. Specifically:

* `cancelAuthentication` and `remove` both call `FaceService.getSensorProperties()` and iterate over the service providers using `this.mServiceProviders.iterator()`.
* They also check if a sensor contains a specific ID using `containsSensor(FaceSensorPropertiesInternal.sensorId)`.
* Finally, they perform an action on the pair of values obtained from the previous steps, such as canceling authentication or scheduling removal.

Given these similarities, it is likely that the `cancelFaceDetect` method requires similar access control to the similar APIs. Both `cancelAuthentication` and `remove` have an access control level of `NORMAL`.

Therefore, based on the code analysis and comparison with similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `cancelFaceDetect` method should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This decision is informed by the similarities in code structure and sink interactions between `cancelFaceDetect` and the provided similar APIs.
