To determine the access control level for the `remove` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

The `remove` method has three code paths, but they all seem to interact with the same sinks, such as `FaceService.getSensorProperties()`, `containsSensor(FaceSensorPropertiesInternal.sensorId)`, and `Pair.second.scheduleRemove(v15, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5)`. These sinks are also present in the similar APIs provided.

The two similar APIs, `setFeature` and `cancelAuthentication`, both have an access control level of `NORMAL`. They interact with the same sinks as the `remove` method, which suggests that the `remove` method might also require a similar level of access control.

Given the similarities between the code paths and the interactions with the same sinks, it's reasonable to assign the same access control level to the `remove` method as its similar APIs. Therefore, the final access control level for the `remove` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment is based on the observation that the `remove` method interacts with sensitive data and functionality in a way that is comparable to the similar APIs, which are assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`.
