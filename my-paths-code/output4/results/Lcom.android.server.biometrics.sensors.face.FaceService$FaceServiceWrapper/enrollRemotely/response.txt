Since the provided code does not contain any method invocations, field access or updates, object creation that follow the positive rules, and directly returns a constant value, there are no potential sinks in this API.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that there are no instructions in the provided code that collectively contribute to a sink. The method directly returns a constant value (-1) without any data flow or interaction with the input parameters, making it unlikely to contain sensitive information or potential security vulnerabilities related to access control for Android APIs.
