Based on the provided code snippet for the `onReceive` API, I'll analyze it to identify potential sinks according to the given rules.

The code snippet is as follows:

```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v1.start();
    return;
}
```

Here's how it breaks down in terms of identifying sinks:

- The `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object creation directly involves the API parameters (`p0`, `p2`, and `p1`). This matches one of the positive rules for identifying a sink, specifically the rule regarding the creation of new objects with data flow from the API parameters.

The only potential sink identified in this code snippet is related to the creation and use of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object. Here's how it can be represented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
            "v1.start();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This JSON represents the identified sink, where the creation of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and its subsequent start method call are directly linked by the object instance (`v1`). The data flow from the API parameters to the object's constructor and then potentially influencing the behavior through the `start()` method invocation forms a coherent set of instructions that together contribute to this sink.
