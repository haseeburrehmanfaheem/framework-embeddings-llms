To determine the access control level for the `getMaximumDataBlockSize` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `getMaximumDataBlockSize` returns a value that seems to be derived from the device's block size (`PersistentDataBlockService.getBlockDeviceSize()`), but the critical part of the logic is obscured by the `phiInstruction`, which suggests a compilation artifact or an optimization that doesn't directly influence our access control decision. The method does call `Binder.getCallingUid()`, indicating it checks the caller's UID, but this check isn't directly used in the provided logic paths.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code focuses on returning a value derived from `phiInstruction`. This part of the analysis is somewhat abstract due to the nature of `phiInstruction` but suggests that the method's primary function is to provide information.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **isApkVeritySupported()Z**: This API has an access control level of NONE, meaning it doesn't pose a significant risk in terms of data exposure or system integrity. Its similarity score with `getMaximumDataBlockSize` is high (0.90315842628479), suggesting similar operational characteristics.
   - **getClientPid(Ljava/lang/String;)I**: This API has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, implying it requires either system or signature-level permissions to access, indicating a potential risk if misused. However, its similarity score with `getMaximumDataBlockSize` is lower (0.8663026094436646) compared to `isApkVeritySupported`.

Considering these points:
- The method primarily returns information without directly modifying system state or accessing sensitive data that would require high-level permissions.
- The presence of `Binder.getCallingUid()` suggests some form of caller identification but lacks explicit permission checks or sensitive data handling in the provided paths.
- The similarity with `isApkVeritySupported`, which has an access control level of NONE, and considering the nature of the method, suggests that `getMaximumDataBlockSize` might not pose significant risks that would necessitate higher access controls like DANGEROUS or SYS_OR_SIG.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate access control level for `getMaximumDataBlockSize` seems to be **NONE**, as it aligns with the characteristics of providing information without significant risk implications based on the provided logic and similarity scores.
