To determine the access control level for the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method, we need to analyze its similarity with other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The provided API, `onNotificationFeedbackReceived`, has a high similarity score with two other APIs: `onNotificationClick` (similarity score: 0.8196779489517212) and `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` (similarity score: 0.8190553188323975). Both of these similar APIs have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

The sink code for `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` is `this.mNotificationDelegate.onNotificationFeedbackReceived(p1, p2);`, which indicates that it interacts with the `mNotificationDelegate` object to handle notification feedback. This interaction pattern is consistent with the similar APIs, which also interact with the `mNotificationDelegate` object to handle other types of notification events.

Given the high similarity scores and the consistent interaction patterns with the `mNotificationDelegate` object, it is reasonable to infer that the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` method should have a similar access control level as the two comparable APIs.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `onNotificationFeedbackReceived` API should be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
