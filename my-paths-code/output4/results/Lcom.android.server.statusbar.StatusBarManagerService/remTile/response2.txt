To determine the access control level for the `remTile` method, we need to analyze its similarity to other APIs that interact with the same sinks and their assigned access control levels.

The `remTile` method has a high similarity score (0.8796) with the `addTile` method, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that `remTile` may also require a similar level of access control, as both methods interact with the `mBar` object and perform operations on tiles.

Additionally, the `remTile` method has a similarity score (0.8539) with the `clickTile` method, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that `remTile` may require a similar level of access control.

The sink code for `remTile` is `this.mBar.remQsTile(p1);`, which is similar to the sink code for `addTile` (`this.mBar.addQsTile(p1);`) and `clickTile` (`this.mBar.clickQsTile(p1);`). This suggests that all three methods interact with the same sink, which may require a specific level of access control.

Based on this analysis, it is likely that the `remTile` method requires an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is similar to other methods that have been assigned this level of access control and interacts with the same sink.
