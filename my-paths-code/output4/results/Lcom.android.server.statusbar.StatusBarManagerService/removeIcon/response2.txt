To determine the access control level for the `removeIcon` method, let's analyze its behavior and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Behavior of `removeIcon` Method**: This method removes an icon from a bar (likely a status or notification bar) based on a string parameter `p1`. It first attempts to remove the icon from a collection (`this.mIcons`) and then calls another method on `this.mBar` to remove the icon, passing the same string parameter.

2. **Similar APIs**:
   - **`setIconVisibility(Ljava/lang/String;Z)V`**: This API sets the visibility of an icon based on its string identifier and a boolean value indicating whether it should be visible or not. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that modifying icon visibility requires system or signature-level permissions, likely because it affects the user interface and potentially sensitive information.
   - **`remTile(Landroid/content/ComponentName;)V`**: This method removes a tile ( possibly from a Quick Settings panel) based on a `ComponentName`. Its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`, implying that removing tiles, which could be related to system settings or apps with specific permissions, requires significant access rights.

Given the similarities in functionality and access control levels of these APIs, it can be inferred that they all deal with modifying the state of UI elements (icons, tiles) that are part of a system-level interface. Modifying such elements often requires permission to ensure that only authorized components or the system itself can alter the user's experience and potentially sensitive settings.

**Access Control Decision**: Since `removeIcon` affects system-level UI by removing an icon, which could be related to notifications, system status, or other apps, it likely requires a level of access control that prevents arbitrary removals by non-privileged applications. The similarity in purpose and the need for controlled modification of system UI elements suggest that `removeIcon` should have a similar access control level to the provided APIs.

Therefore, considering the potential impact on system UI and security, the most appropriate access control level for the `removeIcon` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the levels assigned to the similar APIs.
