To determine the access control level for the `onPanelRevealed` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onPanelRevealed` method calls `this.mNotificationDelegate.onPanelRevealed(p1, p2);`, which is a sink. This call is wrapped around `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v3);`. These methods are used to clear and restore the calling identity of the current thread, typically used when performing operations that should be executed with a specific or cleared identity to prevent leaks or improper access control.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The API `onNotificationVisibilityChanged` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method interacts with a similar delegate (`this.mNotificationDelegate`) and performs operations related to notification visibility, which is system-level functionality.
   - The API `onNotificationBubbleChanged` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permissions. It too operates on notifications through the same delegate.

Given these points:
- Both similar APIs (`onNotificationVisibilityChanged` and `onNotificationBubbleChanged`) have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations involving notification delegates, which are part of system-level functionality, require elevated permissions.
- The `onPanelRevealed` method follows a similar pattern by interacting with the notification delegate (`this.mNotificationDelegate.onPanelRevealed(p1, p2);`) and utilizing `Binder` methods to manage calling identities. This implies that it also deals with sensitive or system-level operations.

Based on this analysis and considering the similarity in functionality and access control levels of related APIs, the `onPanelRevealed` method should be assigned an access control level that reflects its need for elevated permissions due to its interaction with system-level components (notification delegate).

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
