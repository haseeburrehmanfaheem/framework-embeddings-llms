Based on the provided code snippet:

```java
public void suppressAmbientDisplay(boolean p1){
    this.mBar.suppressAmbientDisplay(p1);
    return;
}
```

Here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "this.mBar.suppressAmbientDisplay(p1);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This code meets one of the positive rules: 
- It invokes a method (`suppressAmbientDisplay`) that has naming similarity with the API name (`suppressAmbientDisplay`).
- The invoked method also takes the input parameter `p1` as its argument, which further supports it being a sink. 

Note that there's only one set of instructions here because there's a direct dataflow link between receiving the input parameter `p1` and passing it to the method invocation on `this.mBar`. The return statement does not contribute to any data flow or access control and thus is not considered part of the sink.
