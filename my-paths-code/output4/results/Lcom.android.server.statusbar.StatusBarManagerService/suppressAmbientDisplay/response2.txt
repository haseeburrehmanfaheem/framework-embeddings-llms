To determine the access control level for the `suppressAmbientDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet**: The method directly calls `this.mBar.suppressAmbientDisplay(p1);`, indicating it delegates its functionality to another component (`mBar`) without performing any additional checks or transformations on the input parameter `p1`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink is `this.mBar.suppressAmbientDisplay(p1);`, which suggests that the method's primary action is to suppress ambient display based on a boolean value.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **onBiometricError(III)V** with a similarity score of 0.7486917972564697 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This API interacts with biometric error handling, which typically requires system or signature-level permissions due to its sensitive nature.
   - **showPinningEnterExitToast(Z)V** with a similarity score of 0.739648163318634 and an access control level of NONE. This method shows a toast message related to pinning enter/exit events, which is generally not considered sensitive and thus requires no specific permissions.

Given these details:

- The `suppressAmbientDisplay` method seems to be controlling a feature (ambient display) that could potentially impact system behavior or user experience but doesn't inherently suggest it deals with sensitive data or actions that would require high-level permissions like SYS_OR_SIG.
- The similarity scores indicate that both comparison APIs have some level of resemblance in their functionality or structure, but the access control levels differ significantly between them (SYS_OR_SIG for `onBiometricError` and NONE for `showPinningEnterExitToast`).
- Considering the nature of `suppressAmbientDisplay`, which is more related to controlling a display feature rather than accessing sensitive data or performing critical system operations, it seems less likely to require SYS_OR_SIG access control.

Based on this analysis and considering that controlling ambient display doesn't typically involve sensitive information or actions requiring high-level permissions, but might still need some form of permission to alter system settings (though not necessarily at the level of SYS_OR_SIG), a reasonable assignment would lean towards NORMAL. This is because it's less restrictive than SYS_OR_SIG but acknowledges that altering system behaviors like ambient display might require more than NONE level access.

However, without explicit details on whether this action is considered dangerous or if normal apps can perform such operations without special permissions, and considering the examples given (especially `showPinningEnterExitToast` with NONE), one could argue it might not need any special permission at all, suggesting a potential case for NORMAL. Yet, given the direct interaction with system components (like `mBar`) in a manner similar to how other methods interact with sensitive components but without clear indication of danger or sensitivity, we should consider what's typical for such operations.

Thus, considering the nature of the method and comparing it with provided examples, if we were to choose based on the information given and general principles of least privilege and the specific actions described:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```

This choice reflects a balance between acknowledging potential system impact and recognizing the lack of clear sensitivity or danger in the operation. However, it's crucial to note that actual access control decisions should be based on detailed security audits and specific requirements of the Android system version and device manufacturer policies, which might not be fully encapsulated by the provided information.
