Here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$10 v5 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$10(p0,p1,p2);",
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);"
    ]
]
}
```

Explanation:
- `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` and `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` are considered auxiliary operations as they relate to access control and do not directly contribute to a sink.
- The creation of the `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10` object (`v5`) has naming similarity with the API name (`powerOnRemoteDevice` indirectly through its class) and is created using the input parameters `p1` and `p2`, thus following one of the positive rules for identifying sinks.
- The instruction `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5);` uses the object `v5` created in the previous step, establishing a direct data flow link between these two instructions. This suggests that they should be grouped together as a single sink set.
