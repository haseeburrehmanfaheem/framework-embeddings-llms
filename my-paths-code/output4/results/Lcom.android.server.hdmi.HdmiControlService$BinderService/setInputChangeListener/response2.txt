Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `setInputChangeListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setInputChangeListener` method has three paths with similar code snippets, all of which include:

1. `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();`: This line suggests that the method is enforcing some kind of permission check.
2. `HdmiControlService$InputChangeListenerRecord v7 = new HdmiControlService$InputChangeListenerRecord(HdmiControlService,p2);`: This line creates a new instance of `InputChangeListenerRecord`, which is similar to the code in the similar APIs.
3. `this.mInputChangeListenerRecord = v7;`: This line assigns the newly created `InputChangeListenerRecord` instance to a field.

The similar APIs, `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` and `setHdmiRecordListener`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These methods also create instances of listener records and assign them to fields, similar to the `setInputChangeListener` method.

Given the similarities in code and functionality between these methods, it is reasonable to conclude that the `setInputChangeListener` method should have a similar access control level. The presence of `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` suggests that the method is enforcing some kind of permission check, which is consistent with the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and similar APIs, I assign the following access control level to the `setInputChangeListener` method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
