Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `addHotplugEventListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `addHotplugEventListener` method has three paths with similar code snippets, all of which involve:

1. Enforcing access permission using `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()`.
2. Setting the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.
3. Creating a new `HdmiControlService$HotplugEventListenerRecord` instance and linking it to death using `IBinder.linkToDeath()`.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `addLockoutResetCallback`: This method has a similarity score of 0.855305552482605 and an access control level of `NORMAL`. It also involves linking an `IBinder` to death using `linkToDeath()`.
2. `addDeviceEventListener`: This method has a similarity score of 0.8495174050331116 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It creates a new `HdmiControlService$DeviceEventListenerRecord` instance, links it to death using `IBinder.linkToDeath()`, and adds it to a list.

Considering the similarities between these methods, we can observe that:

* All three methods involve linking an `IBinder` to death using `linkToDeath()`.
* The `addHotplugEventListener` method creates a new `HdmiControlService$HotplugEventListenerRecord` instance, similar to `addDeviceEventListener`, which creates a new `HdmiControlService$DeviceEventListenerRecord` instance.
* The access control levels of the similar APIs are `NORMAL` and `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the `addHotplugEventListener` method should have an access control level of `NORMAL`. This is because it involves linking an `IBinder` to death, which is a relatively benign operation, and does not require the elevated privileges associated with `SYS_OR_SIG` or `DANGEROUS` access control levels.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity between the `addHotplugEventListener` method and the provided similar APIs, as well as the relatively low-risk nature of the operations involved.
