To determine the access control level for the `getUserCecSettings` method, we should consider the following factors:

1. **Similarity with other APIs**: The method has similarities with `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` and `setCecSettingStringValue`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `getUserCecSettings` method may also require a similar level of access control, as it interacts with the same `HdmiCecConfig` object.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The code snippet for `getUserCecSettings` shows that it calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` and `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`, which are indicative of access control enforcement. This implies that the method is intended to be protected against unauthorized access.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code for `getUserCecSettings` involves retrieving user settings from the `HdmiCecConfig` object, which may contain sensitive information. This further supports the need for a higher level of access control.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the `getUserCecSettings` method should have an access control level similar to its similar APIs, which is `SYS_OR_SIG`. This level ensures that only system or signature-protected applications can access the user's CEC settings, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the system.
