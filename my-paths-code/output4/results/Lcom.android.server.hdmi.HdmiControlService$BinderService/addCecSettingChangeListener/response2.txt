To assign an access control level to the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs.

The `addCecSettingChangeListener` method has two paths:

1. In the first path, a new `RemoteCallbackList` is created and added to the `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords` map. Then, the `registerChangeListener` method of `mHdmiCecConfig` is called with the provided listener.
2. In the second path, an existing `RemoteCallbackList` is retrieved from the `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords` map and the provided listener is registered.

The sink code shows that a new `RemoteCallbackList` is created and added to the map, and then the listener is registered.

Now, let's compare this method with similar APIs:

* The `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method removes a listener from the `mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords` map.
* The similarity score between `addCecSettingChangeListener` and `removeCecSettingChangeListener` is high (0.9317538738250732 and 0.9300751686096191).

Given that the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's likely that the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method also requires a similar level of access control. This is because both methods interact with the same map (`mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords`) and perform operations that could potentially affect the system's behavior.

Therefore, based on the code analysis and comparison with similar APIs, I assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `addCecSettingChangeListener` method.

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
