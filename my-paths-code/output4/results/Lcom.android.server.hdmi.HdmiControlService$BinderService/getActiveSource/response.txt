After analyzing the provided code paths for the `getActiveSource` API, I identified potential sinks based on the given positive and negative rules. Here's the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "HdmiCecLocalDevice v7 = this.mHdmiCecNetwork.getLocalDevice(4);",
      "HdmiCecLocalDevicePlayback v6 = v7;",
      "boolean v10 = v8.isActiveSource();",
      "int v18 = v16.getActivePath();",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v26 = new HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder(2,0);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v28 = v26.setPhysicalAddress(v18);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v29 = v28.setPortId(v24);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v30 = v29.setVendorId(0);",
      "StringBuilder v31 = new StringBuilder();",
      "StringBuilder v33 = v31.append(\"HDMI\");",
      "StringBuilder v34 = v33.append(v24);",
      "String v35 = v34.toString();",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v36 = v30.setDisplayName(v35);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo v37 = v36.build();"
    ],
    [
      "int v18 = this.mHdmiCecNetwork.physicalAddressToPortId(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v20 = new HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder(2,0);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v22 = v20.setPhysicalAddress(HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource.physicalAddress);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v23 = v22.setPortId(v17);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v24 = v23.setVendorId(0);",
      "StringBuilder v25 = new StringBuilder();",
      "StringBuilder v27 = v25.append(\"HDMI\");",
      "StringBuilder v28 = v27.append(v17);",
      "String v29 = v28.toString();",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo$Builder v30 = v24.setDisplayName(v29);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo v31 = v30.build();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

In the above JSON, I have identified two potential sinks in the provided code paths for the `getActiveSource` API. Both of these sinks are related to the creation and return of a new `HdmiDeviceInfo` object.

The first sink set is more sensitive because it involves multiple method calls (`getLocalDevice`, `isActiveSource`, `getActivePath`, etc.) that process different parameters, which could potentially lead to a more complex attack surface. The second sink set is slightly less sensitive as it only involves the creation of a new `HdmiDeviceInfo` object using the physical address and port ID from `HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource`.

Both sink sets follow at least one positive rule: they create a new object with data flow from API parameters (in this case, the physical address and port ID). They are also returned by the API, which makes them potential sinks. 

Note that I have excluded certain instructions like `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` as they seem to be related to access control or logging, which are considered negative rules according to your requirements.
