To determine the access control level for the `getActiveSource` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getActiveSource` method involves interacting with HDMI devices, specifically getting the active source device information. It uses `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` and `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`, indicating that it enforces access permissions and sets the work source UID to the calling UID. This suggests a level of access control but does not directly imply the need for system or signature-level permissions solely based on these calls, as they are also used in APIs with various access levels.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `canChangeSystemAudioMode()Z` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method checks if the system audio mode can be changed, which is a system-level operation.
   - `shouldHandleTvPowerKey()Z` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It determines whether the TV power key should be handled, involving system settings and potentially requiring system or signature-level permissions to modify or access such settings.

3. **Comparison**: Both similar APIs involve system-level decisions or operations that typically require higher levels of permission (`SYS_OR_SIG`). However, `getActiveSource` seems to focus on retrieving information about the active HDMI source rather than performing a system-level operation that modifies state or requires sensitive permissions.

Given this analysis, while `getActiveSource` involves access control and interacts with system services, its primary function is informational (retrieving device information) rather than modificational or directly impactful on system security or privacy. Therefore, it might not necessitate the highest level of access control (`SYS_OR_SIG`) as the similar APIs do, which are more directly involved in system-level operations.

Considering the enforcement of access permissions and the nature of the operation (retrieving device information), `getActiveSource` could potentially be classified under a less restrictive but still controlled access level. However, without explicit guidance on how `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` maps to the provided access control levels and considering the similar APIs' system-level implications, we must carefully consider the potential impact of this method.

Given the options:
- `NONE`: Implies no access control, which seems inappropriate given the use of `enforceAccessPermission`.
- `NORMAL`: Suggests a standard level of access control that might be appropriate for operations not directly impacting system security or privacy but still requiring some form of permission.
- `DANGEROUS`: Typically reserved for operations that can significantly impact the user's data or device functionality, which doesn't seem to directly apply here based on the provided information.
- `SYS_OR_SIG`: Implies a need for system or signature-level permissions, typically for operations that require high privileges.

**Decision**: Given that `getActiveSource` involves access control and is similar to APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access levels but focuses on retrieving device information (a less sensitive operation), it's challenging to definitively categorize without more specific guidance on the permission enforcement mechanism. However, considering the informational nature of the method and assuming `enforceAccessPermission` does not necessarily imply a need for system-level permissions in this context, one might lean towards `NORMAL` as a reasonable access control level, acknowledging that this choice is based on the method's apparent functionality and the comparisons made.

**Final Access Control Level**:

{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
Please note, the actual access control level could vary based on more detailed analysis of the Android system, the specific requirements of HDMI-related operations, and how permissions are enforced within the `HdmiControlService`. This determination is made based on the provided information and comparisons.
