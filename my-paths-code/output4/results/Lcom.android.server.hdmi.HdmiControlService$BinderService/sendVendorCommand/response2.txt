To determine the access control level for the `sendVendorCommand` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `sendVendorCommand` API has the following key elements:
1. It calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();`, which suggests that it enforces a specific permission.
2. It sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`.
3. It creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$15` and runs it on the service thread.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:
- `clearTimerRecording(II[B)V` has a similarity score of 0.9937217831611633 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet shows a similar pattern of creating a binder service instance (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$20`) and running it on the service thread.
- `setSystemAudioVolume(III)V` has a similarity score of 0.9933525323867798 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet also follows a similar pattern, creating a binder service instance (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$12`) and running it on the service thread.

Given these similarities, especially in how they interact with the service thread and enforce permissions, it suggests that `sendVendorCommand` likely requires a similar level of access control. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level is typically associated with system or signature-level permissions, which are more restrictive and require either system-level access or a specific signature (usually reserved for system apps or apps signed with the platform key).

Therefore, based on the similarities in code structure, permission enforcement, and interaction with system services, it's reasonable to conclude that `sendVendorCommand` should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
