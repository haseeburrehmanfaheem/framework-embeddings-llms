To determine the access control level for the `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method enforces access permission via `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();`, which indicates that it requires some form of access control to be invoked.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code involves adding a listener record (`HdmiControlService$HdmiControlStatusChangeListenerRecord`) to a list and posting a runnable (`WorkSourceUidPreservingRunnable`) to a handler, which suggests internal state management related to HDMI control status changes.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `setInputChangeListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission.
   - `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting similar security requirements.

Given these points, the method `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` seems to handle sensitive operations related to HDMI control status changes. It enforces access permissions and is involved in managing internal state that could potentially impact system functionality or user data privacy.

Considering the similarities with other APIs (`setInputChangeListener` and `addHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener`) that have been assigned a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` should also be assigned a similar access control level due to its involvement in system-level functionality and potential impact on device security or user privacy.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet, sink code, and similarities with other APIs, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the method's need for system or signature-level permissions to protect sensitive operations related to HDMI control status changes.
