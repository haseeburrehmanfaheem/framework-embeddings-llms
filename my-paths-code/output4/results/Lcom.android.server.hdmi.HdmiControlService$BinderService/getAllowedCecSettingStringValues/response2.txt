Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method.

1. **Similarity with other APIs**: The method has a high similarity score with `getUserCecSettings()` and `setCecSettingStringValue()`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` might also require a similar level of access control.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code for `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` includes lines that interact with `HdmiCecConfig` and `mSettings`, which are also present in the similar APIs. This indicates that the method is working with sensitive settings related to HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control).

3. **Permission Enforcement**: The method calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()`, which implies that it is enforcing some level of permission or access control.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the `getAllowedCecSettingStringValues` method likely requires a moderate to high level of access control, similar to the `SYS_OR_SIG` level of its similar APIs.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is based on the similarity with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, the analysis of the sink code, and the enforcement of permissions within the method.
