To determine the access control level for the `setArcMode` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `setArcMode` method has the following key elements:
- It calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();`, which suggests that it enforces a specific permission check.
- It then sets the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`.
- Finally, it creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14` and runs it on the service thread.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:
- `setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource()` has a high similarity score (0.9857192039489746) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code snippet involves creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$24` and running it on the service thread, similar to `setArcMode`.
- `powerOffRemoteDevice(II)` also has a high similarity score (0.98524010181427) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$9` and running it on the service thread, again similar to `setArcMode`.

Given these similarities, especially in how they interact with the service thread and the enforcement of access permissions, it suggests that `setArcMode` is likely to require a similar level of access control. The `SYS_OR_SIG` level indicates that the API can be accessed by either system components or applications signed with the same certificate as the system, reflecting a need for elevated privileges due to the nature of the operations (e.g., controlling HDMI settings).

Therefore, considering the similarities in code structure and the access control levels assigned to the comparable APIs, the `setArcMode` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
