To assign an access control level to the `sendStandby` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs. 

The `sendStandby` method has a similarity score of over 0.98 with two other APIs: `setSystemAudioMode` and `powerOnRemoteDevice`. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

Looking at the code snippet for `sendStandby`, it creates a new instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$16` and runs it on the service thread using `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v5)`. This pattern is similar to the code in the two comparable APIs, which also create instances of inner classes (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$8` and `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10`) and run them on the service thread.

Moreover, the `sendStandby` method calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()`, indicating that it requires certain permissions to be executed. This enforcement of access permission is a critical aspect in determining the access control level.

Given these similarities in code structure, the use of inner classes to handle operations on the service thread, and the explicit call to enforce access permissions, we can conclude that `sendStandby` shares the same access control requirements as its similar APIs.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the final access control level for the `sendStandby` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision is grounded in the similarity of code patterns and access control mechanisms with other established APIs that have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
