To determine the access control level for the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method, we need to analyze its code paths, sink code, and compare it with similar APIs.

1. **Code Paths Analysis**: The provided code paths show that this method is involved in removing a listener (`IHdmiCecSettingChangeListener`) from a record of listeners (`mHdmiCecSettingChangeListenerRecords`). This involves checking if the listener exists, unregistering it, and then potentially removing it from the records. 

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippets indicate operations related to listener management, such as getting a listener, unregistering it, and checking the registered callback count.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**: The similar APIs provided are `addCecSettingChangeListener` with high similarity scores. These APIs are used for adding listeners, which is essentially the opposite operation of removing listeners. Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require either system or signature-level permission to execute.

Given this analysis:

- The `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method is involved in managing (specifically, removing) listeners related to HDMI CEC setting changes. This operation could potentially impact system behavior or security if not properly restricted.
- Similar APIs (`addCecSettingChangeListener`) that manage adding these listeners require `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, suggesting that listener management for HDMI CEC settings is considered sensitive and requires elevated permissions.

**Conclusion**: Based on the method's functionality, its similarity to other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, and considering the potential impact of listener management on system security or behavior, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeCecSettingChangeListener` method should also have a similar access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
