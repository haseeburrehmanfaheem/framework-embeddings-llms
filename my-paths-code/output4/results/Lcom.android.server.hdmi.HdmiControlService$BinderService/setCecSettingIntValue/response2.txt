To determine the access control level for the `setCecSettingIntValue` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `setCecSettingStringValue`: This API has a similarity score of 0.883869469165802 with `setCecSettingIntValue` and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code for this API involves storing a global setting using `this.mStorageAdapter.storeGlobalSetting(v41, p2)`.
   - `getCecSettingStringValue`: With a similarity score of 0.8788451552391052, this API is also assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code includes retrieving a global setting via `this.mStorageAdapter.retrieveGlobalSetting(v30, v27)`.

2. **Code Analysis for `setCecSettingIntValue`:**
   - The method first checks and enforces access permission using `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()`.
   - It then proceeds to update a CEC setting based on the provided string parameter `p1` and integer value `p2`.
   - The code paths (path 1 and path 2) primarily differ in how they store the updated setting: either as a shared preference or as a global setting, using `this.mStorageAdapter.storeSharedPref(v43, v40)` or `this.mStorageAdapter.storeGlobalSetting(v43, v40)`, respectively.
   - Both paths involve logging and notifying that a setting has changed.

3. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   - The sink code snippets are involved with retrieving the setting type for `p1` and checking if the value type is "int". They also include storing the integer value as a global setting.

Given these points, we observe that:
- Both similar APIs (`setCecSettingStringValue` and `getCecSettingStringValue`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.
- The `setCecSettingIntValue` API also deals with system settings (storing global settings or shared preferences), which typically requires higher-level permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.

Based on the similarities in functionality and the need for secure access control when modifying system settings, it is reasonable to conclude that the `setCecSettingIntValue` API should have a similar access control level to its counterparts.

Therefore, considering the provided information and analysis:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This conclusion aligns with the requirement for secure and controlled access when dealing with system settings modifications.
