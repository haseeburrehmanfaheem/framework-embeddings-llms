To determine the access control level for the `removeHotplugEventListener` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method `removeHotplugEventListener` involves iterating over a list of event listener records (`mHotplugEventListenerRecords`) and removing a specific listener based on the input parameter `p1`. It also calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` which suggests that there is some form of permission check being enforced. Additionally, it uses `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`, indicating a handling of UID (User ID) for work source purposes.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **API Name: `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes([I)V`**: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The high similarity score suggests that the functionality and possibly the security considerations are similar to `removeHotplugEventListener`.
   - **API Name: `setVrThread(I)V`**: With an access control level of `NONE`, this API seems less relevant in terms of security implications compared to the method we're analyzing.

3. **Security Implications**:
   - The presence of `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` implies that there are specific permissions required to call this method, suggesting it's not entirely open (`NONE`) and might require some level of access control.
   - The handling of event listeners and the enforcement of access permissions point towards a need for protection against unauthorized access or misuse.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the analysis above, especially considering the similarity with `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes([I)V` and the presence of permission checks within the method itself, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects the need for system or signature-level permissions to ensure security and proper functionality.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This choice leans towards ensuring that only system or signed applications can remove hotplug event listeners, aligning with the observed behavior in similar APIs and the method's internal permission checks.
