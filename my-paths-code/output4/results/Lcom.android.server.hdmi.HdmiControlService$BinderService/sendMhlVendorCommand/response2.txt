To determine the access control level for the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `setSystemAudioVolume(III)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - `sendVendorCommand(II[BZ)V` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The `sendMhlVendorCommand` method enforces access permission via `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();`, which suggests that it requires a certain level of access control.
   - It sets the work source UID to the calling UID, which is a common practice in Android services to track which app is using the service.
   - The method creates an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$21` and runs it on the service thread. This pattern is similar to the other provided APIs (`setSystemAudioVolume` and `sendVendorCommand`), which also run specific tasks on the service thread.

3. **Similarity in Behavior:**
   - The behavior of `sendMhlVendorCommand` (in terms of enforcing access permissions, setting work source UID, and running a task on the service thread) is similar to that of `setSystemAudioVolume` and `sendVendorCommand`. Both of these methods have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require either system or signature-level permission to be called.

Given the similarities in behavior, code structure, and the fact that both similar APIs (`setSystemAudioVolume` and `sendVendorCommand`) are assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that `sendMhlVendorCommand` should also have a similar access control requirement. This is because all these methods seem to be interacting with system-level services or performing actions that require elevated permissions, consistent with the `SYS_OR_SIG` designation.

**Access Control Level Decision:**

Based on the analysis and comparison with similar APIs, the `sendMhlVendorCommand` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This reflects its need for system or signature-level permission to execute, given its interaction with system services and enforcement of access permissions.
