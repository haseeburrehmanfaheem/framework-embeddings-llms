To determine the access control level for the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method, we need to consider its similarity with other provided APIs and their assigned access control levels. 

The given API is similar to `powerOnRemoteDevice(II)V` and `powerOffRemoteDevice(II)V`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that these methods are restricted to either system processes or applications signed with the same certificate as the system, indicating a high level of security requirement due to their potential impact on device functionality.

Looking at the code snippet provided for `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource`, we see that it performs two significant operations before executing its main task:
1. `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();` - This line enforces access permission, indicating that only authorized entities can call this method.
2. `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();` - This sets the work source UID to the calling UID, which might be related to tracking or managing the resource usage or permissions of the calling application.

The main operation involves creating an instance of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$11` and running it on the service thread. The similarity in structure and purpose with `powerOnRemoteDevice` and `powerOffRemoteDevice`, which both deal with controlling remote devices over HDMI, suggests that `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` also requires a similar level of access control.

Given these points:
- The method's similarity to other methods with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control.
- The enforcement of access permissions within the method.
- The potential impact on device functionality by controlling remote devices.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the `askRemoteDeviceToBecomeActiveSource` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
