After reviewing the provided code snippets and similar APIs, I can see that the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method is interacting with the `mSystemAudioModeChangeListenerRecords` iterator and removing a listener record from it. This operation seems to be related to managing system audio mode change listeners.

The similar API `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that removing a listener record is a sensitive operation that requires either system or signature-level permission. The code snippet for this API also shows similar operations, such as iterating over a records iterator and removing a listener record.

The other similar API `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which further supports the idea that managing system audio mode change listeners requires elevated permissions.

Considering these points, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` method.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
