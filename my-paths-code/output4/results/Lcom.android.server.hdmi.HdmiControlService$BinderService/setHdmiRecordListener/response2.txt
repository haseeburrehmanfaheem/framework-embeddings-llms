Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `setHdmiRecordListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `setHdmiRecordListener` method has three paths with similar code snippets, all of which involve:

1. Enforcing access permission using `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()`.
2. Setting the work source UID to the calling UID using `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`.
3. Creating a new `HdmiControlService$HdmiRecordListenerRecord` instance and assigning it to `this.mRecordListenerRecord`.
4. Linking the binder to death using `v9.linkToDeath(this.mRecordListenerRecord, 0)`.

The similar APIs, `addDeviceEventListener` and `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, have access control levels of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also involve creating a new record instance and linking the binder to death, similar to the `setHdmiRecordListener` method.

Given the similarities in code structure and functionality, it is likely that the `setHdmiRecordListener` method requires a similar level of access control. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level suggests that the method can be accessed by system or signature-protected components, which aligns with the enforcement of access permission using `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I assign the following access control level to the `setHdmiRecordListener` method:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
