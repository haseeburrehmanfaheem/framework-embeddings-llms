Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `queryDisplayStatus` method.

The `queryDisplayStatus` method has a similar structure to the provided APIs (`setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource` and `toggleAndFollowTvPower`) with a high similarity score of 1.0000001192092896, which indicates that they share almost identical code patterns. 

All these methods call `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` and `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`, which suggests that they require a similar level of access control.

Given the similarities in their code structure and the fact that both `setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource` and `toggleAndFollowTvPower` have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to conclude that `queryDisplayStatus` should also have the same access control level.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `queryDisplayStatus` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
