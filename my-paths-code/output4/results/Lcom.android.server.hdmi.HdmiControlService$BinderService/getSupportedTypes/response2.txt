To assign an access control level to the `getSupportedTypes` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getSupportedTypes` method has the following key aspects:

1. It calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()`, which suggests that it requires some form of permission or access control.
2. It accesses a list of local devices using `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$fgetmLocalDevices(this.this$0)`.
3. It returns an array of integers, which seems to represent the supported types.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

* `getDeviceList()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and also accesses a list of devices using `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$fgetmHdmiCecNetwork(this.this$0)`. The similarity score is 0.7485915422439575, indicating a relatively high similarity.
* `getActiveSource()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and accesses a local device using `this.mHdmiCecNetwork.getLocalDevice(4)`. Although the similarity score is slightly lower (0.7279078960418701), it still shares similarities with `getSupportedTypes`.

Given these observations, we can infer that:

* The `getSupportedTypes` method requires some form of access control, likely due to its interaction with local devices.
* The similar APIs (`getDeviceList()` and `getActiveSource()`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions.

Based on these factors, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getSupportedTypes` method, as it likely requires similar permissions to access and interact with local devices.

The final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
