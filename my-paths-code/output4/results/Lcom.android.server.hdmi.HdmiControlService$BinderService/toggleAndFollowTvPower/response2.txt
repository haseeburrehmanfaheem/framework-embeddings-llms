Based on the provided information, we can see that the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method has a similar structure to the two provided APIs: `setSystemAudioModeOnForAudioOnlySource()` and `queryDisplayStatus()`. All three methods call `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` and `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()`, which suggests that they require a similar level of access control.

The two similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which indicates that they can only be called by system or signature applications. Given the similarity in code structure and the fact that `toggleAndFollowTvPower` also calls the same permission-enforcing methods, it is reasonable to assign the same access control level to this method.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the similarity with other APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `toggleAndFollowTvPower` method.

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
