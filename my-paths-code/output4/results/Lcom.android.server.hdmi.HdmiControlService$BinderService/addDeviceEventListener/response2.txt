To determine the access control level for the `addDeviceEventListener` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `addDeviceEventListener` method has three paths, but they all involve the following key steps:

1. `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();`: This line suggests that the method enforces some kind of permission check.
2. `HdmiControlService$DeviceEventListenerRecord v7 = new HdmiControlService$DeviceEventListenerRecord(HdmiControlService,p2);`: This line creates a new record for the device event listener.
3. `IBinder v9 = p2.asBinder();` and `v9.linkToDeath(v7, 0);`: These lines link the binder to the death of the listener record.
4. `boolean v11 = this.mDeviceEventListenerRecords.add(v7);`: This line adds the listener record to a list.

The similar APIs provided are:

* `setHdmiRecordListener(Landroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiRecordListener;)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
* `addHotplugEventListener(Landroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiHotplugEventListener;)V` with an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require either system or signature-level permission to access.

Comparing the code of `addDeviceEventListener` with the similar APIs, we can see that it involves similar operations, such as creating a record, linking to death, and adding to a list. Additionally, the method enforces an access permission check using `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();`.

Based on this analysis, it is likely that the `addDeviceEventListener` method requires a similar level of access control as the similar APIs.

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
