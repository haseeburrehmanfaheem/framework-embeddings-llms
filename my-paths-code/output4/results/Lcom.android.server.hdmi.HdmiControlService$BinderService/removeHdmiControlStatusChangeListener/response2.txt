To assign an access control level to the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener`: This API has a similarity score of 0.8855867385864258 with the target method and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippet shows interaction with listener records, similar to the target method.
   - `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener`: With a similarity score of 0.7922337651252747, this method also interacts with listener records and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

2. **Code Snippets of the Target Method:**
   - Both paths (1 and 2) of the target method start with `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();` and `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, indicating some level of access control enforcement.
   - The sink code involves iterating over listener records, accessing a specific listener, and removing it, which suggests modification of system-level listeners.

3. **Semantics and Access Control:**
   - Given that the method modifies system-level listener records (similar to the `removeSystemAudioModeChangeListener` and `addHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` methods), it's reasonable to infer that this operation requires a certain level of system or signature access permission.
   - The presence of `enforceAccessPermission()` suggests that the method is intended to be protected against unauthorized access, further supporting the assignment of a stricter access control level.

Based on these considerations and the similarities with other APIs assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's logical to conclude that the `removeHdmiControlStatusChangeListener` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because modifying HDMI control status change listeners likely requires system or signature-level permissions to ensure that only authorized components can make such changes.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API in JSON format is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
