To determine the access control level for the `removeHdmiCecVolumeControlFeatureListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission();`, which suggests that it is enforcing some form of permission check.
   - It then sets the work source UID to the calling UID with `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`, indicating a concern for identifying or managing the caller's identity or permissions.
   - The method ultimately removes a listener (`this.this$0.removeHdmiControlVolumeControlStatusChangeListener(p1);`), which is related to volume control status changes.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code `this.this$0.removeHdmiControlVolumeControlStatusChangeListener(p1);` indicates that the method interacts with internal listeners, specifically those related to HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) volume control features.

3. **Similar API Analysis**:
   - The similar API `setInputChangeListener(Landroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiInputChangeListener;)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that APIs interacting with sensitive hardware or system-level functionalities (like input change listeners for HDMI) may require significant permission levels.
   - The similarity score indicates a moderate to high degree of similarity in functionality or context, implying that both methods deal with setting or removing listeners related to HDMI control features.

Given these points:

- **Permission Enforcement**: The method enforces access permissions and manages the caller's UID, indicating a need for some level of access control.
- **Functionality**: It deals with removing a listener for volume control status changes, which is related to system-level functionalities (HDMI CEC) but may not directly pose a significant security risk if improperly accessed (compared to setting input change listeners).
- **Similarity with Other APIs**: The similar API has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggesting that system or signature-level permissions might be required for such operations. However, the specific method in question seems more related to removing a listener rather than setting one up, which could imply a slightly different risk profile.

**Conclusion**:

Considering the method's functionality, its interaction with internal listeners, and the similarity with other APIs that require system or signature-level permissions, but also taking into account the nature of the operation (removing a listener), it seems reasonable to assign an access control level that reflects the need for permission management without necessarily requiring the highest level of system or signature permissions.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This choice balances the need for managed access with the specific functionality of the method, which seems less risky than setting up listeners but still requires some form of permission check.
