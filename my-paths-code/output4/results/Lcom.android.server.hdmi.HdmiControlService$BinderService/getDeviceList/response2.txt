To determine the access control level for the `getDeviceList` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `getDeviceList` method first calls `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()`, which suggests that it is enforcing some form of permission check. Then, it sets the work source UID to the calling UID, which can be related to how the system manages and attributes operations to different applications or processes. Afterward, it retrieves a list of safe CEc devices locked from an `HdmiCecNetwork` object.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - The `canChangeSystemAudioMode()` method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method interacts with the HDMI CEc network to retrieve device information and makes a decision based on that, which implies it requires system or signature-level permission due to its potential impact on system settings.
   - The `getSupportedTypes()` method also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It fetches local devices from the `HdmiControlService`, indicating it needs system-level access to operate on the list of supported device types.

3. **Comparison and Decision**:
   - Both similar APIs (`canChangeSystemAudioMode()` and `getSupportedTypes()`) have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their interaction with system settings or services that require elevated permissions.
   - The `getDeviceList` method, while not directly altering system settings like `canChangeSystemAudioMode()`, does interact with the `HdmiCecNetwork` and fetches a list of devices. This operation seems less intrusive than changing audio modes but still requires access to system services (as indicated by `enforceAccessPermission()`).
   - However, considering it's primarily fetching information rather than making changes, and given that both similar APIs have `SYS_OR_SIG` access due to their nature of either altering settings or requiring system-level permissions for device type retrieval, we must consider the context of `getDeviceList`. If this method is crucial for the functioning of a system service or requires signature-level permission due to its potential impact on how applications interact with HDMI devices, it would align more closely with `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given these considerations and the fact that both similar APIs have been classified as `SYS_OR_SIG`, but acknowledging that `getDeviceList` is primarily an informational retrieval method without direct system modification capabilities as seen in `canChangeSystemAudioMode()`, a balanced approach suggests it should still be considered sensitive due to its interaction with system services. However, the primary factor here is the permission enforcement and the type of data it accesses.

**Conclusion**: Considering the information provided and the nature of the method, which involves accessing device lists through system services but does not directly modify system settings like one of the compared methods, a cautious approach would still lean towards requiring system or signature-level access due to its dependency on `HdmiControlService` and the enforcement of access permissions.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
