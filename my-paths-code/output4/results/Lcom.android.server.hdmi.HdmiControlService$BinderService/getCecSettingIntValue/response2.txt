Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `getCecSettingIntValue` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getCecSettingIntValue` method has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve retrieving a CEC setting value from either shared preferences or global settings. The method uses `HdmiControlService.enforceAccessPermission()` to enforce access permission and `HdmiControlService.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid()` to set the work source UID to the calling UID.

The similar APIs, `getCecSettingStringValue`, have a similarity score of 0.8963440656661987 and 0.8813968896865845, respectively, and both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also involve retrieving CEC setting values from either global settings or shared preferences.

Given the similarities between the `getCecSettingIntValue` method and the `getCecSettingStringValue` APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getCecSettingIntValue` method should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, the final access control level for the `getCecSettingIntValue` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires either system or signature-level permission to access the CEC setting values.
