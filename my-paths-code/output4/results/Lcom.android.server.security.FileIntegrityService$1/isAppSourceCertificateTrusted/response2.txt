To determine the access control level for the `isAppSourceCertificateTrusted` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippets Analysis**:
   - The method checks if an app's source certificate is trusted. It involves generating a certificate from a byte array and checking if this certificate is in a collection of trusted certificates.
   - The method interacts with system properties (`SystemProperties.getInt("ro.apk_verity.mode", 0)`), which could imply a level of system interaction, but it does not directly modify system settings or perform actions that would typically require elevated permissions.
   - It uses `AppOpsManager` to check an operation (with opcode 66) without throwing an exception, indicating some form of permission or operation check.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code focuses on generating a certificate from a byte array and checking if it's in a collection of trusted certificates. This process is crucial for security but does not directly indicate dangerous operations like data modification or sensitive information leakage.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `requestUninstall([BLandroid/app/timezone/ICallback;)I` has an access control level of `NONE`. This API seems to involve uninstallation requests based on input parameters, which might not directly correlate with the security implications of certificate trust verification.
   - `initRecoveryServiceWithSigFile(Ljava/lang/String;[B[B)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permissions. This method involves verifying file signatures and interacting with recovery service certificates, which has significant security implications.

Given these considerations:

- The `isAppSourceCertificateTrusted` method primarily checks the trustworthiness of a certificate without performing dangerous operations like data modification or direct system changes.
- It does involve system interactions (checking ops, system properties) but in a read-only or check capacity.
- The similar APIs provide insights into how certificate and security-related operations are handled. While `initRecoveryServiceWithSigFile` suggests that some security verification processes require high-level permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG`), the nature of `isAppSourceCertificateTrusted` is more about verification rather than modification or sensitive data access.

Considering these factors, the `isAppSourceCertificateTrusted` method seems to be performing a necessary security check without directly accessing or modifying sensitive information that would require dangerous or system/signature level permissions. Therefore, its operations are more aligned with a **NORMAL** access control level, as it involves checks and verifications that do not pose an immediate risk or require elevated privileges beyond normal application operations.
