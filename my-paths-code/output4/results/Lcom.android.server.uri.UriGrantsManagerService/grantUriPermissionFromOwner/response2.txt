To determine the access control level for the `grantUriPermissionFromOwner` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two code paths, but both involve creating a `GrantUri` object and checking grant URI permissions using `UriGrantsManagerService.checkGrantUriPermissionUnlocked`. This suggests that the method is involved in managing URI permissions, which is a sensitive operation as it can affect data security and privacy.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code snippets provided also focus on the creation of `GrantUri` objects and the checking of URI permissions, reinforcing the notion that this method's primary functionality is related to URI permission management.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - The similar APIs provided, `takePersistableUriPermission`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to managing URI permissions are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level access.
   - The similarity in functionality (dealing with URI permissions) and the high similarity scores indicate that `grantUriPermissionFromOwner` likely requires a similar level of access control.

Given these points, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `grantUriPermissionFromOwner` seems appropriate. This is because the method deals with sensitive operations related to URI permission management, similar to the provided APIs with known access control levels.

**Access Control Level**: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege and recognizes the potential security implications of managing URI permissions, thus requiring a higher level of access control to protect against unauthorized or malicious activities.
