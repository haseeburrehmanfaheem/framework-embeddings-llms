To determine the access control level for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method returns a `ParceledListSlice` object containing an empty `ArrayList`. This operation doesn't seem to directly interact with sensitive data or operations that require elevated permissions.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet shows the creation of an `ArrayList`, its wrapping in a `ParceledListSlice`, and then returning this slice. Similar to the method's overall behavior, it does not indicate direct access or manipulation of sensitive resources.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Two similar APIs are provided, both named `getUriPermissions` with a high similarity score (0.9748629331588745 and 0.9687861204147339). 
   - Both of these similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to URI permissions are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.

Given the similarities between `getGrantedUriPermissions` and the provided `getUriPermissions` APIs, both in terms of functionality (dealing with URI permissions) and code structure (returning a `ParceledListSlice`), it is reasonable to infer that `getGrantedUriPermissions` should also be treated as requiring elevated access control. Since the similar APIs are classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they require system or signature-level permissions due to their interaction with sensitive data (URI permissions), it's logical to apply a similar access control level to `getGrantedUriPermissions`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of similar APIs and their access control levels, the final access control level for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` API should be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This determination aligns with the principle that operations involving permissions, especially those related to URI access which can potentially expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access, should be protected at a system or signature level to prevent misuse.
