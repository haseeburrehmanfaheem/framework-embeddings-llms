To determine the access control level for the `getUriPermissions` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with similar operations:
   - Both create an empty `ArrayList`, assign it to another variable, and then return a `ParceledListSlice` object based on this empty list.
   - There is no apparent interaction with sensitive data or operations that would require specific permissions.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code provided also involves creating an `ArrayList`, assigning it to another variable, creating a `ParceledListSlice` from this list, and returning it. This pattern matches the method's paths and does not indicate any direct access to sensitive information.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - Two similar APIs are mentioned with high similarity scores (> 0.96), both named `getGrantedUriPermissions`. 
   - These APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which typically means the API is either accessible only to system applications or requires a specific signature permission.
   - The code snippets for these similar APIs show a pattern very close to what's observed in the `getUriPermissions` method: creating an empty list and returning it as a `ParceledListSlice`.

Given this analysis, we can infer that:
- The operation of `getUriPermissions` is closely related to managing or retrieving URI permissions.
- Despite not directly accessing sensitive data within its provided paths, the similarity with other APIs that are restricted (`SYS_OR_SIG`) suggests there might be an underlying reason for similar access control due to the nature of the information it handles (URI permissions).

However, without explicit evidence of `getUriPermissions` dealing with sensitive operations or requiring system-level access directly in its provided code snippets, and considering the operation is about retrieving URI permissions which could imply potential exposure to how data is shared between applications, we should consider a conservative approach based on the information given.

Given that similar APIs (`getGrantedUriPermissions`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` but noting that our method does not explicitly demonstrate system-level or signature-protected operations within its shown code paths, and considering the principle of least privilege (assigning the least permissions necessary for functionality), one might argue towards a less restrictive yet still cautious approach. 

However, since both provided similar APIs are classified under `SYS_OR_SIG`, and without explicit evidence to the contrary in terms of handling sensitive data directly or requiring specific system-level access within its code paths, we must consider that `getUriPermissions` could potentially be subject to similar restrictions due to its purpose and similarity with other restricted APIs.

Therefore, based on the information provided and considering a conservative stance aligned with the principle of least privilege but also recognizing the pattern with similar APIs:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision reflects the potential need for this API to be protected in a manner consistent with system or signature-level access controls, given its similarity and functional context with other restricted APIs.
