To assign an access control level to the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method interacts with a `Handler` object, which is used to send and remove messages. Specifically, it:

1. Removes messages with code 6 using `removeMessages(6)`.
2. Sends an empty message with code 6 using `sendEmptyMessage(6)`.
3. Runs a lambda expression using `runWithScissors(v9, 0)`.

The similar APIs provided also interact with a `Handler` object:

1. `disableForUser` posts a lambda expression using `post(v25)`.
2. `setImeWindowStatus` posts a lambda expression using `post(v10)`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permission to execute.

Although the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method does not post a lambda expression using `post()`, it still interacts with the `Handler` object in a way that could potentially impact the system's behavior. The removal and sending of messages, as well as the execution of a lambda expression, may require system-level permission to prevent unauthorized access or modification.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `reportKeyguardShowingChanged` method, as it is similar in nature to the provided APIs and may require system-level permission to execute.
