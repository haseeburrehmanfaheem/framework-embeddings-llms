To determine the access control level for the `isDeviceLocked` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `isDeviceLocked` API has three paths, but they all share a common pattern:

1.  They call `ITrustManager$Stub.getCallingUid()` and `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` to handle user-related operations.
2.  They interact with `VirtualDeviceManagerInternal` and check if the display is owned by any virtual device using `isDisplayOwnedByAnyVirtualDevice()`.
3.  They use `LockPatternUtils` to check if separate profile challenge is enabled.

The provided similar APIs, `sendAppPrivateCommand` and `setMainSession`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also handle user-related operations using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser()` and interact with sessions or services (e.g., `TvInputManagerService$SessionState`).

Comparing these patterns, we can see that the `isDeviceLocked` API performs similar user-related and session/service interaction operations as the provided similar APIs.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the `isDeviceLocked` API requires a system or signature-level access control to ensure secure handling of device lock information. Therefore, the assigned access control level for the `isDeviceLocked` API would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarities between the `isDeviceLocked` API and the provided similar APIs, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
