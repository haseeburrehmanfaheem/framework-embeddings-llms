To determine the access control level for the `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method, we should analyze its interactions with sinks (e.g., clearing a `SparseBooleanArray`, sending messages via a `Handler`) and compare these with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Interactions with Sinks**: The `clearAllBiometricRecognized` method interacts with two main sinks:
   - It clears a `SparseBooleanArray` (`this.mUsersUnlockedByBiometric`), which suggests an operation that affects the state of biometric recognition for users.
   - It sends a message via a `Handler`, which is typically used for inter-thread communication or delaying operations. In this case, it seems to be related to notifying about changes in biometric recognition status.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The `unlockedByBiometricForUser` API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It modifies the `SparseBooleanArray` by putting a value into it, which is somewhat similar to clearing the array in `clearAllBiometricRecognized`, as both affect the state of biometric recognition.
   - The `registerTrustListener` API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves sending a message via a `Handler`, similar to `clearAllBiometricRecognized`.

Given these observations, we can infer that:
- Modifying or clearing biometric recognition states and sending handler messages in the context of user authentication or system services typically require system or signature-level permissions (`SYS_OR_SIG`) due to their potential impact on system security and user privacy.
- Both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, suggesting that operations related to biometric recognition and system messaging are sensitive.

Therefore, considering the method's functionality and its similarity to other APIs with `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, it is reasonable to assign a similar access control level to `clearAllBiometricRecognized`.

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
