To determine the access control level for the `isDeviceSecure` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has three paths with similar code structures, involving interactions with `LockPatternUtils`, `VirtualDeviceManagerInternal`, and `ActivityManager`. It checks if a device is secure based on various conditions, including separate profile challenge enablement and whether the display is owned by any virtual device.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink points involve accessing `LockPatternUtils` for checking separate profile challenge enablement and determining if the device is secure. These operations are related to security settings of the device.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **detectFace**: This API has a similarity score of 0.777 with `isDeviceSecure`. It involves face detection and uses `LockPatternUtils` for getting strong authentication for a user, indicating it deals with user security.
   - The access control level for `detectFace` is `SYS_OR_SIG`, suggesting that this operation requires either system or signature-level permissions due to its involvement in sensitive operations like face detection and strong authentication.

Given the information above:

- **Security Sensitivity**: Both the `isDeviceSecure` method and the similar API (`detectFace`) deal with security-related checks on the device. The `isDeviceSecure` method specifically involves checking if a device is secure, which includes verifying separate profile challenge settings and the security status of the device.
  
- **Permission Levels**: The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level for the `detectFace` API implies that operations affecting or querying sensitive security settings require elevated permissions. Given the similar nature of operations (both are related to device/user security), it's reasonable to infer that `isDeviceSecure` would also require a significant level of permission.

- **Decision**: Since `isDeviceSecure` involves checking and possibly exposing sensitive information about the device's security status, which could potentially be used by malicious actors to plan their attacks better, it requires a protection level that prevents unauthorized access. The fact that a similar API (`detectFace`) with security implications has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` supports assigning a similar or equally restrictive access control level to `isDeviceSecure`.

Therefore, considering the security implications and the similarity with another API that requires system or signature-level permissions, the most appropriate access control level for `isDeviceSecure` would be:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This ensures that only authorized components within the system can invoke this method, protecting sensitive security information about the device.
