Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `registerTrustListener` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `registerTrustListener` method has a similarity score of over 0.97 with two other APIs, `reportUnlockAttempt` and `reportUnlockLockout`, both of which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. The code snippets for these similar APIs show that they all interact with a `Handler` and send messages to it.

Given the high similarity scores and the similar code patterns, it is likely that the `registerTrustListener` method requires a similar access control level. Since both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it is reasonable to assign the same level to `registerTrustListener`.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `registerTrustListener` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
