To determine the access control level for the `setOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `setOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier` method allows setting whether OEM unlock is allowed by the carrier. This involves interacting with the `OemLock` service and modifying its state based on the input parameters (`p1` and `p2`). The method checks if the calling user is an admin before proceeding.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`setOemUnlockAllowedByUser(Z)V`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to setting OEM unlock permissions are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.
   - The code snippets provided for these similar APIs show interactions with the `OemLockService` and modifications to its state, which is consistent with the behavior of the method in question.

3. **Access Control Considerations**:
   - The method modifies a security-related setting (`OemUnlockAllowedByCarrier`), which implies that it could have significant implications for device security.
   - It checks if the user is an admin before making changes, indicating that not all users are intended to have access to this functionality.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the sensitive nature of OEM unlock settings and the similarities with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that the `setOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier` method should also be assigned a similar access control level. This ensures that only authorized (system or signature-level) entities can modify such critical security settings.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```
