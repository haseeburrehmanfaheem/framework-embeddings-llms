To assign an access control level to the `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs provided.

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - The method checks if the calling user is an admin.
   - It also checks for a specific user restriction ("no_factory_reset") on the system user.
   - The method interacts with `OemLock` service to set whether OEM unlock is allowed by device, based on the input parameter `p1`.
   - Additionally, it attempts to force OEM unlock enabled through `PersistentDataBlockManagerInternal`, though this part seems incomplete or incorrectly represented in the provided code snippets (reference to `p2` which is not defined in the method parameters).

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs**:
   - The similar API `isOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier()` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to checking OEM unlock status are considered sensitive and require either system or signature-level permissions.
   - Another similar API, `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser()`, also has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. This reinforces the notion that any interaction with OEM unlock settings or statuses is treated with a higher level of security.

3. **Access Control Level Determination**:
   - Given the sensitive nature of OEM unlocking and the method's ability to alter this setting, it's reasonable to infer that `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser` should have a restrictive access control level.
   - The method's interaction with system-level services (like `UserManager`, `OemLockService`, and `PersistentDataBlockManagerInternal`) further supports the need for elevated permissions.

Based on these considerations, it seems appropriate to assign an access control level that reflects the sensitivity of the operation being performed. Since both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level due to their interaction with sensitive settings, and considering the nature of the `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method, which directly modifies such a setting, it's logical to conclude that this method should also require system or signature-level permissions.

Therefore, the final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
