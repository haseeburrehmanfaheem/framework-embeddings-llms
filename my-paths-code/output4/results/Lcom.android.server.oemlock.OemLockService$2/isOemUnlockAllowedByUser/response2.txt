To determine the access control level for the `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method, we should consider the similarity in code and functionality with the provided similar APIs, as well as the nature of the operation it performs.

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**:
   - The `isOemUnlockAllowedByCarrier()` method has a high similarity score (0.9429548978805542) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations related to OEM unlock settings, especially those that involve carrier or user allowances, are considered sensitive.
   - The `setOemUnlockAllowedByUser(Z)V` method also has a high similarity score (0.9338394999504089) and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further indicates that any modifications or queries related to OEM unlock permissions are treated with a higher level of security.

2. **Nature of the Operation**:
   - The `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method checks if the OEM unlock is allowed by the user. This operation involves querying a setting that could potentially allow a user to modify the device's bootloader, which has significant security implications.
   - Given that setting or querying such permissions can impact the security and integrity of the device, these operations are typically restricted to system or signature applications, hence the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

3. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The provided code snippet for `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` shows a clear call to `v5.isOemUnlockAllowedByDevice()`, which is similar in nature to the operations performed by the similar APIs mentioned.
   - The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v4)` suggests that the method is careful about managing the calling identity, which is a good practice but does not directly influence the access control level decision.

**Conclusion**:
Given the high similarity with other APIs that have been assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels and considering the sensitive nature of querying OEM unlock permissions, it's reasonable to conclude that the `isOemUnlockAllowedByUser` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
