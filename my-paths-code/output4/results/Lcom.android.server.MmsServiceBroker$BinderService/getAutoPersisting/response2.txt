To determine the access control level for the `getAutoPersisting` method, we need to analyze its behavior, the sink it interacts with, and compare it with similar APIs, particularly focusing on the provided `setAutoPersisting` API.

1. **Analysis of `getAutoPersisting` Method:**
   - The method `getAutoPersisting` appears to be retrieving a setting or state related to auto-persisting from an MMS service.
   - It does so by connecting to the MmsServiceBroker and then invoking the `getAutoPersisting` method on the obtained service instance.
   - The method returns a boolean value indicating whether auto-persisting is enabled.

2. **Comparison with Similar API (`setAutoPersisting`):**
   - The similar API, `setAutoPersisting`, has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
   - This API sets the auto-persisting setting to a specified value, which implies it can modify system or significant settings.
   - Given that `getAutoPersisting` is related but only retrieves the current state without modifying it, its impact on system security or user data privacy might be less severe compared to setting such a state.

3. **Access Control Level Determination:**
   - Considering that `getAutoPersisting` method is used to retrieve information and does not modify any settings (unlike `setAutoPersisting`), it's likely less risky.
   - However, since it interacts with system services (MmsServiceBroker) and retrieves a setting that could potentially be security or privacy relevant, it may still require some level of access control.
   - Given the provided choices (`NONE`, `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, `SYS_OR_SIG`), and considering the method's nature:
     - **`NONE`** seems too permissive since the method does interact with system services.
     - **`DANGEROUS`** might be too restrictive as the method doesn't change any state, it only retrieves information.
     - **`SYS_OR_SIG`** could be considered if the retrieved setting is highly sensitive or critical to system operation or user privacy, but given it's a retrieval and not a modification, this might also be too high unless the information itself is deemed very sensitive.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable approach would be to assign an access control level that reflects its need for some protection due to its interaction with system services but acknowledges its read-only nature. Thus, **`NORMAL`** seems like an appropriate choice as it suggests a moderate level of access control, recognizing the method's potential impact without overly restricting or exposing sensitive information.
