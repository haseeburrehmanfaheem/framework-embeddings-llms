To determine the access control level for the `importTextMessage` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `importTextMessage` method interacts with an `IMms` service (MmsServiceBroker) to perform its operation. This interaction involves importing a text message into the system, which could potentially have security implications regarding data privacy and integrity.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `addTextMessageDraft`: This API has a high similarity score with `importTextMessage`. It is used for adding drafts of text messages and has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that it requires system or signature-level permissions to execute.
   - `addMultimediaMessageDraft`: Similar to `addTextMessageDraft`, this API deals with adding drafts but for multimedia messages. It also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Given the similarities in functionality and the fact that all these methods interact with sensitive data (text or multimedia messages), it's reasonable to infer that they require similar levels of access control to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to user data.

Considering the above points, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `importTextMessage` seems appropriate. This is because importing text messages likely involves handling sensitive user information and thus should be restricted to system-level or applications signed with the platform key (signature-level permissions) to ensure security and privacy.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision aligns with the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only entities with a high level of trust (system or signature-level) can perform operations that could potentially impact user data security and privacy.
