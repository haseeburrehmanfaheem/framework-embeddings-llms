To assign an access control level to the `addTextMessageDraft` method, we need to consider the similarity scores and access control levels of the provided similar APIs, as well as the semantics of the `addTextMessageDraft` method itself.

The two similar APIs are:
1. `addMultimediaMessageDraft`: This API has a high similarity score (0.9367508888244629) with `addTextMessageDraft`, indicating that their functionalities or implementations share significant similarities. Its access control level is `SYS_OR_SIG`.
2. `importTextMessage`: Although its similarity score (0.8296193480491638) is somewhat lower than that of `addMultimediaMessageDraft`, it still suggests a notable level of similarity in functionality or implementation with `addTextMessageDraft`. Its access control level is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which implies that they require system-level or signature-level permissions to execute, possibly due to their interaction with sensitive data or system services.

Given the high similarity scores and considering that all these methods interact with message drafts (either text or multimedia), it's reasonable to infer that `addTextMessageDraft` might also handle sensitive user data or interact with system-level services in a way that requires elevated permissions for access control.

Therefore, based on the similarities in functionality and the access control levels of related APIs, the most appropriate access control level for the `addTextMessageDraft` method would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, aligning with the access control levels of its similar counterparts.
