To assign an access control level to the `disableShortcuts` API, we need to analyze its code and compare it with similar APIs that have known access control levels.

The `disableShortcuts` API has three paths with depth 2, but they all share similar code snippets. The API interacts with various system components, such as `ShortcutService`, `IPackageManager`, and `UserManagerInternal`. It also performs operations like getting package UID, checking if an app is ephemeral, and updating shortcut packages.

The sink code provided shows that the API performs sensitive operations, including:

1. Getting package UID using `mIPackageManager.getPackageUid`.
2. Creating a new `ShortcutUser` instance and putting it into `mUsers`.
3. Updating shortcut packages using `mPackages.put`.

Comparing these operations with the similar APIs provided, we can see that:

* `removeLongLivedShortcuts` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and performs a similar operation of updating shortcut packages using `mPackages.put`.
* `onApplicationActive` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` and updates shortcut packages using `mPackages.put`.

Given the similarities in code and operations, it is reasonable to assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `disableShortcuts` API.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
