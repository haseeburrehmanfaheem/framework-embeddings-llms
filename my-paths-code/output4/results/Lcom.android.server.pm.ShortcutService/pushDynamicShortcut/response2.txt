Based on the provided information and the similarity scores with other APIs, it appears that the `pushDynamicShortcut` method is related to shortcut management and interacts with package managers and application info.

The similar APIs, `enableShortcuts` and `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. The code snippets provided for these similar APIs show interactions with the package manager and application info, similar to the `pushDynamicShortcut` method.

Given this information, it is likely that the `pushDynamicShortcut` method also requires system or signature-level permissions to execute, as it interacts with sensitive components such as package managers and application info.

Therefore, based on the similarity scores and the access control levels of the similar APIs, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `pushDynamicShortcut` method.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
