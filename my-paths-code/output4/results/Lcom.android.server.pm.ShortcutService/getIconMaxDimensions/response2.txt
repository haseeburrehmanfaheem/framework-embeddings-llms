To assign an access control level to the `getIconMaxDimensions` API, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The API has multiple paths, but all of them involve interactions with package management and shortcut services, including checking for ephemeral apps.
2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves getting a package UID and checking if an app is ephemeral, which suggests interactions that could potentially require permission or specific access levels.
3. **Similar APIs**:
   - `enableShortcuts` and `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs are very similar in terms of functionality and the code snippets provided, indicating they perform operations that likely require system or signature-level permissions to execute, given their ability to manipulate shortcuts and interact with package management at a potentially sensitive level.

Given these points:

- The interaction with package management (`getPackageUid`) and shortcut services (`getApplicationInfo`, `isEphemeralApp`) suggests that the operation might not be entirely innocuous or freely accessible. 
- The similar APIs, which have a high similarity score and are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control, perform operations that can modify or affect system-level functionalities (enabling shortcuts, removing dynamic shortcuts), implying they need elevated permissions.
- However, `getIconMaxDimensions` seems to be more about retrieving information rather than modifying system state. Despite this, its interaction with potentially sensitive package and app information might still warrant a level of access control.

Considering the above analysis and given that `getIconMaxDimensions` involves checking for ephemeral apps and getting package UIDs (which could be considered sensitive operations), but does not seem to modify any system state directly, it's reasonable to consider an access control level that reflects its need for some level of permission or protection. However, since it's primarily a getter method without direct modification capabilities, the most restrictive levels like `SYS_OR_SIG` might be more than what's necessary unless the information it returns is considered highly sensitive.

Given the provided options and considering the API does not directly modify system state but deals with potentially sensitive operations:

The final answer is: 
```json
{ "access_control_level": "NORMAL" }
```
This choice reflects a balance between the need for some level of access control due to its interactions with package management and shortcut services, and the fact that it's primarily an informational method without direct system modification capabilities.
