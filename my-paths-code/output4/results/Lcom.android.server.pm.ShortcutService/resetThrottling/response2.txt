To assign an access control level to the `resetThrottling` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs. 

The `resetThrottling` method involves several operations:
1. It checks the calling user's ID using `ShortcutService.injectBinderCallingUid()` and `IShortcutService$Stub.getCallingUid()`.
2. It retrieves and updates information about unlocked users, specifically checking if a user is unlocking or unlocked.
3. It loads and saves shortcut user data for specific users.

Given these operations, the method interacts with sensitive user data and system settings related to shortcuts and user unlock status.

Looking at the similar APIs:
- `hasShareTargets` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API also deals with checking unlocked users and loading shortcut user data.
- `getShareTargets` similarly has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, involving operations like updating the last locked user, loading a shortcut user, and putting data into `this.mUsers`.

Both similar APIs have system or signature-level access controls due to their interaction with sensitive data and system internals. The `resetThrottling` method performs comparable operations, including checking user unlock status, loading and saving user-specific data, and interacting with the package manager.

Given these similarities and the nature of operations performed by `resetThrottling`, it is reasonable to conclude that this method should also have a system or signature-level access control. This level of access control is necessary because the method deals with sensitive operations related to user management and system settings, similar to the provided API examples.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `resetThrottling` API in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
