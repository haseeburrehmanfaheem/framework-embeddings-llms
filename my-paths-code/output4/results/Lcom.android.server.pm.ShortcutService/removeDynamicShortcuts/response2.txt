Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method.

The method has three paths with depth 2, and all of them interact with the same sinks. The sinks are related to package management, shortcut handling, and user management.

The similar APIs provided, `enableShortcuts` and `removeAllDynamicShortcuts`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the same sinks as the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method.

Given the similarity in code and sinks between the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method and the similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the access control level for the `removeDynamicShortcuts` method should be the same as the similar APIs.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `removeDynamicShortcuts` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This access control level indicates that the method requires system or signature-level permission to execute, which is consistent with the sensitive operations it performs on shortcuts and package management.
