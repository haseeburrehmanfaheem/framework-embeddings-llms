Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `onApplicationActive` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `onApplicationActive` method interacts with several sinks, including:

1. User unlocking checks: `boolean v5 = p0.isUserUnlockedL(p2);` and `boolean v8 = ShortcutService.isUserUnlockedL(p2);`
2. Shortcut package management: `ShortcutPackage v18 = new ShortcutPackage(ShortcutUser,this.mUserId,p1);` and `Object v20 = this.mPackages.put(p1, v18);`
3. File operations: `File v24 = new File(v25,"shortcuts.xml");`, `AtomicFile v29 = new AtomicFile(v23);`, `v31.flush();`, and `v29.finishWrite(v31);`

The similar APIs, `removeLongLivedShortcuts` and `disableShortcuts`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with shortcut package management and have similar code patterns.

Considering the similarities between the `onApplicationActive` method and the provided similar APIs, I conclude that the access control level for the `onApplicationActive` method should be `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because the method performs operations that require system or signature-level permissions, such as managing shortcut packages and interacting with user unlocking checks.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
