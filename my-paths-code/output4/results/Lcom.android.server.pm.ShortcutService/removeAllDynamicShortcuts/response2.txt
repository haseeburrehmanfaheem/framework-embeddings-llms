Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level for the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method.

The sink code snippets show interactions with package management, user management, and shortcut management, which are sensitive operations. The similar APIs, `enableShortcuts` and `pushDynamicShortcut`, have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to execute.

Given the similarity in code structure and functionality between `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` and the similar APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` also requires a high level of access control.

Therefore, the final access control level for the `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` method is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment is based on the similarity in code and functionality with other APIs that have been assigned the `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, indicating that `removeAllDynamicShortcuts` likely requires system or signature-level permission to execute.
