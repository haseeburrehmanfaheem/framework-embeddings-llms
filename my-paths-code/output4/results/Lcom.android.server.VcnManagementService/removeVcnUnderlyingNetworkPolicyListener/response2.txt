To determine the access control level for the `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similarity with Other APIs**:
   - The method has a high similarity score (0.9943732023239136) with `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, which has an access control level of `NORMAL`. This suggests that both methods might require similar levels of access control since they are closely related in functionality.
   - It also has a significant similarity score (0.958786129951477) with `setVcnConfig`, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method, however, involves setting a configuration and requires a signature or system-level permission, indicating it deals with more sensitive operations.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The code snippet for `removeVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener` involves creating a synthetic lambda (`VcnManagementService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3`) and using `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`. This pattern is also seen in the `setVcnConfig` method, which has a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level. The use of `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity` often implies that the method is performing operations that require careful handling of the calling identity, typically to prevent leaks or to ensure that sensitive operations are executed with the appropriate permissions.

3. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code involves the creation of a lambda object (`VcnManagementService$$ExternalSyntheticLambda3`), which is similar to the pattern observed in `setVcnConfig`. This could imply that the operation has some level of sensitivity or requires specific permissions to execute correctly.

Given these points, while the method shares a high degree of similarity with `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, which has a `NORMAL` access control level, its operational pattern (using `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity`) and the nature of its similar APIs suggest that it might require more than just normal permissions to ensure secure execution. However, without explicit evidence of it requiring system or signature-level permissions like `setVcnConfig`, we can infer that its access control level is likely aligned closer to `NORMAL` due to its functional similarity with `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`. The use of `Binder.withCleanCallingIdentity` in both this method and `setVcnConfig` indicates a need for careful permission handling, but the absence of additional sensitive operations (as might be implied by the need for `SYS_OR_SIG` access) in the provided snippet suggests that `NORMAL` could be an appropriate access control level.

**Final Access Control Level:**

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This determination is based on the method's similarity to other APIs, particularly `addVcnUnderlyingNetworkPolicyListener`, and the nature of its operations, which do not explicitly indicate a need for system or signature-level permissions.
