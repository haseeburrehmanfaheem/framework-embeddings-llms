To assign an access control level to the `getConfiguredSubscriptionGroups` method, we need to analyze its code snippet, sink code, and similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method `getConfiguredSubscriptionGroups` takes a `String` parameter `p1`.
   - It retrieves the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and checks if the user is a system user via `UserHandle.getUserHandleForUid(v6).isSystem()`.
   - Although it iterates over a set of keys (`this.mConfigs.keySet()`), it doesn't actually use the iteration to populate the returned list, which remains empty.
   - The method returns an empty `ArrayList`.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**:
   - The sink code simply initializes and returns an empty `ArrayList`.
   - There's no interaction with sensitive data or system resources that could pose a security risk.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **API Name: `getBlockedRatings(I)Ljava/util/List;`** with a Similarity Score of 0.9548688530921936 and an Access Control Level of `NONE`.
     - This API also returns an empty list, similar to the sink code of `getConfiguredSubscriptionGroups`.
   - **API Name: `getAvailableTvStreamConfigList(Ljava/lang/String;I)Ljava/util/List;`** with a Similarity Score of 0.8825979232788086 and an Access Control Level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
     - This method involves system or signature-level permissions, indicated by its access control level, but its similarity score suggests some operational similarities with `getConfiguredSubscriptionGroups`, albeit with different parameter types and presumably different internal logic related to TV stream configurations.

**Decision**:
Given that the `getConfiguredSubscriptionGroups` method does not interact with sensitive data, does not perform any operations that could compromise security or privacy, and based on its similarity with other APIs (especially `getBlockedRatings` which has a high similarity score and is assigned `NONE` as its access control level), it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of `NONE` to this method. The method's current implementation does not leverage the system user check or the iteration over configurations in a manner that would necessitate higher access control levels like `NORMAL`, `DANGEROUS`, or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
