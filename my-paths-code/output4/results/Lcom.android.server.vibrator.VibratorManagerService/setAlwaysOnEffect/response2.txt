To determine the access control level for the `setAlwaysOnEffect` method, we should consider the semantics of this API and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Semantics of `setAlwaysOnEffect`:** This method is involved in setting up a vibration effect that is always on. It interacts with vibration attributes and effects, suggesting it has control over device hardware (vibrator). The method modifies internal states (`this.mAlwaysOnEffects.put(p3, v45);`) and updates other components (`p0.updateAlwaysOnLocked(v45);`), indicating it has some level of access to system resources.

2. **Comparison with Similar APIs:**
   - The similar APIs provided (`cancelVibrate(ILandroid/os/IBinder;)V`) have an access control level of `NORMAL`. These APIs are also related to vibration management but are focused on canceling vibrations rather than setting them up.
   - Both similar APIs interact with system resources (e.g., ending a vibration, recording vibration data) but do not seem to pose a significant risk in terms of privacy or security breaches directly. However, controlling device hardware could potentially be used maliciously if not properly regulated.

3. **Access Control Levels:**
   - `NONE`: Typically for APIs that do not interact with sensitive data or system resources.
   - `NORMAL`: For APIs that have some level of interaction with system resources but are generally considered safe when used as intended.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Applies to APIs that can pose a significant risk if misused, such as those directly affecting user privacy or device security.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Usually for system-level or signature-protected permissions that require special access.

Considering the above points:
- The `setAlwaysOnEffect` method interacts with system resources (vibrator) and modifies internal states but doesn't seem to directly pose significant risks in terms of privacy or security breaches. 
- It's similar to the provided APIs in terms of resource interaction but is focused on setting up rather than canceling vibrations.
- Given its functionality, it likely requires some level of access control but does not reach the threshold of being considered `DANGEROUS` or requiring system/signature-level protection (`SYS_OR_SIG`).

**Conclusion:**
The `setAlwaysOnEffect` method should be assigned an access control level that reflects its need for managed access to system resources without posing a direct significant threat. Therefore, it aligns most closely with the `NORMAL` access control level, similar to the provided APIs but considering its specific functionality and potential impact.
