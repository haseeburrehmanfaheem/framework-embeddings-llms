To assign an access control level to the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method, we should analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

All three code paths for `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` involve clearing and restoring the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`, respectively. This is a common pattern used to perform operations without affecting the caller's identity, which can be crucial in system services or when dealing with sensitive data.

The similar APIs provided, such as `keyguardGoingAway` and `startInputOrWindowGainedFocus`, also use this pattern and have been assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that operations involving clearing and restoring the calling identity are typically restricted to system or signature-level access due to their potential impact on system security and functionality.

Given the similarities in code patterns and the context provided by the similar APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `removeRootTasksWithActivityTypes` method should also be assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This is because altering task states or performing operations that require temporary changes to the calling identity could have system-wide implications and thus should be restricted to trusted components.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
