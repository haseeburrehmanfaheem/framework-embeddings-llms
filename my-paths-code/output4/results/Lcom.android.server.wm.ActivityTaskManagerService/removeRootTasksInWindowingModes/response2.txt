To determine the access control level for the `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes` method, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Code Snippets Analysis**:
   - The method has three paths with similar operations:
     - It clears the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`.
     - It accesses or manipulates some internal state (`this.mChildren.size()`).
     - It restores the calling identity using `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`.
     - In one of the paths, it also boosts and then resets the thread priority using `WindowManagerThreadPriorityBooster.boost()` and `.reset()`.
   - The presence of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` suggests that this method is interacting with system-level components or services that require identity management for security or logging purposes.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **API Name: `removeHotplugEventListener(Landroid/hardware/hdmi/IHdmiHotplugEventListener;)V`**:
     - Similarity Score: Very high (1.0000001192092896), indicating a strong similarity in either functionality, parameters, or both.
     - Access Control Level: **SYS_OR_SIG**, which suggests that this API requires system-level permissions or signature-level access control. This is plausible given its interaction with hardware events (HDMI hotplug).
   - **API Name: `setVrThread(I)V`**:
     - Similarity Score: Also very high (1.0000001192092896), indicating strong similarity.
     - Access Control Level: **NONE**, suggesting that this API does not require special permissions or access control.

3. **Determining Access Control for `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`**:
   - Given the operations within `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`, it's clear that the method interacts with system-level components (e.g., managing tasks in windowing modes, which could be related to how Android manages multitasking or split-screen functionalities).
   - The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` indicates a need for secure interaction with system services, suggesting at least some level of access control.
   - Comparing the similar APIs:
     - `removeHotplugEventListener` requires **SYS_OR_SIG** access due to its hardware-related functionality, which might not directly apply to `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`.
     - `setVrThread` has **NONE**, but given the nature of `removeRootTasksInWindowingModes`, it seems less likely that no access control is needed.

Given these considerations and focusing on the interaction with system-level components without explicit hardware interaction (like `removeHotplugEventListener`), a balanced approach would be to consider an access control level that reflects its need for secure, potentially privileged operations but does not necessarily interact directly with sensitive hardware events or require signature-level permissions.

**Conclusion**: Considering the method's functionality and the presence of identity management calls (`Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`), which suggest a need for some form of access control to ensure that only authorized components can manipulate task states, but without direct evidence of requiring system or signature level access like hardware event handling APIs, an appropriate access control level could be **NORMAL**. This choice balances the method's interaction with system-level task management against the lack of explicit sensitive hardware or direct system service interactions.
