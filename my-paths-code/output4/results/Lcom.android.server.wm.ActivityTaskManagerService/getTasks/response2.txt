To assign an access control level to the `getTasks` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs. 

The `getTasks` API has three paths, but they all share a common pattern: 
1. It checks the calling user's ID using `UserManagerService.checkQueryOrCreateUsersPermission`.
2. It retrieves profile IDs related to a given user.
3. It logs some warnings and debug messages.
4. It iterates over tasks and returns them in an `ArrayList`.

The similar APIs provided are:
- `getRecentTasks`: This API has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It handles incoming users, loads recent tasks for a specific user, and returns a list of tasks.
- `getLastResumedActivityUserId`: This API also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It simply returns the current user's ID.

Both similar APIs have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level because they are related to system internals or require signature-level permissions. 

Looking at the `getTasks` API, we can see that:
- It calls `UserManagerService.checkQueryOrCreateUsersPermission`, which implies that it needs some level of permission to query user data.
- It retrieves profile IDs for a given user and iterates over tasks, suggesting that it requires access to system-level information.

Given these observations and the similarity with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, we can infer that the `getTasks` API likely requires a similar level of access control.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" \}}$
