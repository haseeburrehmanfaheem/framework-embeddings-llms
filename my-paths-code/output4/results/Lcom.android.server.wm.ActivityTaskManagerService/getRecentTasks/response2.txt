Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `getRecentTasks` API.

The `getRecentTasks` API has a similarity score of over 0.8 with two other APIs: `startActivities` and `startActivityFromGameSession`. Both of these APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Looking at the code snippet of `getRecentTasks`, we can see that it interacts with sensitive data, such as recent tasks and user IDs, which requires a certain level of access control. The API also calls `handleIncomingUser`, which is similar to the other two APIs.

Given the similarity in functionality and code structure, it's likely that `getRecentTasks` requires a similar level of access control as `startActivities` and `startActivityFromGameSession`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `getRecentTasks` API.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This decision is made by considering the similarity in code structure and functionality with other APIs that have a known access control level, as well as the interaction with sensitive data that requires a certain level of access control.
