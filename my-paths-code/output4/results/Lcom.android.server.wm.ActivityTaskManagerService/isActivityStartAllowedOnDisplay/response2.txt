To determine the access control level for the `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` method involves several steps:

1. Resolving an intent using `ActivityTaskSupervisor.resolveIntent`.
2. Resolving an activity using `ActivityTaskSupervisor.resolveActivity`.
3. Getting activity information for a user using `this.mAmInternal.getActivityInfoForUser`.
4. Checking if the caller is allowed to launch on display using `ActivityTaskSupervisor.isCallerAllowedToLaunchOnDisplay`.
5. Getting display content or creating it if necessary using `this.mRootWindowContainer.getDisplayContentOrCreate`.

The method does not seem to perform any operations that directly modify system state or handle sensitive data in a way that would require elevated permissions like `DANGEROUS`. However, the interactions with activity resolution, user activity information, and display management suggest that this method is related to managing how activities are started and displayed, which could be security-sensitive.

The similar APIs provided also offer insights:

1. `startActivities` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature permissions. This method directly starts activities, which can have significant implications for the system's state and user experience.
2. `setFocusedTask` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It deals with setting the focused task and updating the focused window, which affects how the system interacts with the user.

Given these points:

- The method `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` does not directly modify sensitive data or perform actions that require high-level permissions like `DANGEROUS`.
- However, it is involved in determining whether an activity can be started on a display, which has implications for security and system management.
- Similar APIs (`startActivities` and `setFocusedTask`) have `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels due to their impact on system state and user experience.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate access control level for `isActivityStartAllowedOnDisplay` seems to be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it deals with system-level decisions about activity management but does not directly handle sensitive data modifications or require dangerous permissions.
