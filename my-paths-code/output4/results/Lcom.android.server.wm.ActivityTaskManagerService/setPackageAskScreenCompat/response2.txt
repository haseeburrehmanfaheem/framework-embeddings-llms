To determine the access control level for the `setPackageAskScreenCompat` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `setPackageAskScreenCompat` method involves the following key operations:
1. It retrieves package flags using `CompatModePackages.getPackageFlags(p1)`.
2. It puts a value into `this.mPackages` based on the `phiInstruction`.
3. It schedules a write operation with `CompatModePackages.scheduleWrite()`.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- **requestNothing([BZ)V**: This method has an access control level of `NONE`. Its operations involve writing package status and optimistic lock checks, which seem unrelated to the direct manipulation of package flags or scheduling writes as seen in `setPackageAskScreenCompat`.

- **takePersistableUriPermission(Landroid/net/Uri;ILjava/lang/String;I)V**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its operations involve getting a package UID, creating a new `GrantUri` object, and accessing granted URI permissions. While it deals with system-level permissions, the nature of its interactions (URI permissions) is different from directly manipulating package flags.

Given these comparisons:
- The method `setPackageAskScreenCompat` does not directly interact with sensitive data like URI permissions or involve complex permission checks that would necessitate a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.
- It also doesn't simply write data without any implications on system state, which might suggest a need for `NONE` or `NORMAL` access control.

However, considering the method's involvement in setting package flags and scheduling writes to compatibility mode packages, it implies a level of interaction with system settings that could potentially impact how applications behave or are managed by the system. This kind of operation doesn't seem entirely benign (thus not `NONE`) but also does not directly imply a dangerous or signature/system-level access requirement as seen in `SYS_OR_SIG` cases.

Therefore, considering the provided information and comparisons, the most appropriate access control level for the `setPackageAskScreenCompat` method seems to be `NORMAL`. This is because it involves system-related operations (setting package flags and scheduling writes) that are not entirely trivial but do not clearly fall into the more sensitive categories implied by `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG`.
