To determine the access control level for the `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` method has three different paths, but they all share a common sink code that involves creating an `ArrayList`, using a lambda expression to iterate over root tasks, and returning the list. The key aspects of this method are:

1. **Use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5)`**: This indicates that the method is aware of the caller's identity and temporarily clears it, which is often used in system-level operations to ensure security and proper handling of identities.
2. **Iteration over root tasks using `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks(v14, 1)`**: This shows interaction with window containers, which could potentially involve sensitive information about running tasks or windows on the display.
3. **Return of an `ArrayList` containing task information**: The method returns a list of task information, which might include details about running applications or system processes.

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- **`finishVoiceTask(Landroid/service/voice/IVoiceInteractionSession;)V`** has an access control level of `NONE`. This API interacts with voice interaction sessions and also uses `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks`, but it does not return sensitive information directly. Its similarity score is high (0.9277772307395935), indicating that the operations and context are somewhat comparable to `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay`.

- **`getAllRootTaskInfos()Ljava/util/List;`** has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method returns a list of all root task information, similar to `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay`, but without the specific filter of being "on display." Its similarity score (0.924764096736908) is also very high, indicating that these methods share significant operational similarities.

Given these observations:

- Both similar APIs interact with system-level components (`WindowContainer` and task information).
- The method in question returns potentially sensitive information about tasks on the display.
- The use of `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5)` suggests a need to manage caller identity securely, which is often associated with system-level or signature-protected operations.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate access control level for `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` would be `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it deals with potentially sensitive task information and operates within a context that requires careful management of identities and permissions, similar to the `getAllRootTaskInfos()` method.
