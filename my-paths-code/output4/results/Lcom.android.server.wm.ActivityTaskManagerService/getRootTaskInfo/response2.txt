Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `getRootTaskInfo` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `getRootTaskInfo` method is used to retrieve information about a root task in the system. It takes two integer parameters, `p1` and `p2`, and returns an `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo` object containing details about the root task.

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `getFocusedRootTaskInfo()`: This method has a similarity score of 0.8814712762832642 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It retrieves information about the currently focused root task.
2. `startActivityAsUser()`: This method has a similarity score of 0.8338523507118225 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It starts an activity as a specific user.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access the relevant information.

Analyzing the code snippets provided for the `getRootTaskInfo` method, it appears that this method is also retrieving sensitive information about root tasks in the system. The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()` to manage the calling identity, which suggests that it is accessing system-level information.

Given the similarity in functionality and access control levels between the `getRootTaskInfo` method and its similar APIs, I conclude that the appropriate access control level for the `getRootTaskInfo` method is also `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
