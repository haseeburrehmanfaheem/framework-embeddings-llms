To determine the access control level for the `startActivityWithConfig` method, let's analyze its code snippet and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The method involves starting an activity with a specific configuration.
   - It uses `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()` to get the PID and UID of the caller, which are then handled by `this.mAmInternal.handleIncomingUser()`. This suggests interaction with user management and potentially sensitive operations.
   - The method sets various parameters for the activity starter, including the caller, calling package, feature ID, resolved type, result to, result who, request code, start flags, global configuration, and activity options. These operations are typical for starting activities in Android but can involve sensitive data and operations.
   - The presence of `SafeActivityOptions` and handling of `ActivityOptions` from a bundle indicates careful handling of potentially sensitive or restricted data.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - Both similar APIs (`startActivityFromGameSession`) have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating they are system-internal or require a significant permission level, likely due to their interaction with game sessions and the need to manage activities securely within that context.
   - These APIs also deal with setting up activity starters with various parameters and handling activity options securely, similar to `startActivityWithConfig`.

3. **Comparison and Decision**:
   - Given the similarities in operation (starting activities with specific configurations and secure handling of options) and the system-internal nature suggested by both similar APIs having a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that `startActivityWithConfig` also requires a significant level of access control.
   - The method's interaction with user management (`handleIncomingUser`) and its role in starting activities securely across different configurations also point towards the need for strict access control.

Based on this analysis, assigning an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to `startActivityWithConfig` seems appropriate due to its system-internal nature and the potential sensitivity of operations involved.
