To determine the access control level for the `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Similar APIs and Their Access Control Levels:**
   - `moveRootTaskToDisplay(II)V` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This API involves moving a root task to a different display, which implies a need for system or signature-level permission due to its potential impact on the system's UI and security.
   - `getRootTaskInfo(II)Landroid/app/ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo;` also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This method retrieves information about a root task, which could be sensitive and thus requires higher permission levels to protect user privacy and system integrity.

2. **Code Snippets of getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay:**
   - The method involves getting the display content using `RootWindowContainer.getDisplayContent(p3)`, retrieving a root task with `v11.getRootTask(p1, p2)`, and filling an `ActivityTaskManager$RootTaskInfo` object with various details about the task (such as bounds, descendant task count, child task IDs, names, bounds, and user IDs).
   - The method uses `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(v5)` to manage the calling identity, which is a common pattern in Android system services to ensure that operations are performed with the correct permissions and identity.

3. **Sink Code Analysis:**
   - The sink code snippet shows interactions with display content and tasks, similar to the APIs mentioned above. It focuses on retrieving task information without modifying system state directly, suggesting it might not require as high a permission level as methods that alter system state (like `moveRootTaskToDisplay`).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the similarity in functionality between `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` and other APIs like `getRootTaskInfo`, which have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, it's reasonable to infer that `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` would also require a similar level of protection.
   - The method's focus on retrieving information rather than modifying system state slightly reduces the risk, but considering the sensitive nature of the information (task details) and the need to protect system integrity and user privacy, a higher access control level is justified.

Based on this analysis, the `getRootTaskInfoOnDisplay` method should have an access control level that reflects its need for protection similar to other system APIs dealing with task management and display content. Therefore, the access control level for this API would be:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
```

This conclusion is drawn by considering the API's functionality, the sensitivity of the information it handles, and the precedent set by similar APIs in the Android system.
