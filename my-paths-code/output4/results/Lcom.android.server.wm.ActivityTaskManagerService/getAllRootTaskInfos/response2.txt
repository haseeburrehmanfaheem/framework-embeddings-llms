To determine the access control level for the `getAllRootTaskInfos` method, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with the similar APIs provided.

The `getAllRootTaskInfos` method has three paths with depth 2, but they all share a common pattern:
1. They clear the calling identity using `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`.
2. They create an instance of `ArrayList` to store task information.
3. They use `RootWindowContainer.getChildCount()` and create an instance of `RootWindowContainer$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12` to iterate over all root tasks.
4. They call `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks()` with the lambda instance and a flag (1).
5. They restore the calling identity using `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity()`.

The sink code is also provided, which includes the key operations:
- Getting the child count of `RootWindowContainer`.
- Creating an instance of `RootWindowContainer$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12` to iterate over tasks.
- Calling `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks()` with the lambda and a flag.
- Returning the list of task information.

Now, comparing this with the similar APIs:

1. **API Name: getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay(I)Ljava/util/List;** 
   - Similarity Score: 0.924764096736908
   - Access Control Level: SYS_OR_SIG
   - The code snippet shows a very similar pattern to `getAllRootTaskInfos`, including creating an `ArrayList`, using `RootWindowContainer$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12` to iterate tasks, and calling `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks()`. Given the high similarity score and the access control level being SYS_OR_SIG, this suggests that accessing task information on a specific display requires system or signature-level permission.

2. **API Name: finishVoiceTask(Landroid/service/voice/IVoiceInteractionSession;)V**
   - Similarity Score: 0.8752995729446411
   - Access Control Level: NONE
   - Although this method involves interacting with tasks (using `WindowContainer.forAllRootTasks()`), its purpose and context are different from `getAllRootTaskInfos`. The lower similarity score and the access control level being NONE indicate that finishing a voice task does not require special permissions in the same way accessing all root task information might.

Given these observations:
- The `getAllRootTaskInfos` method involves sensitive operations related to task management, similar to `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay`, which has an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
- The method iterates over all root tasks and returns their information, which could be considered a privileged operation requiring system-level permission.

Therefore, considering the similarity with `getAllRootTaskInfosOnDisplay` and the nature of operations involved in `getAllRootTaskInfos`, it's reasonable to conclude that this method should also have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG to protect sensitive task information and ensure that only authorized components can access such details.
