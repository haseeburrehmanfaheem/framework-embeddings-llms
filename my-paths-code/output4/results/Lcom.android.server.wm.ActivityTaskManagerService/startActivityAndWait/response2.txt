To determine the access control level for the `startActivityAndWait` method, let's analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

1. **Code Analysis**: The `startActivityAndWait` method involves several steps related to starting an activity, including obtaining an `ActivityStarter`, setting various properties like intent, caller, calling package, resolved type, result-to, result-who, request code, start flags, and executing the activity starter with a wait result. This process is complex and interacts with sensitive components of the Android system, such as activity management and user identification.

2. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - **startAssistantActivity**: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires either system or signature-level permission to execute due to its interaction with sensitive functionality (starting an assistant activity). Its code shows similarities in obtaining an `ActivityStarter` and setting properties like intent and calling UID.
   - **startActivityFromGameSession**: Also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It involves setting the caller, calling UID, PID, package, and feature ID, which are sensitive operations requiring elevated permissions.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both similar APIs deal with starting activities under specific conditions (assistant activity and from a game session) and require system or signature-level access due to their sensitivity.
   - The `startActivityAndWait` method, while differing in specifics, shares the core functionality of interacting with the activity starter and setting sensitive properties. It also involves user ID handling (`setUserId`) and profiler info, which can be considered sensitive operations.

4. **Access Control Determination**:
   Given the complexity, sensitivity of operations (e.g., `handleIncomingUser`, `setCaller`, `setCallingPackage`, `setUserId`), and the comparison with similar APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level, it's reasonable to conclude that the `startActivityAndWait` method should also require system or signature-level permission. This is because it deals with potentially sensitive data and operations that could impact system security or user privacy if not properly restricted.

**Final Access Control Level**:
```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
This determination is based on the method's interaction with sensitive system components, its similarity to other APIs requiring elevated permissions, and the potential risks associated with unauthorized access to such functionality.
