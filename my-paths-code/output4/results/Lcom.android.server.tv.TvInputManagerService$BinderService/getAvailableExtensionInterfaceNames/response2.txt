To determine the access control level for the `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar APIs.

The `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` method involves the following key operations:

1. It retrieves the user state using `TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2)`, which is a common operation among the compared APIs.
2. It accesses the input map and service state map within the user state, which is similar to the operations in the provided APIs.
3. The method does not perform any sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions (e.g., no direct access to external storage, camera, location, etc.).

Comparing this with the similar APIs:

- `captureFrame` has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, which suggests it requires system or signature-level permission due to its interaction with potentially sensitive resources (e.g., capturing frames from a surface). However, its similarity score is high (0.9303160905838013), indicating that the operational context might be somewhat comparable.

- `getTvInputState` has an access control level of `NONE`, suggesting it does not require any special permissions beyond what's normally available to apps. Its similarity score is also relatively high (0.8772438168525696), indicating some operational similarities with `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames`.

Given these observations:

- The method `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` does not seem to engage in operations that would necessitate system or signature-level permissions based on the provided information.
- It primarily deals with retrieving and manipulating internal state related to TV input services, which aligns more closely with the less restrictive access control observed in `getTvInputState`.

Therefore, considering the operational context and similarities with other APIs, especially the lack of sensitive operations that would require elevated permissions, the most appropriate access control level for `getAvailableExtensionInterfaceNames` appears to be `NONE`.

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```
However, given the details provided and reevaluating the method's interactions which involve user state management and service state queries without direct implications on sensitive user data or system resources that would strictly require `SYS_OR_SIG` permissions but still imply a need for controlled access beyond `NONE`, it suggests a reconsideration towards an access control that reflects its operational scope more accurately. Thus, aligning with the nature of its operations and comparisons:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "NORMAL"
}
```

This adjustment reflects the method's involvement in managed service interactions which typically fall under a controlled or normal access category, balancing between the unrestricted `NONE` and the more privileged `SYS_OR_SIG` levels.
