To determine the access control level for the `setCaptionEnabled` method, we need to analyze its code paths and compare them with the provided similar APIs.

All three code paths for `setCaptionEnabled` share similar structures, involving:

1. Getting the calling UID and PID.
2. Handling the incoming user using `ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser`.
3. Acquiring a lock and getting session states and an `ITvInputSession` instance.
4. In two out of the three paths, it calls `setCaptionEnabled` on the `ITvInputSession` instance.

The sink code provided focuses on specific lines within these paths, including handling the incoming user, getting session states, and setting caption enabled.

The similar APIs provided are:

- `setInteractiveAppNotificationEnabled`: With a high similarity score (0.9715989232063293) and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
- `timeShiftEnablePositionTracking`: Also with a high similarity score (0.9700949192047119) and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Both similar APIs have the same access control level (`SYS_OR_SIG`), which suggests that operations related to enabling or disabling features on `ITvInputSession` instances are considered sensitive and require system or signature-level permissions.

Given this analysis:

- The method's interaction with system services (like `ActivityManager`) and its impact on device settings (enabling/disabling captions) imply a level of sensitivity.
- The high similarity scores with other APIs that have a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level indicate that the operations performed by `setCaptionEnabled` are likely to be considered as requiring similar levels of permission.

Therefore, based on the code paths and the similarities with other APIs, it's reasonable to conclude that the `setCaptionEnabled` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.
