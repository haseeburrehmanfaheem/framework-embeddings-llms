To determine the access control level for the `getBlockedRatings` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The method has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve getting the calling PID and UID, handling incoming users, clearing and restoring calling identity, and interacting with `TvInputManagerService$UserState`. Both paths also include loading from a `PersistentDataStore` and returning an `ArrayList`.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code involves retrieving or creating a `TvInputManagerService$UserState` and putting it into `mUserStates`, as well as creating and returning an empty `ArrayList`.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **isRatingBlocked(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z**: This API has a similarity score of 1.0 with `getBlockedRatings`. It interacts with `TvInputManagerService$UserState` in a similar manner (retrieving or creating and storing it). Its access control level is NONE.
   - **getTvInputState(Ljava/lang/String;I)I**: With a similarity score of 0.9570844769477844, this API also deals with `TvInputManagerService$UserState` similarly. Its access control level is NONE.

**Analysis**:
- Both similar APIs have an access control level of NONE, indicating that they do not require special permissions to execute.
- The `getBlockedRatings` method's interactions with system services and data storage (e.g., `PersistentDataStore`) are encapsulated within the context of managing TV input states, which seems to be a controlled environment based on the provided similar APIs.
- There is no clear indication that this method accesses sensitive information or performs actions that would require elevated permissions (like those classified as DANGEROUS) or system-level access (SYS_OR_SIG).
- The creation and return of an empty `ArrayList` do not inherently suggest any risk or need for heightened access control.

**Conclusion**: Given the similarities in functionality with other APIs categorized under NONE, and without explicit indicators of sensitive data access or dangerous operations, it's reasonable to assign the same access control level to `getBlockedRatings`.
