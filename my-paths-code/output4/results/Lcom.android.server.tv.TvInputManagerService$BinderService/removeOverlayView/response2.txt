To determine the access control level for the `removeOverlayView` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippets**: The code snippets for `removeOverlayView` show that it interacts with the `ITvInputSession` interface to remove an overlay view. This interaction is protected by a lock (`TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock(this.this$0)`) and involves clearing and restoring the calling identity, which suggests some level of security consideration.

2. **Sink Code**: The sink code specifically mentions `ITvInputSession v8 = v9; v8.removeOverlayView();`, indicating that the method directly impacts the TV input session's overlay view management.

3. **Similar APIs**:
   - **createOverlayView**: This API has a similarity score of 0.8763269782066345 and is assigned an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. It creates an overlay view, which implies that it needs system or signature-level permission to ensure only authorized components can create overlays.
   - **relayoutOverlayView**: With a similarity score of 0.8659109473228455 and also assigned `SYS_OR_SIG`, this method adjusts the layout of an existing overlay view. Similar to creating an overlay, relaying out one would require system or signature-level access to prevent unauthorized modifications.

Given these points:

- The `removeOverlayView` method directly impacts the TV input session by removing an overlay view.
- Both similar APIs (`createOverlayView` and `relayoutOverlayView`) are assigned `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels, indicating that managing overlay views (including creation, adjustment, and presumably removal) requires system or signature-level permissions to maintain security and integrity.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the `removeOverlayView` method should also require a similar level of access control to prevent unauthorized removal of overlay views, which could potentially disrupt the TV input session or be used maliciously.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
