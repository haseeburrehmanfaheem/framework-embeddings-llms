Based on the provided information, I will analyze the `removeBlockedRating` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `removeBlockedRating` method interacts with the following sinks:

* `TvInputManagerService$UserState v13 = TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2);`
* `TvContentRating v18 = TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(p1);`
* `boolean v22 = this.mBlockedRatings.contains(v18);`
* `boolean v23 = this.mBlockedRatings.remove(v18);`

The similar APIs are:

* `addBlockedRating(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` with a similarity score of 0.9024205207824707 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG. This API adds a blocked rating to the list.
* `isRatingBlocked(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z` with a similarity score of 0.885508120059967 and an access control level of NONE. This API checks if a rating is blocked.

Considering the similarities between the APIs, I notice that:

* `addBlockedRating` has a high similarity score and requires SYS_OR_SIG access control, indicating that modifying the blocked ratings list requires system or signature-level permission.
* `isRatingBlocked` has a moderate similarity score and requires NONE access control, indicating that checking if a rating is blocked does not require any special permissions.

Given that `removeBlockedRating` modifies the blocked ratings list by removing an entry, it is similar to `addBlockedRating` in terms of functionality. Therefore, I conclude that `removeBlockedRating` should have a similar access control level to `addBlockedRating`, which is SYS_OR_SIG.

The final access control level for the API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```
