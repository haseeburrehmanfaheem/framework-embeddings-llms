Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `getTvInputList` method. 

The method has two paths with similar code snippets, and both involve interacting with the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` class to retrieve a list of TV inputs. The sink code also shows that it is accessing the `inputMap` of the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` class.

Looking at the similar APIs provided, we can see that they have an access control level of `NONE`. These APIs, `getTvInputState` and `getTvInputInfo`, also interact with the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` class to retrieve TV input information. 

Given the similarity in code and functionality between `getTvInputList` and these APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that `getTvInputList` should have a similar access control level.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided information, the final access control level for the `getTvInputList` API is:

```json
{ "access_control_level": "NONE" }
```
