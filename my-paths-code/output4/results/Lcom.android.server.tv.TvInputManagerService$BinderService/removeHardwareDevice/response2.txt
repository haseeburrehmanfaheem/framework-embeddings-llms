Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `removeHardwareDevice` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `removeHardwareDevice` method has two paths with a depth of 2, and both paths involve interacting with the `mConnections` object and sending a message using the `mHandler`. The sink code highlights the specific lines of interest:

1. `Object v3 = this.mConnections.get(p1); v3.resetLocked(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0); this.mConnections.remove(p1);`
2. `Message v13 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(3, 0, 0, v9); v13.sendToTarget();`

The similar APIs provided are:

1. `scheduleNonStrongBiometricIdleTimeout(I)V` with a similarity score of 0.9392408132553101 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.
2. `unregisterStrongAuthTracker(Landroid/app/trust/IStrongAuthTracker;)V` with a similarity score of 0.928413987159729 and an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Both similar APIs have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG, which suggests that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute. The code snippets for these APIs also involve sending messages using a handler, similar to the `removeHardwareDevice` method.

Considering the similarities in code and behavior between the `removeHardwareDevice` method and the provided APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `removeHardwareDevice` method should have an access control level of SYS_OR_SIG.

Here is the final access control level for the API in JSON format:
