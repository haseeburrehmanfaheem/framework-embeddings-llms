Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `requestBroadcastInfo` method and its similar APIs to determine the access control level.

The `requestBroadcastInfo` method has three paths with depth 2, but only two of them contain the sink code that interacts with the `ITvInputSession` interface. The sink code is responsible for calling the `requestBroadcastInfo` method on the `ITvInputSession` object.

The similar APIs provided are `requestAd(Landroid/os/IBinder;Landroid/media/tv/AdRequest;I)V`, which have a similarity score of 0.8856154084205627 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. These APIs also interact with the `ITvInputSession` interface, but they call the `requestAd` method instead.

Given the similarities between the `requestBroadcastInfo` method and the `requestAd` APIs, it is likely that the `requestBroadcastInfo` method requires a similar access control level. The `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level indicates that the API can only be called by system or signature applications, which suggests that the `requestBroadcastInfo` method may also require a similar level of restriction.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the similar APIs and the sink code, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `requestBroadcastInfo` method.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
