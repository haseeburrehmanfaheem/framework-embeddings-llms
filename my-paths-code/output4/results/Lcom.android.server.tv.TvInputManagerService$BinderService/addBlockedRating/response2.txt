To determine the access control level for the `addBlockedRating` API, we need to analyze its code snippet and compare it with similar APIs.

The `addBlockedRating` API has two paths with depth 2, both of which involve the following key operations:

1.  Retrieving the user state using `TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2)`.
2.  Unflattening a string into a `TvContentRating` object using `TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(p1)`.
3.  Checking if the rating is already blocked using `this.mBlockedRatings.contains(v18)` (or `v15` in path 2).
4.  Adding the rating to the blocked list using `this.mBlockedRatings.add(v18)` (or `v15` in path 2).

The sink code for this API involves interactions with `TvInputManagerService$UserState`, `PersistentDataStore`, and `TvContentRating`.

Now, let's examine the similar APIs provided:

*   The `removeBlockedRating(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` API has a similarity score of 0.9024205207824707 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves:
    *   Retrieving the user state using `TvInputManagerService.getUserStateLocked(p2)`.
    *   Unflattening a string into a `TvContentRating` object using `TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(p1)`.
    *   Checking if the rating is blocked using `this.mBlockedRatings.contains(v18)`.
    *   Removing the rating from the blocked list using `this.mBlockedRatings.remove(v18)`.
*   Another instance of `removeBlockedRating(Ljava/lang/String;I)V` has a similarity score of 0.8442290425300598 and an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. Its code involves:
    *   Retrieving the persistent data store using `TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetpersistentDataStore(v11)`.
    *   Unflattening a string into a `TvContentRating` object using `TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(p1)`.
    *   Checking if the rating is blocked using `this.mBlockedRatings.contains(v15)`.
    *   Removing the rating from the blocked list using `this.mBlockedRatings.remove(v15)`.

Given these similarities, we can observe that all APIs (including `addBlockedRating`) are related to managing blocked content ratings and have similar operations. The access control level for both instances of `removeBlockedRating` is `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permissions to execute.

Based on the similarities in code and functionality between `addBlockedRating` and the provided instances of `removeBlockedRating`, it's reasonable to conclude that `addBlockedRating` should have a similar access control level. Therefore, the final access control level for the `addBlockedRating` API is:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
```

This assignment reflects the need for system or signature-level permissions to manage blocked content ratings, ensuring that only authorized components can modify these settings.
