After reviewing the provided information, we can see that the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method has a similar structure to the other two APIs, `unregisterStrongAuthTracker` and `registerStrongAuthTracker`, which both have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. 

All three methods obtain a message from a handler and send it to the target. The similarity in code structure and the high similarity scores (0.9600434303283691 and 0.9596622586250305) suggest that `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` is likely to require a similar access control level.

Given this information, we can conclude that the `removeImeSurfaceFromWindowAsync` method should have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, as it is similar in structure and functionality to the other two APIs with this access control level.
