Based on the provided information, we can analyze the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method and its similar APIs to determine the appropriate access control level.

The `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method has a similarity score of 0.9807563424110413 with the `requireStrongAuth(II)V` API, which has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This suggests that the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method may also require a similar level of access control.

Additionally, the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method has a similarity score of 0.9684304594993591 with the `registerStrongAuthTracker(Landroid/app/trust/IStrongAuthTracker;)V` API, which also has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`. This further supports the idea that the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method may require a `SYS_OR_SIG` access control level.

The code snippet for the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` method shows that it sends a message to a handler using `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget`, which is similar to the code snippets of the similar APIs. This suggests that the method is interacting with a system-level component, which may require a higher level of access control.

Based on this analysis, I would assign an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG` to the `showInputMethodPickerFromSystem` API.

{ "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG" }
