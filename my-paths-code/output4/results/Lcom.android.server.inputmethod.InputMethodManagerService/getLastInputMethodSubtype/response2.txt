Based on the provided information, we can analyze the access control level of the `getLastInputMethodSubtype` method.

The `getLastInputMethodSubtype` method interacts with sensitive data, such as input method settings and subtype history, which are also accessed by the similar APIs (`getEnabledInputMethodSubtypeList` and `getInputMethodList`). These similar APIs have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating that they require system or signature-level permission to access the sensitive data.

The sink code in the `getLastInputMethodSubtype` method also suggests that it is accessing sensitive data, such as the enabled input methods and subtype list, and loading the input method and subtype history. This is similar to the operations performed by the similar APIs.

Considering the similarity between the `getLastInputMethodSubtype` method and the similar APIs, and the access control levels of these APIs, it is reasonable to conclude that the `getLastInputMethodSubtype` method should also have an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`.

Here is the final access control level in JSON format:

```json
{
  "access_control_level": "SYS_OR_SIG"
}
