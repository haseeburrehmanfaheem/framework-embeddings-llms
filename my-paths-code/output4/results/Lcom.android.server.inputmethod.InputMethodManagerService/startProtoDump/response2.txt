To determine the access control level for the `startProtoDump` method, we need to analyze its code and compare it with the provided similar API, `dumpSensorServiceStateProto`. 

1. **Analysis of `startProtoDump`**:
   - The method involves creating a `ProtoOutputStream`, writing data to it (including system time and input parameters), and then adding this output stream to a buffer via an `ImeTracing` instance.
   - It checks if the current thread is a system thread (`ActivityThread.isSystem()`) but does not use this information to restrict access or alter its behavior significantly regarding security or privacy.
   - The method handles input parameters (a byte array, an integer, and a string) and uses them in the proto dump process.

2. **Comparison with `dumpSensorServiceStateProto`**:
   - This API has been assigned an access control level of `NORMAL`.
   - It creates a `ProtoOutputStream`, dumps the state of a sensor service into it, and returns the output stream as a byte array.
   - The key similarity is the use of `ProtoOutputStream` for dumping data. However, `dumpSensorServiceStateProto` seems more focused on providing a state dump in response to a request, whereas `startProtoDump` appears to initiate a tracing or debugging process.

3. **Access Control Level Consideration**:
   - `NONE`: Typically applies to methods that do not access sensitive information or perform actions that could impact system security or user privacy.
   - `NORMAL`: Applies to methods that provide standard functionality without significant security or privacy implications but may still handle user data or system resources in a way that requires some level of trust.
   - `DANGEROUS`: Reserved for operations that can significantly impact the user's privacy or the system's security, such as accessing location data, contacts, or performing operations that could lead to financial loss.
   - `SYS_OR_SIG`: Applies to methods and operations that are either signature-protected (requiring a specific permission signature to use) or are only accessible by the system or applications with system-level permissions.

Given these considerations:
- The `startProtoDump` method involves handling input data and initiating a tracing process, which may include sensitive information but does not explicitly indicate dangerous operations like financial transactions, location tracking, etc.
- It uses system resources (like elapsed real time) and potentially handles user or system-specific data in the byte array and string parameters.
- The similarity with `dumpSensorServiceStateProto`, which is labeled as `NORMAL`, suggests that while there are differences, both methods are involved in dumping or tracing system/service state information.

**Conclusion**: Given the method's functionality, its handling of input parameters, and comparison with similar APIs like `dumpSensorServiceStateProto`, it seems reasonable to assign an access control level of `NORMAL` to `startProtoDump`. This is because while it does handle potentially sensitive data and performs a system-related operation, it does not appear to pose significant risks to user privacy or system security that would warrant a `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` classification.
