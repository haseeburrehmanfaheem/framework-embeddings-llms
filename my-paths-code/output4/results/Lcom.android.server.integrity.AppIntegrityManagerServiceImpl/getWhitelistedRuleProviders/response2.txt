To determine the access control level for the `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The method retrieves a string array from resources and converts it into a list of whitelisted rule providers. This operation involves accessing internal application resources but does not directly interact with sensitive user data or external systems that could pose a significant security risk.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code indicates the retrieval of a specific string array resource (`v2.getStringArray(17236075)`) and its conversion into a list. This action is primarily related to internal application configuration or settings, which typically does not require high-level access control.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**:
   - `getPersistentDataPackageName()`: This method has an access control level of `SYS_OR_SIG`, indicating it requires system or signature-level permission. It retrieves a string resource, similar to the operation in `getWhitelistedRuleProviders`. However, its higher access control might be due to the nature of persistent data packaging being more sensitive.
   - `getSensorPropertiesInternal(Ljava/lang/String;)`: With an access control level of `NORMAL`, this method returns a list of sensor properties based on an input string. It suggests that operations involving internal properties or configurations can be assigned a normal access control level if they do not directly impact system security or user privacy.

Given these points, the `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` method primarily deals with internal application resources and configuration settings. Its operation does not seem to pose significant risks related to user data privacy or system integrity that would necessitate `DANGEROUS` or `SYS_OR_SIG` access control levels. However, since it involves accessing specific application resources (though not directly interacting with sensitive data), assigning it an access control level of `NONE` might underestimate the need for some form of regulation.

Thus, considering its similarity in functionality to `getSensorPropertiesInternal`, which has a `NORMAL` access control level and acknowledging that it doesn't deal with highly sensitive information or system-critical operations, the most appropriate access control level for `getWhitelistedRuleProviders` seems to be `NORMAL`.
