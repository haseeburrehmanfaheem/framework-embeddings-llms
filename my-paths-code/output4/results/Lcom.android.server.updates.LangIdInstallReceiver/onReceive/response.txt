To identify potential sinks in the provided code snippet, let's analyze it step by step according to the given rules:

1. **Method Invocations**: The method `start()` is invoked on the object `v1` of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`. However, this invocation alone does not provide enough context regarding its sensitivity without knowing what `start()` does.

2. **Field Get Cases and Set Cases**: There are no explicit field get or set cases in this snippet that directly relate to the API name or parameters.

3. **Creation of New Objects**: An object `v1` of type `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` is created with parameters `(p0, p2, p1)`. This object creation follows one of the positive rules because it involves data flow from the API parameters (`p2`, `p1`) and potentially `p0`.

Given these observations, we can identify a potential sink in the creation and usage of the `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` object, as it directly involves the processing of input parameters.

Here is the JSON representation of the identified sinks:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v1 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
            "v1.start();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This sink involves the creation of a new object with input parameters and the subsequent invocation of a method on that object, which could potentially lead to sensitive operations based on how `start()` is implemented. Since there's only one identified set of instructions contributing to a potential sink in this snippet, it stands alone in the "Sinks" array.
