To determine the access control level for the `onReceive` method, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Code Snippet Analysis**: The `onReceive` method creates an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`, passing `p0`, `p2`, and `p1` to its constructor, and then calls the `start()` method on this instance. This suggests that the method is involved in starting some form of asynchronous or threaded operation related to receiving intents.

2. **Sink Code Analysis**: The sink code snippet provided is essentially the same as the code within the `onReceive` method itself, indicating that the critical operation (starting `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`) is directly tied to the intent reception handling logic.

3. **Similar APIs Analysis**: There's a similar API with a 100% similarity score, which has an access control level of `NONE`. This similar API performs the same operations as the `onReceive` method in question: creating an instance of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` and calling its `start()` method.

Given this analysis:

- The operation performed by `onReceive` does not seem to directly interact with sensitive user data, perform dangerous operations (like sending SMS, making calls, or accessing fine location), or require special system permissions that would elevate it beyond normal app capabilities.
- The similarity with another API that has an access control level of `NONE` suggests a consistent handling for such intent reception and processing mechanisms.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the access control level for the `onReceive` method should be assigned as `NONE`, reflecting its role in standard application operations without direct implications on user privacy or system security that would require higher access controls.
