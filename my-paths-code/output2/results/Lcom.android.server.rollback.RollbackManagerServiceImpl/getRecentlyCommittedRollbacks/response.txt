To identify potential sinks in the provided code, we'll analyze each method invocation, field access, and object creation based on the given positive and negative rules.

Starting with the `getRecentlyCommittedRollbacks()` method:
- It creates a new instance of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8`, which has naming similarity with the class but not directly with the API name. However, its creation involves data flow from the API parameters indirectly through `p0`.
- The `enforceManageRollbacks` and `assertNotInWorkerThread` methods are called, but these seem to be auxiliary operations (input validation/sanity checks) and thus follow negative rules.
- The method invokes `awaitResult(v2)`, which takes an input parameter from the API. The return value of `awaitResult` is directly returned by the API.

For the `assertNotInWorkerThread()` method:
- It accesses a field (`getHandler()`) but this seems to be an auxiliary operation (obtaining an instance of a class or accessing context objects), thus following negative rules.
- It invokes `isCurrentThread()` and performs a check, which is more related to logging/input validation rather than a sink.

For the `awaitResult(Supplier p1)` method:
- It calls `assertNotInWorkerThread()`, which we've identified as an auxiliary operation or input validation.
- It creates a new `CompletableFuture` with the supplier and executor, involving data flow from the API parameters indirectly through `p1`.
- The return value of `v2.get()` is directly returned by the API.

Given these observations:
- The creation of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8` and its use in `awaitResult(v2)` could potentially be a sink due to data flow involvement.
- The `awaitResult(Supplier p1)` method's invocation with the supplier as an argument and its return value being returned by the API indicates it could be part of a sink.

However, considering the negative rules (auxiliary operations, logging/input validation), most of the methods seem to fall into these categories rather than direct sinks. 

The potential set of sinks based on data flow and method invocations would involve:
- The creation and use of `RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8` in `awaitResult(v2)`.
- The invocation of `awaitResult(Supplier p1)` with its return value being directly returned by the API.

Here's how you might represent this in JSON format, keeping in mind that these are not as sensitive or direct as other potential sinks might be due to the nature of the provided code:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8 v2 = new RollbackManagerServiceImpl$$ExternalSyntheticLambda8(p0);",
            "Object v4 = p0.awaitResult(v2);",
            "return v4;"
        ],
        [
            "CompletableFuture v2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(p1, this.mExecutor);",
            "Object v3 = v2.get();",
            "return v3;"
        ]
    ]
}
```
