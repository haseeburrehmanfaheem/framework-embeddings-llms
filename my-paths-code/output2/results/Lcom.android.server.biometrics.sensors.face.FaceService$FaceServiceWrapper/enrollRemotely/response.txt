Since the provided code is incomplete and does not contain any instructions that contribute to a sink according to the positive rules, there are no sinks identified.

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

However, if we consider the method `enrollRemotely` itself as a potential sink due to its naming similarity with an API name (not explicitly provided in this context), and considering it takes input parameters that could potentially be used in a data flow leading to a sensitive operation, further analysis would be required on the complete code of `enrollRemotely`. But based solely on the information given:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "public long enrollRemotely(int p1, IBinder p2, byte[] p3, IFaceServiceReceiver p4, String p5, [I p6){",
      "return -1;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This would be speculative without more context on how `enrollRemotely` is used and what its return value signifies in terms of security or access control.
