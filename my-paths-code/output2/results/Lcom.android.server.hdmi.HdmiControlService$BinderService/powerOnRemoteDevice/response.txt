To analyze the provided Java code for potential sinks that require access control, let's break down each step in the execution to understand how data flows through the API and how internal fields are accessed or updated.

1. **Method Invocations:**
   - `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);` 
     - This method invocation has a naming similarity with no direct relation to "powerOnRemoteDevice" but is an initialization call, which may not directly contribute to a sink but could be part of the setup for further operations.
   - `this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);`
     - This invocation takes an object created with API parameters (`v1`), suggesting it might follow one of the positive rules due to its creation being influenced by the API's input parameters.

2. **Object Creation:**
   - `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$10(p0,p1,p2);`
     - This object is created with data flow from the API parameters (`p0`, `p1`, `p2`), directly linking its creation to the input of the API, suggesting it follows one of the positive rules.

3. **Field Access and Updates:**
   - Within the depth 2 method `initBinderCall()`, we have:
     - `p0.enforceAccessPermission();`
       - This call could imply access control but does not directly use or return any values related to the API parameters (`p1` and `p2`) of `powerOnRemoteDevice`. It seems more like an auxiliary operation for security purposes.
     - `p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();`
       - Similar to the previous call, it seems to be an auxiliary operation setting up something based on the calling UID but does not directly follow any of the positive rules regarding data flow from API parameters.

Given these observations, we can identify potential sinks as follows:

- The creation and use of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$10 v1` seem closely related to the API's operation, potentially forming a sink due to its direct influence by the API's input parameters.
- However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the most critical operations (from a data flow perspective) are within the nested method calls. The `initBinderCall` method performs security-related checks but doesn't directly contribute to a "sink" in terms of processing or returning sensitive data based on the API's input parameters.

Therefore, considering the provided code and focusing on instructions that collectively contribute to a sink with a clear data flow link between them:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "HdmiControlService$BinderService$10 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$10(p0,p1,p2);",
      "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This JSON represents the coherent set of instructions where `v1` is created using API parameters and then used in a method invocation, showing a direct data flow link between these operations. Other parts of the code seem to be more about setup or auxiliary operations rather than directly contributing to sinks related to the API's input parameters.
