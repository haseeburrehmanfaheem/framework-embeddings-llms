Based on the provided code, here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "p1.initBinderCall();",
            "p0.enforceAccessPermission();",
            "p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The `initBinderCall` method is invoked in the API with a naming similarity to binder-related operations, which could imply access control.
- Within `initBinderCall`, both `enforceAccessPermission` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid` are called. These methods directly relate to access control and user identification, indicating potential sinks due to their influence on system security and data privacy.
- The creation of a new object (`HdmiControlService$BinderService$17`) with parameters from the API input is noted but does not directly contribute to identified sinks in this context, as its primary role seems to be initiating a service thread rather than directly influencing access control or sensitive data handling.
