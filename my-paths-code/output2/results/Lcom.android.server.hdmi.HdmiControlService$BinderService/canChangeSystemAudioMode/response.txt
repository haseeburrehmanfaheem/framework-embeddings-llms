After analyzing the provided code paths for the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);",
      "p1.initBinderCall();",
      "p0.enforceAccessPermission();",
      "p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();"
    ],
    [
      "HdmiCecLocalDevice v1 = this.mHdmiCecNetwork.getLocalDevice(0);",
      "Object v1 = this.mLocalDevices.get(p1);"
    ],
    [
      "HdmiDeviceInfo v1 = p0.getSafeAvrDeviceInfo();",
      "HdmiCecNetwork v1 = HdmiCecLocalDevice.mService.getHdmiCecNetwork();",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo v2 = v1.getSafeCecDeviceInfo(5);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the identified sinks:

1. The first sink set includes the invocation of `initBinderCall`, which calls `enforceAccessPermission` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid`. These methods have high relevance to access control, as they enforce permissions and update the work source UID.
2. The second sink set includes the retrieval of a local device using `getLocalDevice` and assignment to `v1`. Although this seems like an auxiliary operation, it's part of the data flow that leads to the `hasSystemAudioDevice` method call, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the system audio device is present.
3. The third sink set includes the retrieval of safe AVR device information using `getSafeAvrDeviceInfo`, which involves getting the HDMI Cec network and then retrieving the safe Cec device info. This data flow contributes to the overall decision-making process in the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` API.

Note that I've ranked these sinks based on their relevance to access control, with the first set being the most sensitive as it directly enforces permissions and updates the work source UID. The second and third sets are less sensitive but still contribute to the data flow that leads to the final decision in the `canChangeSystemAudioMode` API.
