To analyze the provided code and identify potential sinks, we need to break down each step in the execution flow of the API `setArcMode`. 

1. The API `setArcMode` starts by calling `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0)`, which is a method invocation with naming similarity to the class name but not directly related to the API name `setArcMode`. However, it sets up a binder call, indicating potential access control.

2. The creation of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14` object `v1` involves data flow from the API parameter `p0`, suggesting this could be part of a sink if `v1` is used in a sensitive operation.

3. The method `runOnServiceThread(v1)` executes `v1` on a service thread, potentially leading to access control or permission checks within its execution path.

Following the depth levels provided:
- At depth 0, `setArcMode` invokes `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall`, which indirectly leads to executing operations on the service thread.
- At depth 1, `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall` calls `initBinderCall`, setting up binder call operations.
- At depth 2, `initBinderCall` enforces access permission and sets work source UID to calling UID, directly involving access control.

Given these observations:
- The creation of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14 v1` could be considered part of a sink due to its data flow from the API parameter.
- The method invocations leading to `initBinderCall` are crucial as they enforce access permission and set work source UID, directly impacting access control.

Thus, we identify one coherent set of instructions that form a potential sink related to access control:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);",
        "p1.initBinderCall();",
        "p0.enforceAccessPermission();",
        "p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();"
    ],
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$14 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$14(p0);",
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);"
    ]
]
}
```

However, considering the sensitivity and direct impact on access control, we should prioritize operations directly enforcing permissions and UID settings. Therefore, the corrected ranking with the most sensitive operation first is:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall(this.this$0);",
        "p1.initBinderCall();",
        "p0.enforceAccessPermission();",
        "p0.setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid();"
    ],
    [
        "HdmiControlService$BinderService$14 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$14(p0);",
        "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);"
    ]
]
}
```
