Based on the provided API code, we can analyze it to identify potential sinks. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. The `sendStandby` method creates a new object `HdmiControlService$BinderService$16` with input parameters `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`. This object creation follows one of the positive rules, as it is created with data flow from the API parameters.

2. The `runOnServiceThread` method is invoked on `this.this$0`, passing the newly created object `v1` as an argument. Although this invocation does not directly follow any of the positive rules, its indirect influence through the creation and usage of `v1` links it to the potential sink.

3. The `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall` method is invoked on `HdmiControlService.-$$Nest$minitBinderCall`, which in turn calls `initBinderCall`. This invocation has naming similarity with the inner methods and processes the input parameters indirectly through the object creation.

4. In the `initBinderCall` method, `enforceAccessPermission` is called on `p0`, followed by `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid`. These invocations are relevant as they involve access control (permission enforcement) and modification of a field with data flow from the API parameters.

However, upon closer inspection:

- The creation of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$16` and its usage in `runOnServiceThread` can be considered a potential sink due to object creation with data flow from API parameters.
- The method invocations within `-$$Nest$minitBinderCall` and `initBinderCall`, specifically `enforceAccessPermission` and `setWorkSourceUidToCallingUid`, are indeed relevant. Yet, these seem more aligned with auxiliary operations (access control and obtaining an instance of a class) rather than direct data propagation or sinks.

Given the analysis, we identify one primary potential sink related to object creation and its usage:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "HdmiControlService$BinderService$16 v1 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$16(p0,p2,p1);",
      "this.this$0.runOnServiceThread(v1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This sink involves object creation with data flow from API parameters and its subsequent usage, following the positive rules for identifying potential sinks. The other method invocations seem to relate more closely to auxiliary operations or access control rather than direct data propagation indicating a sink.
