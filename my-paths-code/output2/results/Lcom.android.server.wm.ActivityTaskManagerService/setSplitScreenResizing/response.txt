To analyze the provided paths for potential sinks in the `setSplitScreenResizing` API, we'll follow the guidelines that include identifying method invocations, field accesses and updates, object creation, and data flows. We're interested in instructions that contribute to a sink by following at least one of the positive rules (naming similarity, input parameters as arguments, return value usage) while excluding generic utility methods, logging, and auxiliary operations.

Given the depth levels and code snippets for paths 1 through 3, let's break down each relevant step:

1. **Method Invocations:**
   - `enforceTaskPermission("setSplitScreenResizing()")`: This method invocation has naming similarity with the API name but is primarily used for permission checking, which might not directly contribute to a sensitive data flow in terms of sinks related to the API's primary functionality.
   - `boostPriorityForLockedSection()` and `resetPriorityAfterLockedSection()`: These are auxiliary operations related to thread priority boosting and resetting. They do not directly contribute to the primary data flow or potential sinks related to setting split-screen resizing.

2. **Field Accesses and Updates:**
   - `this.mTaskSupervisor.setSplitScreenResizing(p1)`: This line updates a field (`mDockedRootTaskResizing`) with the API parameter (`p1`), showing direct modification based on the input.
   - `this.mWindowManager.setDockedRootTaskResizing(p1)`: Similar to the above, it modifies a field (indirectly through another method call) using the API's input parameter.

3. **Object Creation and Data Flows:**
   - There are no direct object creations in the provided paths that are directly influenced by the API parameters and contribute to potential sinks.

Given these observations, we can identify the following potential sink set:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "this.mTaskSupervisor.setSplitScreenResizing(p1);",
      "this.mDockedRootTaskResizing = p1;",
      "this.mWindowManager.setDockedRootTaskResizing(p1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This set represents the instructions that directly contribute to setting the split-screen resizing state, with a clear data flow link from the API's input parameter `p1` through method invocations and field updates. The other methods and operations in the paths provided do not directly contribute to potential sinks according to the given positive rules and are considered auxiliary or logging operations.
