Based on the provided code snippet for the API `onReceive`, we need to analyze it according to the given rules for identifying potential sinks.

The code is as follows:
```java
public void onReceive(Context p1, Intent p2){
    ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v0 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);
    v0.start();
    return;
}
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Method Invocation**: The `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` constructor is invoked with parameters `p0`, `p2`, and `p1`. This method invocation follows one of the positive rules because it takes input parameters as arguments (`p2` and `p1`), which are directly related to the API's parameters.

2. **Object Creation**: The creation of a new object `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1` has a naming similarity with parts of the API context (considering `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver`) and is created using data flow from the API parameters (`p0`, `p2`, and `p1`). This follows one of the positive rules for object creation.

3. **Method Invocation on Object**: The `start()` method is invoked on the newly created object `v0`. While this does not directly follow any of the specific positive rules due to lack of information about what `start()` does, it's part of the data flow from the API parameters through the creation and usage of `ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1`.

Given these points, we can identify a potential sink in the code. The relevant instructions that collectively contribute to this sink are:
- The object creation with API parameters.
- The method invocation on this object.

Therefore, the JSON representation of the identified sink(s) is:
```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1 v0 = new ConfigUpdateInstallReceiver$1(p0,p2,p1);",
            "v0.start();"
        ]
    ]
}
```
This represents a coherent set of instructions with a clear data flow link between them, where the creation of `v0` directly influences the invocation of `start()` on it.
