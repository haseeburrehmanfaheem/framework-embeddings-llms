Based on the provided code, here's the analysis:

The `removeImeSurface` method contains a single potential sink. The relevant instructions are:

* `Message v2 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1060);`
* `v2.sendToTarget();`

These instructions are related because the `obtainMessage` method creates a new message object, and the `sendToTarget` method sends that message to its target handler.

Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "Message v2 = this.mHandler.obtainMessage(1060);",
            "v2.sendToTarget();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Note that this sink does not follow any of the positive rules directly, as it does not have naming similarity with the API name, nor does it take input parameters or return a value. However, since `obtainMessage` and `sendToTarget` are method invocations on an object (`mHandler`) that could potentially interact with sensitive data or APIs, this could be considered a potential sink in certain contexts.

However, according to the provided rules, generic utility methods like `obtainMessage` should not be considered as sinks. Also, since there's no direct data flow from API parameters to the message being sent, and it doesn't seem to access any sensitive fields directly or indirectly that are returned by the API, this might not qualify as a sink under the provided criteria.

So, considering these factors and the rules given:

```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates there are no sinks in the given code snippet based on the provided rules.
