To analyze the provided code paths for potential sinks that require access control, let's break down each step according to the given positive and negative rules.

### Path Analysis

Both paths provided are identical, which simplifies our analysis since we only need to examine one set of methods and their interactions.

1. **`clearGrantedUriPermissions(String p1, int p2)`**:
   - This method invokes `removeUriPermissionsForPackageLocked(p1, p2, 1, 1)`.
   - The parameters `p1` and `p2` are passed directly to the invoked method, indicating a potential data flow that could contribute to a sink.

2. **`removeUriPermissionsForPackageLocked(String p1, int p2, boolean p3, boolean p4)`**:
   - This method calls `schedulePersistUriGrants()`.
   - Although `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` are not directly used in the creation or modification of objects within this method that could be considered sinks based on the positive rules provided, it's essential to note that the method does access `this.mGrantedUriPermissions.size()`.
   - The method invocation of `schedulePersistUriGrants()` does not directly pass any parameters from the API call, but it is part of the data flow initiated by `clearGrantedUriPermissions`.

3. **`schedulePersistUriGrants()`**:
   - This method involves messaging operations (`hasMessages`, `obtainMessage`, and `sendMessageDelayed`) on an object referred to as `this.mH`.
   - While these operations are auxiliary in nature (dealing with message handling), they do not directly contribute to creating or modifying objects that would be considered sinks based on the provided rules.

### Identifying Sinks

Based on the positive rules for identifying potential sinks:
- Method invocations, field accesses, and object creations that have naming similarity with the API name or involve API parameters are of interest.
- For `clearGrantedUriPermissions`, the method invocation `removeUriPermissionsForPackageLocked` involves the input parameters (`p1` and `p2`) and has a naming similarity with the concept of URI permissions, which could imply a sensitive operation related to access control.

Given these observations, we can identify a potential sink set that involves the initial API call and its immediate method invocation because they directly process the API's input parameters and are related to URI permission management.

### JSON Output

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "public void clearGrantedUriPermissions(String p1, int p2){",
      "p0.removeUriPermissionsForPackageLocked(p1, p2, 1, 1);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This output highlights the primary method invocation chain that directly relates to the API's purpose and involves processing its input parameters. The `schedulePersistUriGrants` method, while part of the execution flow, does not directly contribute to a sink based on the provided positive rules, as it does not create objects with naming similarity or involve direct data flows from the API parameters in a way that suggests access control relevance.
