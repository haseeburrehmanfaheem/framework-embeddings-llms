After analyzing the code for the `getGrantedUriPermissions` API with depth 0, I have identified a potential set of sinks. Here is the information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ArrayList v1 = new ArrayList();",
            "ParceledListSlice v3 = new ParceledListSlice(v1);",
            "return v3;"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This sink set follows the positive rule of creating a new object (`ParceledListSlice`) with dataflow from the API parameters indirectly, as `v1` is used to create `v3`. Although there are no direct method invocations or field accesses that process the input parameters, the creation and return of `v3` can be considered a potential sink. Note that this analysis might need further context about how `ParceledListSlice` and its contents are used elsewhere in the system to fully understand its sensitivity.
