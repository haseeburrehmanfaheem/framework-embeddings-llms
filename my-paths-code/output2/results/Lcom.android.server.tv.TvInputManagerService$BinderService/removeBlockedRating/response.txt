Based on the provided code, I will analyze each step to identify potential sinks. 

The API `removeBlockedRating` takes two parameters: `p1` (a string) and `p2` (an integer). It first calls `ensureParentalControlsPermission`, which does not seem to have any effect as it simply returns without doing anything.

Next, the API gets the calling PID and UID using `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()`. However, these values are used in logging or auxiliary operations, so they do not contribute to a sink according to the negative rules.

The API then calls `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId` with the calling PID, UID, user ID (`p2`), and the string "removeBlockedRating". This method resolves the calling user ID and returns it. 

After resolving the user ID, the API gets a lock object using `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock`, which is an auxiliary operation.

The API then calls `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked` with the resolved user ID to get or create a `TvInputManagerService$UserState` object. 

Next, it gets a `PersistentDataStore` object from the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` object and removes a blocked rating using the `removeBlockedRating` method.

Now, let's analyze each step to identify potential sinks:

1. The call to `ensureParentalControlsPermission` does not seem to contribute to a sink as it simply returns without doing anything.
2. The calls to `Binder.getCallingPid()` and `Binder.getCallingUid()` do not contribute to a sink as they are used in logging or auxiliary operations.
3. The call to `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId` contributes to a sink because it processes the input parameters (`p2`) and its return value is used later in the API.
4. The call to `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$fgetmLock` does not contribute to a sink as it is an auxiliary operation.
5. The call to `TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked` contributes to a sink because it processes the input parameter (the resolved user ID) and its return value is used later in the API.
6. The creation of a `TvContentRating` object using `TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(p1)` contributes to a sink because it has naming similarity with the API name (`removeBlockedRating`) and is created with data flow from the API parameter (`p1`).
7. The call to `v8.removeBlockedRating(v9)` contributes to a sink because it processes the input parameter (the `TvContentRating` object) and its return value is not used, but the method has naming similarity with the API name.

Here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "int v4 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mresolveCallingUserId(this.this$0, v2, v3, p2, \"removeBlockedRating\");",
            "TvInputManagerService$UserState v7 = TvInputManagerService.-$$Nest$mgetOrCreateUserStateLocked(this.this$0, v4);",
            "PersistentDataStore v8 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.-$$Nest$fgetpersistentDataStore(v7);",
            "TvContentRating v9 = TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(p1);",
            "v8.removeBlockedRating(v9);"
        ]
    ]
}
```
