Here are the identified sinks for the `cancelRequest` API:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "SyncManager var4 = getSyncManager();",
        "var4.removePeriodicSync(var29, var18, var43);",
        "var4.cancelScheduledSyncOperation(var29, var18);"
    ],
    [
        "Bundle var50 = new Bundle();",
        "PersistableBundle var54 = getPersistableBundle(syncExtras);",
        "var50.putAll(var54);"
    ]
]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind identifying these sinks:

1.  The first set of instructions (`SyncManager` removal and cancellation) directly relate to the `cancelRequest` API, as they are modifying sync operations based on the input parameters (`var29`, `var18`, and `var43`). This is a clear case of a sink, where the output of one instruction influences the next.

2.  The second set of instructions (creation of a new `Bundle`) is also related to the API's functionality. Although it may not directly modify external state, the created bundle (`var50`) contains sensitive information from `syncExtras` and could potentially be used in another sink or have its contents leaked. However, without further context on how this bundle is used, we err on the side of caution and consider it a potential sink.

These sinks follow at least one of the positive rules: either having naming similarity with the API (`SyncManager`) or being created/modified with data flow from the API parameters.
