Here is the JSON output of potential sinks for the getBaseDisplaySize API:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var14 = var8.mBaseDisplayWidth;",
      "param3.x = var14;",
      "int var15 = var8.mBaseDisplayHeight;",
      "param3.y = var15;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The sink identified here is related to the access of `mBaseDisplayWidth` and `mBaseDisplayHeight` fields in the `DisplayContent` object. These field accesses follow the positive rule that they have naming similarity with the API name (`getBaseDisplaySize`). The accessed fields are also used to update the `x` and `y` coordinates of the `param3` object, which is likely returned by the API.

The code instructions listed in this sink array show a clear dataflow link between them. The values obtained from `mBaseDisplayWidth` and `mBaseDisplayHeight` field accesses directly influence the values assigned to `param3.x` and `param3.y`.
