Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "List var11 = queryIntentActivitiesInternal(param2,param3,param4,param5);",
        "int var7 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
        "List var11 = queryIntentActivitiesInternal(param2,param3,param4,var7,param5,0,1);"
    ],
    [
        "ResolveInfo var333 = new ResolveInfo();",
        "var333.activityInfo = var300;",
        "boolean var336 = var297.add(var333);"
    ],
    [
        "ResolveInfo var52 = new ResolveInfo();",
        "var52.auxiliaryInfo = var59;",
        "IntentFilter var68 = new IntentFilter();",
        "var52.filter = var68;"
    ]
]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

1. The first sink is related to the internal method `queryIntentActivitiesInternal`, which is called twice with different parameters. This method seems to retrieve information about intent activities, and its output might be sensitive.
2. The second sink involves creating a new `ResolveInfo` object (`var333`) and adding it to a list (`var297`). This could potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive information about resolved intents.
3. The third sink is similar to the second one but creates another `ResolveInfo` object (`var52`) and sets its auxiliary info and filter properties.

Please note that these sinks are identified based on the provided code snippet, which might not represent the entire method or class. Further analysis of the surrounding code may be necessary to confirm the sensitivity of these potential sinks.
