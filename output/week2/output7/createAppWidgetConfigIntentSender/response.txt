Based on the provided code for the `createAppWidgetConfigIntentSender` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Below is a JSON representation of these sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "PendingIntent var82 = PendingIntent.getActivityAsUser(var75,0,var61,1409286144,0,var77);",
      "IntentSender var84 = var82.getIntentSender();"
    ],
    [
      "AppWidgetServiceImpl$Widget var31 = lookupWidgetLocked(param3,var29,param2);",
      "AppWidgetServiceImpl$Provider var43 = var31.provider;",
      "var60 = param4 and -196;",
      "Intent var61 = new Intent();",
      "Intent var66 = var61.putExtra(appWidgetId,param3);",
      "AppWidgetProviderInfo var67 = var43.info;",
      "ComponentName var68 = var67.configure;",
      "Intent var70 = var61.setComponent(var68);",
      "Intent var72 = var61.setFlags(var60);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink involves the creation of a `PendingIntent` and its subsequent conversion to an `IntentSender`, which is returned by the API. This represents a potential security risk as it allows other components to send intents on behalf of the current app.

The second sink involves the creation of an `Intent` with sensitive information (e.g., `appWidgetId`, `ComponentName`) and its configuration using various methods (`setFlags`, `setComponent`). Although this intent is not directly returned by the API, it is used to create a `PendingIntent`, which is then converted to an `IntentSender`. This represents a potential security risk as it allows other components to access sensitive information.

Note that I have ranked these sinks based on their sensitivity, with the first sink being more sensitive as it involves the creation of an `IntentSender` that can be used by other components.
