After carefully analyzing the provided code, I identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "SharedUserSetting var11 = new SharedUserSetting();",
      "int var14 = acquireAndRegisterNewAppIdLPw(var11);",
      "var11.userId = var14;",
      "ArrayMap var49 = this.mSharedUsers;",
      "Object var51 = var49.put(param2,var11);"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayList var3 = this.mAppIds;",
      "int var5 = var3.size();",
      "int var6 = mFirstAvailableUid;",
      "ArrayList var17 = this.mAppIds;",
      "boolean var19 = var17.add(param2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind identifying these sinks:

1. The first set of instructions creates a new `SharedUserSetting` object (`var11`) and assigns it a user ID using the `acquireAndRegisterNewAppIdLPw` method. This new object is then added to the `mSharedUsers` map with the key `param2`. This data flow indicates that the created object's properties are influenced by the input parameters, making this set of instructions a potential sink.

2. The second set of instructions retrieves the size of the `mAppIds` list (`var5`) and assigns it to the variable `var6`, which is then used as an index for the same list. The value at that index is replaced with `param2`. Although this data flow does not directly create a new object, it modifies an existing collection based on input parameters.

Both sets of instructions follow the positive rules: they either have naming similarity with the API name (`SharedUserSetting`), take the input parameters as arguments (`var11.userId = var14;` and `boolean var19 = var17.add(param2);`), or create new objects/data flows influenced by the input parameters.
