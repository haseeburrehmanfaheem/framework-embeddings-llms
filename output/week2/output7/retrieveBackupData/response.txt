Here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var22 = var19.syncGetPrivilegedConfiguredNetwork(var20);",
      "[B var25 = var23.retrieveBackupDataFromConfigurations(var22);"
    ],
    [
      "FastXmlSerializer var7 = new FastXmlSerializer();",
      "ByteArrayOutputStream var9 = new ByteArrayOutputStream();",
      "var7.setOutput(var9, var13);",
      "XmlUtil.writeDocumentStart(var7, WifiBackupData);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink set is related to retrieving backup data from configurations. It involves the following steps:
   - `syncGetPrivilegedConfiguredNetwork` method is called with `var20` as an argument.
   - The result of this method call (`var22`) is used as an input parameter for the `retrieveBackupDataFromConfigurations` method.

2. The second sink set is related to creating a new XML serializer and output stream, which are then used to write the document start. This involves:
   - Creating a new instance of `FastXmlSerializer`.
   - Creating a new instance of `ByteArrayOutputStream`.
   - Setting the output of the XML serializer to the byte array output stream.
   - Writing the document start using `XmlUtil.writeDocumentStart`.

Both sink sets follow at least one positive rule. The first set has naming similarity with the API name (`retrieveBackupData`) and also processes the input parameters. The second set creates new objects (`FastXmlSerializer` and `ByteArrayOutputStream`) that are used to process sensitive data.

Note: I have ignored logging statements, auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining an instance of a class), and generic utility methods as they do not contribute to sinks according to the provided rules.
