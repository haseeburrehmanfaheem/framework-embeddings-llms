After analyzing the code, I have identified a potential sink in the API `getActiveSource`. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "HdmiCecLocalDevice$ActiveSource var47 = var46.mActiveSource;",
      "boolean var49 = var47.isValid();",
      "int var75 = var47.logicalAddress;",
      "int var76 = var47.physicalAddress;",
      "int var80 = var77.pathToPortId(var78);",
      "HdmiDeviceInfo var74 = new HdmiDeviceInfo();",
      "var74.setLogicalAddress(var81);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the explanation of why I identified this as a potential sink:

* The variable `var47` is assigned the value of `mActiveSource`, which has high naming similarity with the API name `getActiveSource`.
* The method `isValid()` is called on `var47`, which checks the validity of the active source. This suggests that the API is processing sensitive information.
* The variables `var75` and `var76` are assigned the values of `logicalAddress` and `physicalAddress` from `var47`. These addresses seem to be related to the HDMI device, which could be sensitive information.
* The method `pathToPortId()` is called on `var77` with the physical address as an argument. This suggests that the API is processing device-specific information.
* A new instance of `HdmiDeviceInfo` is created and assigned to `var74`. This object seems to represent a HDMI device, which could contain sensitive information.

Overall, this sink set suggests that the API `getActiveSource` is processing sensitive information related to the active HDMI source, including its logical and physical addresses.
