Here is the analysis of the provided Java code for potential sinks that require access control:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "SpellCheckerInfo var13 = var9.getCurrentSpellChecker();",
        "ServiceInfo var15 = var13.getServiceInfo();",
        "ApplicationInfo var16 = var15.applicationInfo;"
    ],
    [
        "ArrayList var9 = TextServicesManagerService$TextServicesData.access$1700(var6);",
        "int var11 = var9.size();",
        "SpellCheckerInfo var12 = new SpellCheckerInfo(var11);",
        "Object var14 = var9.toArray(var12);",
        "SpellCheckerInfo var15 = (SpellCheckerInfo) var14;"
    ]
]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink set involves the retrieval of sensitive information about the current spell checker, including its service info and application info. This data is accessed through a series of method calls that ultimately lead to the `getCurrentSpellChecker()` method.

2. The second sink set involves the creation of a new `SpellCheckerInfo` object and populating it with data from an `ArrayList`. The `toArray()` method is used to convert the list into an array, which is then cast to a `SpellCheckerInfo[]`.

Ranking:
The first sink set is more sensitive as it provides detailed information about the current spell checker's service and application. Therefore, it should be ranked higher than the second sink set.

Note that some variables are accessed multiple times in the code (e.g., `var6`, `var9`), but for clarity and brevity, only the most relevant accesses are included in the sink sets.
