Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserInfo var33 = userWithName(var21);", 
      "boolean var35 = var8.add(var33);"
    ],
    [
      "UserInfo var7 = new UserInfo();", 
      "var7.name = var10;", 
      // Note: Although not explicitly shown, the newly created UserInfo object is likely to be added to the ArrayList
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink array represents the creation of a `UserInfo` object (`var33`) and its addition to an `ArrayList` (`var8`). This satisfies the positive rule for object creation with data flow from API parameters (`var21`).

2. The second sink array represents the creation of another `UserInfo` object (`var7`) and setting its name field using the `getOwnerName()` method. Although not explicitly shown, it's likely that this newly created object is added to the same `ArrayList`, thus propagating sensitive information.

Ranking: I ranked the sinks with the most direct data flow from API parameters first (the first sink array). The second sink array, although also creating a `UserInfo` object, has less clear data flow and might be considered slightly less sensitive.
