Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `performDexOptSecondary`, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean var13 = performDexOpt(var10);",
      "var10 = new DexoptOptions();"
    ],
    [
      "PackageInfo var43 = var39.getPackageInfo(var13,0,var41);",
      "int var41 = var38.getOwnerUserId();",
      "IPackageManager var39 = this.mPackageManager;"
    ],
    [
      "boolean var66 = var62.removeUserPackage(var13,var64);",
      "var64 = var38.getOwnerUserId();",
      "PackageDexUsage var62 = this.mPackageDexUsage;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

These sinks are identified based on the rules provided:

1. Method invocations:
   - `performDexOpt` is invoked with `var10` as an argument, which has high naming similarity with `DexoptOptions`.
   - `getPackageInfo` is invoked with `var13`, `0`, and `var41` as arguments, where `var41` is the owner user ID.
   - `removeUserPackage` is invoked with `var13` and `var64` as arguments, where `var64` is the owner user ID.

2. Field get cases:
   - None identified based on the provided rules.

3. Field set cases:
   - None identified based on the provided rules.

4. Creation of new objects:
   - A new `DexoptOptions` object is created using the data flow from the API parameters.
   - A new `PackageInfo` object is not directly created, but it's returned by the `getPackageInfo` method invocation, which takes into account the owner user ID.

Note that some variables and methods are not included in the sinks identification as they do not meet the provided rules (e.g., logging statements, auxiliary operations).
