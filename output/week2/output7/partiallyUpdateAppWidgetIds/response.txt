Based on the provided code for the `partiallyUpdateAppWidgetIds` API, I've identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "RemoteViews var13 = param2.views;",
      "var13.mergeRemoteViews(param3);",
      "param2.views = var13;"
    ],
    [
      "AppWidgetServiceImpl$Host var9 = param2.host;",
      "IAppWidgetHost var15 = var14.callbacks;",
      "SomeArgs var19 = SomeArgs.obtain();",
      "var19.arg1 = var20;",
      "var19.arg2 = var22;",
      "Handler var31 = this.mCallbackHandler;",
      "Message var34 = var31.obtainMessage(1,var19);"
    ],
    [
      "RemoteViews var51 = getEffectiveViewsLocked();",
      "scheduleNotifyUpdateAppWidgetLocked(param2,var51);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

These sinks are identified based on the positive rules:

*   The first sink is related to updating `param2.views` with new remote views (`param3`). This update directly influences the state of the widget, making it a potential sink.
*   The second sink involves sending a message to a handler (`this.mCallbackHandler`) with sensitive data (e.g., host callbacks and app widget ID). This action could potentially expose or modify sensitive information.
*   The third sink is related to scheduling an update for the app widget using `scheduleNotifyUpdateAppWidgetLocked`. Although it doesn't directly involve modifying state, it's a critical operation that should be subject to access control.

Note that I've excluded generic utility methods (e.g., ` Binder.getCallingUid`, `UserHandle.getAppId`), logging statements, and auxiliary operations from the identified sinks, as per the negative rules.
