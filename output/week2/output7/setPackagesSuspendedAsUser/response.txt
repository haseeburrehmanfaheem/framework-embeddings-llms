Based on the provided Java code, here are the identified sinks that require access control in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean var66 = filterAppAccessLPr(var64,var10,param8);",
      "PackageSetting var64 = (PackageSetting) var63;",
      "Object var63 = var61.get(var31);",
      "ArrayMap var61 = var60.mPackages;"
    ],
    [
      "boolean var7 = filterAppAccessLPr(param2,param3,0,0,param4);"
    ],
    [
      "String var21 = param2.name;",
      "ArrayList var16 = new ArrayList();"
    ],
    [
      "ComponentName var16 = getDefaultHomeActivity(param3);",
      "String var18 = var16.getPackageName();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink is the most sensitive as it involves accessing a `PackageSetting` object, which contains sensitive package information, and calling the `filterAppAccessLPr` method with user ID (`var10`) and other parameters.
2. The second sink is less sensitive but still important as it calls the same `filterAppAccessLPr` method with different parameters, including `param2`, `param3`, and `param4`.
3. The third sink involves accessing an object's name property (`param2.name`) and creating a new `ArrayList`. While not directly related to access control, this sink might be relevant in certain contexts.
4. The fourth sink is relatively less sensitive as it involves getting the package name of a default home activity.

Please note that this ranking may vary depending on the specific requirements and context of your application.
