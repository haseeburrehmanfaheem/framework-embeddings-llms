Based on the provided code, I have identified two potential sinks. Here is the JSON output:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "RemoteViews var34 = AppWidgetServiceImpl.cloneIfLocalBinder(var32);",
      "return var34;" // implicit return statement
    ],
    [
      "AppWidgetServiceImpl$SecurityPolicy var14 = this.mSecurityPolicy;",
      "int var13 = var12.appWidgetId;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

However, upon further analysis, I realize that the second sink does not meet any of the positive rules. `var14` is not used in a way that contributes to a sink (it's just an assignment), and `var13` is not returned or used with other sinks.

Here is the corrected JSON output:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "RemoteViews var34 = AppWidgetServiceImpl.cloneIfLocalBinder(var32);",
      "return var34;" // implicit return statement
    ]
  ]
}
```

This sink follows the positive rule of creating a new object with dataflow from API parameters (`var32` is obtained from `getEffectiveViewsLocked()`, which takes `param3`, `var28`, and `param2` as input). The created object `var34` is also returned by the API.
