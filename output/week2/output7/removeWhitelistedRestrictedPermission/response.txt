Based on the provided Java code, I've identified potential sinks that require access control. Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var12 = getWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions(param2,param4,param5);",
      "Object var35 = var33.get(param2);",
      "PackageSetting var36 = (PackageSetting) var35;",
      "String var46 = var36.installerPackageName;"
    ],
    [
      "int var52 = Binder.getCallingUid();"
    ],
    [
      "boolean var54 = UserHandle.isSameApp(var50,var52);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind each sink:

1. The first sink set includes instructions that contribute to retrieving a list of whitelisted restricted permissions for a specific package (`param2`). This data is sensitive and requires access control.
	* `getWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions` method invocation has naming similarity with the API name `removeWhitelistedRestrictedPermission`.
	* The returned list is used to retrieve a `PackageSetting` object, which contains sensitive information about the package.
2. The second sink includes an instruction that retrieves the calling user ID using the `Binder.getCallingUid()` method.
	* This instruction has high naming similarity with the API name and returns a value that could be used for access control decisions.
3. The third sink includes an instruction that checks whether the calling app is the same as the package's installer app using the `UserHandle.isSameApp` method.
	* This instruction uses sensitive information about the package (its installer app ID) and could influence access control decisions.

Note that these sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive, with the first sink being the most critical.
