Based on the provided Java code, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "AccountsDb var9 = var8.accountsDb;",
      "long var11 = var9.findSharedAccountId(param2);",
      "AccountsDb var12 = var8.accountsDb;",
      "boolean var14 = var12.deleteSharedAccount(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "AccountsDb var43 = param2.accountsDb;",
      "var43.beginTransaction();",
      "long var48 = var46.findDeAccountId(param3);",
      "boolean var56 = var54.deleteDeAccount(var48);",
      "long var67 = var65.findCeAccountId(param3);",
      "boolean var71 = var69.deleteCeAccount(var67);"
    ],
    [
      "HashMap var4 = param2.accountCache;",
      "String var5 = param3.type;",
      "Object var7 = var4.get(var5);",
      "ArrayList var10 = new ArrayList();",
      "int var28 = var10.size();",
      "Account var32 = (Account) var31;"
    ],
    [
      "Map var48 = AccountManagerService$UserAccounts.access$1100(param2);",
      "Object var50 = var48.remove(param3);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

These sinks involve database operations, account cache modifications, and removal of accounts. They require access control to prevent unauthorized data modification or deletion.

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink array is the most sensitive as it involves deletion of shared accounts.
2. The second sink array is also highly sensitive as it involves transactional database operations.
3. The third sink array is moderately sensitive as it involves modifications to the account cache.
4. The fourth sink array is less sensitive as it only involves removal of an entry from a map.

Note that the ranking may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements of the system.
