Based on the provided code, I've identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. Here are the results in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "SparseArray var4 = this.mCache;",
      "Object var6 = var4.get(param2);",
      "ArrayMap var7 = (ArrayMap) var6;",
      "ArrayMap var9 = new ArrayMap();",
      "SparseArray var11 = this.mCache;",
      "var11.put(param2, var9);"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayMap var28 = findOrCreateCacheLocked(param5, var23);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink involves the `mCache` field being accessed and modified with a new `ArrayMap` instance. The instructions are related to each other as they form a sequence of operations on the cache data structure.

The second sink is an invocation of the `findOrCreateCacheLocked` method, which has naming similarity with the API name `putCache`. This method also processes the input parameter `param5`, which may contribute to the sensitivity of this sink.
