Based on the provided Java code, I've identified potential sinks that require access control. Here's a JSON representation of the sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Vpn var15 = (Vpn) var14;",
      "boolean var17 = var15.setAlwaysOnPackage(param3,param4,param5);",
      "boolean var7 = setAlwaysOnPackageInternal(param2,param3,param4);"
    ],
    [
      "Notification$Builder var40 = new Notification$Builder();",
      "Context var41 = this.mContext;",
      "String var42 = VPN;",
      "Notification$Builder var46 = var40.setSmallIcon(17303774);",
      "Context var47 = this.mContext;",
      "String var50 = var47.getString(17041215);",
      "Notification$Builder var52 = var46.setContentTitle(var50);",
      "Context var53 = this.mContext;",
      "String var56 = var53.getString(17041212);",
      "Notification$Builder var58 = var52.setContentText(var56);",
      "Notification$Builder var60 = var58.setContentIntent(var39);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink set (`Vpn var15 = (Vpn) var14;`, etc.) is related to setting up a VPN connection and has direct access to internal state and configuration. This sink set is ranked as the most sensitive.
2. The second sink set (`Notification$Builder var40 = new Notification$Builder();`, etc.) is related to creating a notification and has access to user-facing information and system resources. While this sink set is still significant, it's ranked lower than the first one due to its relatively less critical nature.

These sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

* The `Vpn var15 = (Vpn) var14;` instruction follows rule 1 (method invocation with naming similarity and input parameters).
* The `Notification$Builder var40 = new Notification$Builder();` instruction follows rule 4 (object creation with data flow from API parameters).

No negative rules apply to these sinks.
