Here is the JSON output:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var7.addHistoricalOps(param2);",
      "LinkedList var9 = this.mPendingWrites;",
      "boolean var11 = var9.offerFirst(param2);",
      "persistPendingHistory(var12);",
      "HistoricalRegistry$Persistence var31 = this.mPersistence;",
      "var31.persistHistoricalOpsDLocked(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "AtomicDirectory var3 = sHistoricalAppOpsDir;",
      "File var5 = var3.startWrite();",
      "handlePersistHistoricalOpsRecursiveDLocked(var5,var8,param2,var10,0);",
      "AtomicDirectory var13 = sHistoricalAppOpsDir;",
      "var13.finishWrite();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this output:

The first sink set involves adding historical operations to the registry and persisting them to disk. The methods `addHistoricalOps`, `offerFirst`, `persistPendingHistory`, and `persistHistoricalOpsDLocked` all contribute to this sink, as they process the input parameter `param2` and store it in the registry or on disk.

The second sink set involves writing data to a file using an `AtomicDirectory`. The methods `startWrite`, `handlePersistHistoricalOpsRecursiveDLocked`, and `finishWrite` all contribute to this sink, as they create a file, write data to it recursively, and then finish the write operation.

Note that I've ignored the other code in the method that doesn't contribute to these two sinks, such as logging statements, checks for persistence initialization, and removal of messages from a handler.
