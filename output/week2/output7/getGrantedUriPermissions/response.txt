Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "SparseArray var15 = this.mGrantedUriPermissions;",
      "Object var17 = var15.valueAt(var45);",
      "ArrayMap var18 = (ArrayMap) var17;",
      "Object var22 = var18.valueAt(var40);",
      "UriPermission var23 = (UriPermission) var22;",
      "String var24 = var23.targetPkg;",
      "boolean var26 = equals(var24);"
    ],
    [
      "SparseArray var15 = this.mGrantedUriPermissions;",
      "Object var17 = var15.valueAt(var45);",
      "ArrayMap var18 = (ArrayMap) var17;",
      "Object var22 = var18.valueAt(var40);",
      "UriPermission var23 = (UriPermission) var22;",
      "int var29 = var23.targetUserId;",
      "int var30 = var23.persistedModeFlags;",
      "GrantedUriPermission var32 = var23.buildGrantedUriPermission();"
    ],
    [
      "GrantedUriPermission var2 = new GrantedUriPermission();",
      "GrantUri var3 = this.uri;",
      "Uri var4 = var3.uri;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive. The first sink is related to accessing and processing the `targetPkg` field of a `UriPermission` object, which could potentially reveal sensitive information about the package. The second sink is related to building a `GrantedUriPermission` object using the `buildGrantedUriPermission()` method of a `UriPermission` object, which could potentially create a new permission with sensitive information. The third sink is related to creating a new `GrantedUriPermission` object and accessing its fields, which could potentially reveal sensitive information about the URI.

Note that these sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

*   Method invocation: `equals(var24)`, `buildGrantedUriPermission()`
*   Field access: `targetPkg`, `targetUserId`, `persistedModeFlags`, `uri`
*   Object creation: `new GrantedUriPermission()`
