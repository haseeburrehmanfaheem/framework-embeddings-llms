After analyzing the provided Java code for the Android API `sendIntentSender`, I have identified several potential sinks that may require access control. These sinks are listed in JSON format below, ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive.

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var38.sendWithResult(param4,param5,param6,param3,param7,param8,param9);",
      "int var11 = sendInner(param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,param7,0,0,0,0,0,param8);"
    ],
    [
      "Intent var153 = new Intent(var152);",
      "PendingIntentRecord$Key var154 = this.key;",
      "Intent var155 = var154.allIntents;"
    ],
    [
      "String var157 = new String(var156);",
      "PendingIntentRecord$Key var158 = this.key;",
      "Intent var159 = var158.allIntents;"
    ],
    [
      "var491.sendActivityResult(-1,var494,var496,var498,param2,var42);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sinks are:

1. `sendWithResult` and `sendInner`: These methods are called with parameters that include sensitive data, such as the pending intent record and its associated data. The naming similarity between these methods and the API name `sendIntentSender` suggests a strong connection.

2. Creation of new Intent objects (`var153`, `var155`, and `var159`): These objects are created using data from the pending intent record and are used to propagate sensitive information. The creation of these objects is linked to the sink in rule 4, as they are used with other sink cases (e.g., `sendWithResult`).

3. Sending activity results (`var491.sendActivityResult`): This method is called with parameters that include sensitive data, such as the pending intent record and its associated data. The naming similarity between this method and the API name `sendIntentSender` suggests a strong connection.

All identified sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

* Rule 1: Method invoked in the API (e.g., `sendWithResult`, `sendInner`)
* Rule 4: Creation of new objects with dataflow from the API parameters (e.g., `var153`, `var155`, and `var159`)

The identified sinks do not follow any negative rules, such as generic utility methods or logging methods.
