After analyzing the provided Java code for the `queryEvents` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UsageStatsService var19 = this.this$0;",
      "UsageEvents var21 = var19.queryEvents(var16,param2,param3,var14);",
      "return var21;"
    ],
    [
      "UserUsageStatsService var13 = getUserDataAndInitializeIfNeededLocked(param2,var8);",
      "UsageEvents var15 = var13.queryEvents(param3,param4,param5);"
    ],
    [
      "IntervalStats var44 = this.mCurrentStats;",
      "45 = arrayload 44[5];",
      "UsageEvents$Event var46 = new UsageEvents$Event();",
      "long var48 = var45.lastTimeSaved;",
      "long var49 = var45.endTime;",
      "long var51 = Math.max(var48,var49);",
      "var46.mPackage = android;",
      "var45.addEvent(var46);"
    ],
    [
      "UsageEvents$Event var55 = new UsageEvents$Event();",
      "long var58 = System.currentTimeMillis();",
      "var55.mPackage = android;",
      "var45.addEvent(var55);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sinks are:

1. `queryEvents` method invocation: This is a sink because it has naming similarity with the API name `queryEvents`, and it takes input parameters as arguments (`param2`, `param3`, and `param4`). The return value of this method is also returned by the API.

2. `UserUsageStatsService.queryEvents` method invocation: This is a sink because it has naming similarity with the API name `queryEvents` and takes input parameters as arguments (`param3`, `param4`, and `param5`).

3. Creation of new objects (`IntervalStats`, `UsageEvents$Event`): These are sinks because they have naming similarity to the API and are created with data flow from the API parameters.

Note that some code blocks are repeated in the original code, but I've only included each block once in the identified sinks. Additionally, some variables (e.g., `var10`, `var12`) are not included as sinks because they do not follow any of the positive rules.
