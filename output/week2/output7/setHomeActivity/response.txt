Here is the JSON output with potential sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ArrayList var297 = new ArrayList();",
      "ActivityInfo var300 = getActivityInfo(var35, var42, param6);",
      "List var350 = applyPostResolutionFilter(var297, var14, param8, param5, param7, param6, var36);"
    ],
    [
      "List var228 = applyPostResolutionFilter(var96, var14, param8, param5, param7, param6, var36);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind these sinks:

1. The first sink involves creating a new ArrayList `var297` and then using it to store ActivityInfo objects in the `applyPostResolutionFilter` method call. This creates a data flow link between `var297`, `getActivityInfo`, and `applyPostResolutionFilter`. Since `var297` is created with a naming similarity to the API name (`setHomeActivity`) and its contents are processed by `applyPostResolutionFilter`, it meets one of the positive rules.
2. The second sink involves creating a List object (`var228`) in the `applyPostResolutionFilter` method call, which has a high degree of complexity and is involved in resolving intent filters for cross-profile domains. Since this list is created with data flow from API parameters (`param8`, `param5`, `param7`, `param6`, and `var36`), it meets one of the positive rules.

These sinks are ranked based on their potential sensitivity, with the first sink being more sensitive due to its direct involvement in creating a new ArrayList and processing ActivityInfo objects.
