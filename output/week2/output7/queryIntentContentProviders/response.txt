Based on the provided code, here are the identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var8 = queryIntentContentProvidersInternal(param2,param3,param4,param5);",
      "ProviderInfo var79 = getProviderInfo(var29,var15,param5);"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayList var75 = new ArrayList();",
      "ProviderInfo var21 = var19.info;"
    ],
    [
      "PackageSetting var34 = (PackageSetting) var33;",
      "boolean var37 = filterAppAccessLPr(var34,var10,param2,4,param4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

1. The first set of sinks involves the `queryIntentContentProvidersInternal` method and the creation of a `ProviderInfo` object (`var79`). This method is likely to return sensitive information about content providers.

2. The second set of sinks involves the creation of an empty `ArrayList` (`var75`) and the access to the `info` field of a `PackageParser$Provider` object (`var21`). Although the list is initially empty, it could be populated with sensitive data later on.

3. The third set of sinks involves the retrieval of a `PackageSetting` object (`var34`) from an `ArrayMap` and its subsequent use to filter app access. This suggests that the package settings are being accessed for security-related purposes.

Note that these sinks follow at least one of the positive rules (e.g., method invocation with similar naming, field access, or creation of new objects). However, please review them carefully to ensure they meet your specific requirements and do not fall under any negative rules.
