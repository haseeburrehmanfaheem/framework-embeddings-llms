Here is the analysis of the provided Android API `getActivityDisplayId`:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var8 = var6.mDisplayId;",
      "return var11;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The sink set consists of two instructions that contribute to a potential sensitive information disclosure.
- In the first instruction, `var8` is assigned the value of `mDisplayId` from the `ActivityStack` object. This field has naming similarity with the API name and its accessed field is used later in the method.
- The second instruction implies that `var11`, which has the same value as `var8` (i.e., `mDisplayId`), might be returned by the API.

Note: I did not include other instructions because they either do not follow the positive rules or are related to auxiliary operations such as boosting thread priority, logging, or obtaining an instance of a class.
