Based on the provided Java code for the `getAvailableRollbacks` API, I have identified a potential sink that requires access control.

Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var39 = this.mRollbacks;",
      "int var41 = var39.size();",
      "Object var44 = var42.get(var56);",
      "RollbackData var45 = (RollbackData) var44;",
      "RollbackInfo var48 = var45.info;",
      "boolean var50 = var37.add(var48);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation of the identified sink:

*   The `mRollbacks` field is accessed, and its size is retrieved.
*   An object is retrieved from the `mRollbacks` list using an index (`var56`).
*   The retrieved object is cast to a `RollbackData` object, and its `info` field is accessed.
*   A new `ArrayList` (`var37`) is created, and the `RollbackInfo` object is added to it.

This sink is considered sensitive because it accesses and processes rollback data stored in the `mRollbacks` list. The `ensureRollbackDataLoadedLocked()` method ensures that this data is loaded before it's accessed.
