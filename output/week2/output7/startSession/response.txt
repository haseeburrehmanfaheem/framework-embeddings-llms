Based on the provided code for the `startSession` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ContentCapturePerUserService var26 = (ContentCapturePerUserService) var25;",
      "var26.startSessionLocked(param2,var19,param4,var28,param5,param6);"
    ],
    [
      "ComponentName var34 = getServiceComponentName();",
      "String var73 = ComponentName.flattenToShortString(var34);"
    ],
    [
      "ContentCaptureServerSession var112 = (ContentCaptureServerSession) var111;",
      "SparseArray var109 = this.mSessions;"
    ],
    [
      "RemoteContentCaptureService var35 = this.mRemoteService;",
      "var35.destroy();",
      "this.mRemoteService = 0;"
    ],
    [
      "resetContentCaptureWhitelistLocked();"
    ],
    [
      "ComponentName var43 = updateServiceInfoLocked();"
    ],
    [
      "RemoteContentCaptureService var63 = new RemoteContentCaptureService();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

1. The first sink involves the `startSessionLocked` method invocation, which takes sensitive parameters such as `param2`, `var19`, and `param4`. This method is part of the `ContentCapturePerUserService` class and has high naming similarity with the API name.

2. The second sink involves accessing a `ComponentName` object using the `getServiceComponentName` method and then flattening it to a short string using the `flattenToShortString` method. Although this might not seem sensitive at first glance, it's possible that the flattened component name could be used to identify or track specific components.

3. The third sink involves accessing a `ContentCaptureServerSession` object from a sparse array using its index (`param4`). This could potentially expose sensitive information about ongoing sessions.

4. The fourth sink involves destroying a remote service instance and resetting it to null. Although this might seem harmless, it's possible that the destruction of the remote service could have unintended consequences or expose sensitive data.

5. The fifth sink involves resetting the content capture whitelist using the `resetContentCaptureWhitelistLocked` method. This could potentially expose sensitive information about whitelisted components or users.

6. The sixth sink involves updating the service info using the `updateServiceInfoLocked` method, which returns a new component name. Although this might not seem sensitive at first glance, it's possible that the updated service info could be used to identify or track specific components.

7. The seventh and final sink involves creating a new instance of the remote content capture service using the `new RemoteContentCaptureService()` constructor. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the creation of new services or instances.

Note that these sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact and the sensitivity of the data involved.
