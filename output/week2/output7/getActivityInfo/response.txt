Based on the provided code, I have identified the potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ActivityInfo var8 = getActivityInfoInternal(param2,param3,var6,param4);",
        "return var8;"
    ],
    [
        "PackageParser$Activity var26 = var24.getActivity(param2);",
        "Settings var27 = this.mSettings;",
        "ActivityInfo var28 = var26.info;",
        "boolean var30 = var27.isEnabledAndMatchLPr(var28,var11,param5);"
    ]
]
}
```

The first sink is related to the `getActivityInfoInternal` method, which returns an `ActivityInfo` object. The return statement of this object indicates that it is a potential sink.

The second sink is related to the creation and usage of the `PackageParser$Activity` object. Although there are multiple instructions involved in creating this object, they collectively contribute to a coherent data flow that eventually influences the creation and usage of sensitive information (i.e., `ActivityInfo var28`). Therefore, these instructions should be considered together as a potential sink.

Note that other variables and methods in the provided code do not meet the positive rules for identifying sinks, so they are not included in this output.
