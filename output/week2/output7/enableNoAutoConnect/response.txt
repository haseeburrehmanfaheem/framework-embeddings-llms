After analyzing the provided code for the `enableNoAutoConnect` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "this.mQuietEnableExternal = 1;",
        "this.mEnableExternal = 1;",
        "sendEnableMsg(1,1,param2);"
    ],
    [
        "BluetoothManagerService$BluetoothHandler var5 = this.mHandler;",
        "Message var9 = var5.obtainMessage(1,param2,0);",
        "boolean var11 = var5.sendMessage(var9);"
    ],
    [
        "long var14 = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();",
        "this.mLastEnabledTime = var14;"
    ]
]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

1. The first sink involves setting the `mQuietEnableExternal` and `mEnableExternal` fields to 1, followed by sending an enable message using `sendEnableMsg`. This sequence of operations suggests that the API is modifying internal state and triggering some action.
2. The second sink involves obtaining a message from the `BluetoothManagerService$BluetoothHandler` instance and sending it using `sendMessage`. This operation may be related to the previous sink, as it also seems to be triggering some action.
3. The third sink involves updating the `mLastEnabledTime` field with the current elapsed real time. While this operation appears to be a simple assignment, it's possible that this value is used in other parts of the codebase, making it a potential sink.

Note that I have not included any instructions that appear to be auxiliary operations or logging statements in the sinks. Also, I have ranked the sinks based on their apparent sensitivity and potential impact on the system.
