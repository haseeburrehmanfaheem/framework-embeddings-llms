Here is the JSON output:

```

    [
        "var28.setMasterSyncAutomatically(param2,param3,var30,var19,var21);",
        "SparseArray var43 = this.mMasterSyncAutomatically;",
        "Boolean var45 = Boolean.valueOf(param2);",
        "var43.put(param3,var45);"
    ],
    [
        "writeAccountInfoLocked();",
        "AtomicFile var15 = this.mAccountInfoFile;",
        "FileOutputStream var29 = var27.startWrite();",
        "FastXmlSerializer var30 = new FastXmlSerializer();",
        "var30.setOutput(var29,var34);",
        "Boolean var38 = Boolean.valueOf(1);",
        "var30.startDocument(0,var38);"
    ]
]
}
```

The two identified sinks are ranked based on their sensitivity. The first sink is more sensitive as it directly sets the master sync automatically for a given account and user, which could potentially reveal sensitive information about the user's syncing preferences. 

In contrast, the second sink is less sensitive but still important to track. It writes account info locked, creating an XML document that contains details of accounts on the device, which may indirectly leak some sensitive data.

Note that these identified sinks follow at least one of the positive rules: they either have high naming similarity with the API name (setMasterSyncAutomaticallyAsUser), process input parameters directly or indirectly through method invocations (param2 and param3 are used as arguments in method calls), return values from methods, create objects using data flow from API parameters, or access internal fields that are modified by the API.
