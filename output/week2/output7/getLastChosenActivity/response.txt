Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ResolveInfo var333 = new ResolveInfo();",
      "var333.activityInfo = var300;",
      "boolean var336 = var297.add(var333);"
    ],
    [
      "List var350 = applyPostResolutionFilter(var297,var14,param8,param5,param7,param6,var36);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink is related to the creation of a new `ResolveInfo` object (`var333`) and its addition to an `ArrayList` (`var297`). This object contains sensitive information about the activity, such as its package name and flags. The data flow from the input parameters (`param2`, `param3`, `param4`, etc.) to the creation of this object indicates a potential sink.

2. The second sink is related to the method invocation `applyPostResolutionFilter`. Although it does not create a new object, it processes sensitive information about the activities and returns a filtered list. The data flow from the input parameters (`var297`, `var14`, `param8`, etc.) to this method indicates a potential sink.

Note that I have ranked these sinks based on their sensitivity, with the first one being more sensitive as it creates a new object containing sensitive information.

Also, I want to mention that there are other potential sinks in the code, such as the invocation of `getActivityInfo` and `updateFlagsForResolve`, but they do not meet the positive rules as defined in the problem statement.
