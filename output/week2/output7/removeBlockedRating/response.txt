Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var12 = TvInputManagerService.access$4100(var5,var7,var9,param3,removeBlockedRating);",
      "TvContentRating var24 = TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(param2);",
      "var22.removeBlockedRating(var24);"
    ],
    [
      "List var5 = this.mBlockedRatings;",
      "boolean var7 = var5.contains(param2);",
      "boolean var10 = var8.remove(param2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink is related to the removal of a blocked rating from the PersistentDataStore. The instructions that contribute to this sink are:

1. `TvInputManagerService.access$4100(var5,var7,var9,param3,removeBlockedRating)`: This line has naming similarity with the API name and takes input parameters as arguments.
2. `TvContentRating var24 = TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(param2);`: This line creates a new `TvContentRating` object using the `param2` input parameter.
3. `var22.removeBlockedRating(var24);`: This line removes the blocked rating from the PersistentDataStore using the `TvContentRating` object created in the previous step.

The second sink is related to the removal of a blocked rating from the `mBlockedRatings` list. The instructions that contribute to this sink are:

1. `List var5 = this.mBlockedRatings;`: This line accesses the `mBlockedRatings` field.
2. `boolean var7 = var5.contains(param2);`: This line checks if the `param2` input parameter is contained in the `mBlockedRatings` list.
3. `boolean var10 = var8.remove(param2);`: This line removes the blocked rating from the `mBlockedRatings` list using the `param2` input parameter.

Both sinks are ranked as sensitive since they involve removing blocked ratings, which could potentially expose sensitive information.
