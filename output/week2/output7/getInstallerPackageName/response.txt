"Sinks": [
    [
        "String var21 = param2.name;",
        "return var21;"
    ],
    [
        "Object var9 = var7.get(param2);",

}
The above JSON indicates that there are two potential sinks in the API getInstallerPackageName. 

1. The first sink is related to param2.name, where the name field of the param2 object is accessed and its value is returned directly.

2. The second sink involves accessing a package setting using var7.get(param2) and then casting it to PackageSetting, after which it returns the installerPackageName from this package setting.

Note that some lines were removed for brevity but they are not part of any potential sinks as per the positive rules defined in the prompt. 

Ranking: Since both sinks return sensitive information (installer package name), I would rank them equally in terms of sensitivity, but since direct field access is more straightforward and potentially less prone to intermediate processing or filtering, I placed it first.
