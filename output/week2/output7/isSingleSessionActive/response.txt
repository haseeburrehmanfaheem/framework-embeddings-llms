Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var13 = TvInputManagerService.access$4100(var8,var10,var7,param2,isSingleSessionActive);",
      "TvInputManagerService$UserState var19 = TvInputManagerService.access$4200(var17[var1]var13);",
      "Map var21 = TvInputManagerService$UserState.access$1600(var19);"
    ],
    [
      "Collection var34 = var32.values();",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState var35 = new TvInputManagerService$SessionState(2);",
      "Object var37 = var34.toArray(var35);",
      "TvInputManagerService$SessionState var38 = (TvInputManagerService$SessionState) var37;"
    ],
    [
      "IBinder var41 = TvInputManagerService$SessionState.access$2700(var39);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink is identified as `access$4100`, which has a naming similarity with the API name `isSingleSessionActive` and takes input parameters (`var10`, `var7`, `param2`). This method call contributes to the creation of the `TvInputManagerService$UserState` object, which is then used to access its internal fields.

2. The second sink involves the creation of a new `TvInputManagerService$SessionState` object using the `toArray` method on the collection of user states. This array contains session state objects that are accessed later in the code.

3. The third sink involves accessing the binder for a specific session state (`var39`). 

Note: The ranking of sinks is not clearly defined, but generally speaking, the first sink which retrieves user state information seems more sensitive as it directly deals with internal user data.
