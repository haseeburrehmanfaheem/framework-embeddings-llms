Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "String var5 = var3.getKey(param2);", 
      "String var12 = getAlias(var10[var8],param2);",
      "String var27 = getInternalAlias(param2,param3,param4);"
    ],
    [
      "KeyStore var32 = this.mKeystoreService;",
      "String var34 = var32.grant(var31,param3);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

The API `getKey` contains two potential sink sets.

1. The first set of instructions (`var5`, `var12`, and `var27`) collectively contribute to a sink because they all access or retrieve sensitive data (`alias`, `key`, etc.) that is related to the input parameter `param2`. These variables are then used in subsequent operations, indicating a potential flow of sensitive data.

2. The second set of instructions (`var32` and `var34`) forms another sink because it involves accessing a keystore service and granting access to some resource (`var31`). This operation is security-sensitive and might be subject to access control restrictions.

Note that I've ignored the repeated code blocks as they seem to be duplicates, and focused on the unique instructions that contribute to potential sinks. Also, `Preconditions.checkNotNull` calls are not considered as sinks as they are used for input validation/sanity checks, which is one of the negative rules specified in the problem statement.
