Here is the JSON output with potential sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UsageStatsService var14 = this.this$0;",
      "UsageEvents var16 = var14.queryEventsForPackage(var8,param2,param3,param4,var11);",
      "return var16;" // Although not explicitly shown in the code, it's likely that the API returns the UsageEvents object.
    ],
    [
      "UserUsageStatsService var9 = new UserUsageStatsService();",
      "var9.init(param3);"
    ],
    [
      "IntervalStats var6 = this.mCurrentStats;",
      "45 = arrayload 44[5];",
      "UsageEvents$Event var46 = new UsageEvents$Event();",
      "long var48 = var45.lastTimeSaved;",
      "long var49 = var45.endTime;",
      "long var51 = Math.max(var48,var49);",
      "var46.mPackage = android;",
      "var45.addEvent(var46);"
    ],
    [
      "UsageEvents$Event var55 = new UsageEvents$Event();",
      "long var58 = System.currentTimeMillis();",
      "var55.mPackage = android;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Please note that some of the lines in the original code seem to be repeated and might not be actual part of the API, I have tried my best to identify potential sinks based on the rules you provided.
