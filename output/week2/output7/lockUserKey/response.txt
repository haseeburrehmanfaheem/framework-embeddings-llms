Here is the analysis of the provided Java code for potential sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "IVold var5 = this.mVold;",
        "var5.lockUserKey(param2);"
    ],
    [
        "[I var13 = this.mLocalUnlockedUsers;",
        "[I var15 = ArrayUtils.removeInt(var13,param2);",
        "this.mLocalUnlockedUsers = var15;"
    ]
]
}
```

Explanation of identified sinks:

1. The first sink set includes two instructions that contribute to a potential sink:
   - `IVold var5 = this.mVold;` accesses an internal field (`mVold`) and assigns it to a local variable `var5`.
   - `var5.lockUserKey(param2);` invokes the `lockUserKey` method on the `var5` object, passing in `param2`. This instruction has naming similarity with the API name `lockUserKey` and processes the input parameter `param2`.

2. The second sink set includes three instructions that contribute to a potential sink:
   - `[I var13 = this.mLocalUnlockedUsers;` accesses an internal field (`mLocalUnlockedUsers`) and assigns it to a local variable `var13`.
   - `[I var15 = ArrayUtils.removeInt(var13,param2);` invokes the `removeInt` method on the `ArrayUtils` class, passing in `var13` (which is `mLocalUnlockedUsers`) and `param2`. This instruction modifies an internal field (`mLocalUnlockedUsers`) with the API parameter `param2`.
   - `this.mLocalUnlockedUsers = var15;` updates the internal field (`mLocalUnlockedUsers`) with the result of the previous instruction.

Both sink sets follow at least one positive rule and do not match any negative rules. They are ranked in this order because the first set has a direct dataflow link to the API's parameter `param2`, while the second set also processes `param2` but does not have a direct return value or creation of new objects that propagate sensitive data.
