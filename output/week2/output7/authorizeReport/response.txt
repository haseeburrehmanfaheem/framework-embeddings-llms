Here is the JSON output with potential sinks identified:

      "-$$Lambda$PendingReports$42Ba6ZxAFxFmqtPlfnXNpuKHOXM var11 = new -$$Lambda$PendingReports$42Ba6ZxAFxFmqtPlfnXNpuKHOXM();",
      "var8.enqueue(var10,1,var11);"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayList var5 = this.mPending;",

      "Object var26 = var24.remove(var20);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

The code has two potential sink sets. 

1. The first set involves the `authorizeReport` method invocation, which takes multiple parameters (`param2` to `param7`). This method call is a clear indication of a sensitive operation being performed. Additionally, the output of this method call (if any) is not explicitly returned but could be implicitly used in subsequent operations. 

   The following instructions collectively contribute to this sink set:
    - `var13.authorizeReport(param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,param7);`
    - `RequestQueue var8 = this.mRequestQueue;` and `-$$Lambda$PendingReports$42Ba6ZxAFxFmqtPlfnXNpuKHOXM var11 = new -$$Lambda$PendingReports$42Ba6ZxAFxFmqtPlfnXNpuKHOXM();`, which create a new `RequestQueue` object that will be used to enqueue the request. 
    - `var8.enqueue(var10,1,var11);` enqueues the request.

2. The second set involves multiple instructions that access and modify the `ArrayList` `mPending`. Although this does not directly indicate a sensitive operation, it might involve internal data modification or propagation of the API parameters (`param2` to `param7`) through subsequent operations. 

   However, upon careful analysis, there is no clear indication that any of these instructions directly propagate the input parameters or modify fields with naming similarity to the API. Therefore, this set does not follow at least one of the positive rules and should be disregarded.

3. Instructions like `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` are auxiliary operations, while logging statements (not present in this code) would fall under negative rules as per the provided instructions.
