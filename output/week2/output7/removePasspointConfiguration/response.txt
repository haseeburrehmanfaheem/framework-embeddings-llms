Here is the analysis of the code in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean var40 = var37.syncRemovePasspointConfig(var38,var17,param2);",
      "Message var8 = sendMessageSynchronously(131179,param3,0,param4);"
    ],
    [
      "Message var7 = Message.obtain();",
      "var7.what = param2;",
      "var7.arg1 = param3;",
      "var7.arg2 = param4;",
      "var7.obj = param5;",
      "Message var9 = sendMessageSynchronously(var7);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The two sink sets are identified as follows:

1. The first set of instructions (`var40` and `var8`) involve the removal of passpoint configuration and sending a message synchronously. These actions have a direct impact on the system's configuration and may require access control.

2. The second set of instructions (`var7` and `var9`) create a new message object, populate its fields with parameters from the API call, and send it synchronously. This sequence also has a potential impact on the system's behavior and may be subject to access control.
