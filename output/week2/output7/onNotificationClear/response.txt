Here is the analysis of the API `onNotificationClear`:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var17.onNotificationClear(var12,var14,param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,param7,param8,param9);",
      "var20.recordDismissalSurface(param9);"
    ],
    [
      "var36.cancelNotification(param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,0,66,1,param7,2,var40,var41,0);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The two identified sinks are:

1. The first sink is a combination of `onNotificationClear` method invocation and the subsequent call to `recordDismissalSurface`. This is because both methods have high naming similarity with the API name `onNotificationClear`, and they process the input parameters.
2. The second sink is the `cancelNotification` method invocation, which has high naming similarity with the API name `onNotificationClear` and processes the input parameters.

Note that I excluded other instructions from being considered as sinks because they either do not have naming similarity with the API name or do not process the input parameters in a way that would make them sensitive. Additionally, some instructions are auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining an instance of a class) or logging methods, which are explicitly excluded by the negative rules.

Ranking these sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive, I placed the first sink at the top because it involves two method calls with high naming similarity and parameter processing. The second sink is still sensitive but ranked lower as it only involves one method call.
