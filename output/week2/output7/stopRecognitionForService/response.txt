After analyzing the code of the `stopRecognitionForService` API, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the list of sinks in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UUID var44 = getUuid();",
      "Object var46 = var42.get(var44);",
      "SoundTrigger$SoundModel var47 = (SoundTrigger$SoundModel) var46;",
      "int var65 = var47.type;"
    ],
    [
      "UUID var55 = getUuid();",
      "Object var57 = var53.get(var55);",
      "IRecognitionStatusCallback var58 = (IRecognitionStatusCallback) var57;"
    ],
    [
      "UUID var70 = var47.uuid;",
      "int var72 = var69.stopGenericRecognition(var70, var58);"
    ],
    [
      "Object var13 = var11.get(param2);",
      "SoundTriggerHelper$ModelData var14 = (SoundTriggerHelper$ModelData) var13;",
      "boolean var16 = var14.isGenericModel();",
      "int var18 = stopRecognition(var14, param3);"
    ],
    [
      "setRequested(0);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Each array in the `Sinks` list represents a coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink. The data flow between these instructions is as follows:

1. The first sink retrieves a `SoundTrigger$SoundModel` object from a map using a UUID, and then extracts its type.
2. The second sink retrieves an `IRecognitionStatusCallback` object from another map using a UUID.
3. The third sink uses the retrieved `SoundTrigger$SoundModel` object's UUID to stop generic recognition, passing the retrieved `IRecognitionStatusCallback` object as an argument.
4. The fourth sink retrieves a `SoundTriggerHelper$ModelData` object from a map using a parameter, checks if it is a generic model, and then stops recognition using this object and another parameter.
5. The fifth sink simply sets a requested flag to 0.

These sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

* Sinks 1-3 have high naming similarity with the API name `stopRecognitionForService`.
* Sink 4 takes input parameters as arguments (`param2` and `param3`).
* All sinks return or modify sensitive data, such as `SoundTrigger$SoundModel`, `IRecognitionStatusCallback`, and `SoundTriggerHelper$ModelData` objects.

Note that I have ignored generic utility methods (e.g., `getUuid()`, `asBinder()`), logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, and auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining a lock) when identifying potential sinks.
