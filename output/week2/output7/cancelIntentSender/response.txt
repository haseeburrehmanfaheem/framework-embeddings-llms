Here is the analysis of the provided Java code for potential sinks that require access control:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "PendingIntentController var3 = this.mPendingIntentController;",
        "var3.cancelIntentSender(param2);",
        "cancelIntentSender(var6,1);"
    ],
    [
        "makeIntentSenderCanceled(param2);"
    ],
    [
        "param2.canceled = 1;"
    ],
    [
        "HashMap var6 = this.mIntentSenderRecords;",
        "Object var9 = var6.remove(var7);",
        "PendingIntentRecord$Key var11 = param2.key;",
        "IBinder var12 = var11.activity;"
    ],
    [
        "Message var18 = PooledLambda.obtainMessage(var13,this,var15,var16);"
    ]
]
}
```

This code has multiple potential sinks that may require access control. 

1. The `cancelIntentSender()` method invocation on the `PendingIntentController` object is a sink because it takes the input parameter `param2` as an argument and has naming similarity with the API name.

2. The `makeIntentSenderCanceled(param2)` method invocation is a sink because it takes the input parameter `param2` as an argument and returns a value that is used by other instructions in the code.

3. The `param2.canceled = 1` statement is a sink because it updates a field of the object referenced by `param2`, which has naming similarity with the API name.

4. The removal of an element from the `HashMap var6` using the key `var7` and the subsequent access to the activity binder are sinks because they have naming similarity with the API name and return values that may be sensitive.

5. The creation of a new `Message` object using the `PooledLambda.obtainMessage()` method is a sink because it creates an object with dataflow from the API parameters.

All these potential sinks should be subject to access control checks to ensure the security of the system.
