Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "StorageStats var63 = StorageStatsService.translate(var18);",
      "var2.codeBytes = var6;",
      "var2.dataBytes = var9;",
      "return var2;" // implied return statement, not explicitly present in the code snippet
    ],
    [
      "Installer var20 = this.mInstaller;",
      "var20.getUserSize(param2,param3,var22,var17,var18);",
      "StorageStatsService.checkEquals(var53,var28,var18);"
    ],
    [
      "IInstalld var10 = this.mInstalld;",
      "[J var12 = var10.getUserSize(param2,param3,param4,param5);",
      "param6.codeSize = var15;",
      "param6.dataSize = var19;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink is related to the creation and return of a `StorageStats` object (`var63`). This object is created by translating another `PackageStats` object (`var18`) using the `StorageStatsService.translate()` method. The resulting `StorageStats` object contains sensitive information about storage usage, which is then returned.

2. The second sink involves the invocation of the `getUserSize()` method on an `Installer` object (`var20`). This method takes several parameters, including user IDs and package names, and returns storage usage statistics for the specified users and packages. Although this method call itself does not directly contribute to a sink, it is part of a larger data flow that ultimately leads to sensitive information being accessed or modified.

3. The third sink involves another invocation of the `getUserSize()` method, this time on an `IInstalld` object (`var10`). Similar to the previous case, this method call contributes to a larger data flow involving storage usage statistics and potentially sensitive information.

In each of these sinks, there is a clear data flow link between the instructions listed. The output of one instruction directly influences the input or creation of the next, making them coherent sets of instructions that together form potential sinks.
