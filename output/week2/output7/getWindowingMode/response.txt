Here is the JSON output with potential sinks identified in the provided code:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var18 = var16.getWindowingModeLocked(var15);",
      "return var18;"
    ],
    [
      "DisplayWindowSettings$Entry var4 = new DisplayWindowSettings$Entry();",
      "String var6 = getIdentifier(param3);",
      "Object var15 = var11.put(var13,var4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

However, the API `getWindowingMode` does not explicitly return any value. So we should consider only those sinks which are returned or used later in the code.

In this case, `var18` is not explicitly returned but it can be considered as a sink if there's any other method that returns its value.

The second set of instructions creates and modifies a new `DisplayWindowSettings$Entry` object with data from API parameters (`param2`, `param3`). Since this object is put into the `mEntries` map, it is used later in the code. 

So, we will consider only the second sink:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "DisplayWindowSettings$Entry var4 = new DisplayWindowSettings$Entry();",
      "String var6 = getIdentifier(param3);",
      "Object var15 = var11.put(var13,var4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```
