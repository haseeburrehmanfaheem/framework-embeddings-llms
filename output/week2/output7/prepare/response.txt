Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var16 = PackageManagerServiceUtils.getPackagesForDexopt(var12,var13,1);",
      "ArrayList var4 = new ArrayList();",
      "LinkedList var6 = new LinkedList();",
      "PackageManagerServiceUtils.applyPackageFilter(var12,var6,var4,param2);",
      "Object var45 = Collections.max(var4,var43);"
    ],
    [
      "String var88 = PackageManagerServiceUtils.packagesToString(var6);",
      "String var101 = PackageManagerServiceUtils.packagesToString(var4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind identifying these sinks:

1. The first sink set involves the creation of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` objects, which are used to store package information. The `PackageManagerServiceUtils.getPackagesForDexopt` method is invoked with input parameters `var12` and `var13`, which are then processed by the `applyPackageFilter` method. This method returns a filtered list of packages, which is stored in `var4`. The output of this sink set is sensitive because it contains package information that could be used for malicious purposes.

2. The second sink set involves the conversion of package lists to strings using the `packagesToString` method. These strings are then assigned to `var88` and `var101`. This sink set is less sensitive than the first one, but still requires access control because it handles potentially sensitive package information.

I ranked these sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on system security. The first sink set has a higher sensitivity ranking because it involves creating objects that store sensitive package information, while the second sink set is less sensitive because it only converts existing package lists to strings.
