After analyzing the provided Java code for the `addBlockedRating` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "TvContentRating var24 = TvContentRating.unflattenFromString(param2);",
        "var22.addBlockedRating(var24);"
    ],
    [
        "List var8 = this.mBlockedRatings;",
        "boolean var10 = var8.add(param2);"
    ]
]
}
```

The identified sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive. The first sink involves the creation of a `TvContentRating` object and its addition to the `PersistentDataStore`. This is considered more sensitive as it directly affects the stored ratings.

The second sink involves adding the input parameter `param2` to the `mBlockedRatings` list. While this is still a potential sink, it is ranked lower in sensitivity compared to the first sink, as it only affects the internal state of the object and not external storage.

Note that I have excluded certain instructions from being considered sinks due to the negative rules provided (e.g., logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, auxiliary operations).
