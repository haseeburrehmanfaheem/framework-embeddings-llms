Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `queryIntentReceivers`, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "List var9 = queryIntentReceiversInternal(param2,param3,param4,param5,0);",
        "ParceledListSlice var6 = new ParceledListSlice();"
    ],
    [
        "int var12 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
        "String var17 = getInstantAppPackageName(var12);",
        "int var19 = updateFlagsForResolve(param4,param5,param2,var12,0);"
    ],
    [
        "ComponentName var21 = getComponent();",
        "Intent var23 = getSelector();",
        "Intent var28 = getSelector();",
        "ComponentName var30 = var28.getComponent();"
    ],
    [
        "ActivityInfo var72 = getReceiverInfo(var33,var19,param5);",
        "boolean var37 = filterAppAccessLPr(var34,var10,param2,2,param4);"
    ]
]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink set involves calling `queryIntentReceiversInternal` and creating a new `ParceledListSlice`. This is highly sensitive as it returns a list of intent receivers that can be used by malicious apps.

2. The second sink set involves getting the calling UID, instant app package name, and updating flags for resolve. While this sink set is not directly returning sensitive data, it does provide information about the app's permissions and flags.

3. The third sink set involves getting component names and intents from selectors. This can be considered a moderate-risk sink as it returns metadata about the components and intents.

4. The fourth sink set involves getting receiver info and filtering app access. While this sink set is not directly returning sensitive data, it does provide information about the app's permissions and access control.

Note that these rankings are subjective and may vary based on specific security requirements and threat models.
