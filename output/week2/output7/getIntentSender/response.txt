Here is the JSON output for the sinks identified in the `getIntentSender` API:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "PendingIntentRecord var124 = var122.getIntentSender(param2,param3,var55,var64,param4,param5,param6,param7,param8,param9,param10);",
        "var92.allIntents = param9;",
        "var93.allResolvedTypes = param10;"
    ],
    [
        "PendingIntentRecord$Key var35 = new PendingIntentRecord$Key();",
        "HashMap var39 = this.mIntentSenderRecords;",
        "Object var41 = var39.get(var35);"
    ]
]
}
```

Explanation:

*   The first sink is related to the creation of a `PendingIntentRecord` object and its fields being modified with the API parameters (`param9` and `param10`). This sink follows the positive rule 4, where an object is created using data flow from the API parameters.
*   The second sink is related to the creation of a `PendingIntentRecord$Key` object and its usage in accessing a field in the `mIntentSenderRecords` HashMap. Although this does not directly modify any sensitive fields, it's still considered a potential sink as it involves the creation of an object that will be used to access other data, thus having a clear data flow link between them.

Ranking: The first sink is ranked higher than the second one because it involves direct modification of fields with API parameters, which is generally more sensitive.
