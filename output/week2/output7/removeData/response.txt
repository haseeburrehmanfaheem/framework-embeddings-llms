Here is the JSON output for the provided API `removeData`:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ContentCapturePerUserService var17 = (ContentCapturePerUserService) var16;",
      "var17.removeDataLocked(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "Object var27 = LocalServices.getService(var25);",
      "ActivityManagerInternal var28 = (ActivityManagerInternal) var27;",
      "boolean var30 = var28.hasRunningActivity(var8,param2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind identifying these two sink sets:

1. The first set of instructions involves creating a `ContentCapturePerUserService` object and calling its `removeDataLocked` method with the input parameter `param2`. This method invocation directly processes the input data, which makes it a potential sink.

2. The second set of instructions involves getting an instance of `ActivityManagerInternal` using `LocalServices.getService`, casting it to `ActivityManagerInternal`, and then calling its `hasRunningActivity` method with the parameters `var8` (calling UID) and `param2`. Although `var8` is not directly derived from the input parameter, it's still related to the calling context. The call to `hasRunningActivity` might indirectly process sensitive information, making this a potential sink.

Both of these sink sets follow at least one of the positive rules: method invocations with naming similarity or processing input parameters.
