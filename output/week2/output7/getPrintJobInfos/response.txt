Based on the provided code, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var19 = var15.getPrintJobInfos(var12);",
      "UserState$PrintJobForAppCache var3 = this.mPrintJobForAppCache;",
      "List var5 = var3.getPrintJobs(param2);",
      "ArrayMap var6 = new ArrayMap();"
    ],
    [
      "RemotePrintSpooler var25 = this.mSpooler;",
      "List var28 = var25.getPrintJobInfos(0,-1,param2);"
    ],
    [
      "UserState var15 = getOrCreateUserStateLocked(var5,0);",
      "Object var12 = var5.get(var22);",
      "PrintJobInfo var13 = (PrintJobInfo) var12;"
    ],
    [
      "UserState var6 = getOrCreateUserStateLocked(param2,param3,1);",
      "SparseArray var23 = this.mUserStates;",
      "Object var25 = var23.get(param2);",
      "UserState var26 = (UserState) var25;",
      "UserState var27 = new UserState();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sinks are:

1. The first sink is related to retrieving print job information for a specific user and app. It involves getting the print job info list from `UserState` and creating an `ArrayMap`. This sink has high sensitivity as it deals with sensitive user data.
2. The second sink involves retrieving print job information from the remote print spooler using the `RemotePrintSpooler` class. This sink also deals with sensitive user data.
3. The third sink is related to accessing and modifying print job information for a specific user. It involves getting the print job info object from the list and setting its tag and advanced options.
4. The fourth sink involves creating a new `UserState` object and adding it to the sparse array of user states. This sink has moderate sensitivity as it deals with user data, but it's not as sensitive as the other sinks.

The ranking of sinks is subjective, but based on the provided code, I would rank them in order of highest sensitivity:

1. Sink 1: Retrieving print job information for a specific user and app
2. Sink 2: Retrieving print job information from the remote print spooler
3. Sink 3: Accessing and modifying print job information for a specific user
4. Sink 4: Creating a new `UserState` object and adding it to the sparse array of user states
