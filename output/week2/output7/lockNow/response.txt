Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var3.lockNow(param2);",
      "var10.setLockOptions(param2);",
      "this.options = param2;"
    ],
    [
      "var7.removeCallbacks(var8);"
    ],
    [
      "boolean var17 = var14.post(var15);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink set is the most sensitive, as it involves locking the screen and setting lock options, which directly affects the device's security. It meets the positive rule of having naming similarity with the API name `lockNow` and processing the input parameter `param2`.

2. The second sink is relatively less sensitive, as it only removes callbacks from a handler. However, it still contributes to the overall functionality of the API and can potentially impact the device's behavior.

3. The third sink is also relatively less sensitive, as it posts a new callback to a handler. While this action may have some implications for the device's behavior, its sensitivity is lower compared to the first sink set.

Note that I ranked the sinks based on their potential impact on the device's security and functionality. If you need further clarification or have any specific requirements for ranking, please let me know!
