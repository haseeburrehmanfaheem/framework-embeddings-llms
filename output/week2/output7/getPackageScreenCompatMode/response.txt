Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "int var9 = var7.getPackageScreenCompatModeLocked(param2);",
        "ApplicationInfo var7 = var5.getApplicationInfo(param2,0,0);",
        "String var3 = param2.packageName;",
        "int var5 = getPackageFlags(var3);"
    ],
    [
        "Configuration var13 = var11.getGlobalConfiguration();",
        "RootActivityContainer var2 = this.mRootActivityContainer;",
        "Configuration var4 = var2.getConfiguration();"
    ]
]
}
```

The ranking of sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive is as follows:

1. The first sink array contains instructions that access and process package information, including the package name and flags. This information can be considered sensitive, and its exposure could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.
2. The second sink array involves accessing global configuration and root activity container information. While this data may not be as sensitive as package-specific information, it still represents a potential exposure of system-level data.

Both sink arrays follow the positive rules outlined in the problem statement:

* Method invocations with naming similarity (e.g., `getPackageScreenCompatModeLocked`, `getApplicationInfo`)
* Field accesses and updates with naming similarity (e.g., `packageName`, `packageFlags`)
* Object creation using API parameters (not explicitly shown, but implied through method calls)

Note that the provided code appears to be a jumbled mix of different methods and variables. To improve accuracy, it would be beneficial to analyze the original, unobfuscated code.
