Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `setRingerModeExternal`, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. The analysis is based on the rules you provided.

Here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var51 = var48.onSetRingerModeExternal(var33, var26, param3, var31, var49);",
      "setRingerModeInt(var53, 1);"
    ],
    [
      "this.mRingerMode = param2;"
    ],
    [
      "var114.mute(0);",
      "int var116 = this.mRingerAndZenModeMutedStreams;",
      "var117 = 1 SHL var144;",
      "118 = bitnot 117;",
      "var119 = var116 and var118;",
      "this.mRingerAndZenModeMutedStreams = var119;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive, I would place them in the following order:

1. The first sink is related to setting the ringer mode externally and internally, which involves multiple method calls and updates to internal state variables.
2. The second sink is a simple assignment of `param2` to `this.mRingerMode`, but it still has some sensitivity as it affects the device's audio behavior.
3. The third sink is related to muting streams based on ringer mode and Zen mode settings, which involves multiple method calls and updates to internal state variables.

Each array in 'Sinks' represents a coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink, with a clear data flow link between themâ€”meaning the output of one instruction directly influences the input or creation of the next. If there is no direct data propagation between instructions, separate them into different sink arrays.
