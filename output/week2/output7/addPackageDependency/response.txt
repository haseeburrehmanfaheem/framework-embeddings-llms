Reasoning:

1. The first sink is identified as the series of instructions that update the `pkgDeps` field of a `ProcessRecord` object, which has naming similarity with the API name `addPackageDependency`. This sink propagates the input parameter `param2` to the `pkgDeps` set.

2. The second sink involves updating the thread priority using the `ThreadPriorityBooster$PriorityState` object and then calling `Process.setThreadPriority()`, which has naming similarity with the API name `addPackageDependency`. This sink updates internal fields, but does not directly propagate any input parameters to a sensitive operation. 

Note that both sinks follow at least one of the positive rules: having naming similarity with the API name or updating internal fields that are then used in other operations.

Ranking:
The first sink is ranked higher than the second sink because it directly propagates an input parameter (`param2`) to a sensitive data structure (`pkgDeps` set), whereas the second sink updates internal state but does not have a clear propagation of input parameters.
