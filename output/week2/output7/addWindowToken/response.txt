Here is the JSON output:

    [
      "DisplayContent var9 = new DisplayContent();",
      "var13.applySettingsToDisplayLocked(var9);",
      "var9.initializeDisplayOverrideConfiguration();"

      "WindowManagerService var16 = this.mWmService;",
      "DisplayManagerInternal var17 = var16.mDisplayManagerInternal;",
      "DisplayInfo var21 = var9.getDisplayInfo();",
      "var19.setDisplayInfoOverrideFromWindowManager(var5,var21);"
    ],
    [
      "var9.configureDisplayPolicy();",
      "WindowManagerService var27 = this.mWmService;",
      "var27.reconfigureDisplayLocked(var9);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the identified sinks:

1. The first sink set involves creating a new `DisplayContent` object and applying settings to it using the `applySettingsToDisplayLocked` method. This is a sensitive operation as it involves configuring display settings.

2. The second sink set involves getting the display info from the newly created `DisplayContent` object and setting it as an override for the display manager internal. This operation is also sensitive as it involves modifying display settings.

3. The third sink set involves configuring the display policy and reconfiguring the display using the `reconfigureDisplayLocked` method. These operations are sensitive as they involve changing the display configuration.

All of these sink sets follow at least one of the positive rules, such as having naming similarity with the API name or taking input parameters as arguments. They also do not match any negative rules, such as being generic utility methods or logging methods.
