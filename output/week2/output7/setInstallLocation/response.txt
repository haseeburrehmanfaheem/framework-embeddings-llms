After analyzing the code of the `setInstallLocation` API, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var8 = getInstallLocation();", 
      "boolean var17 = Settings$Global.putInt(var14,default_install_location,param2);"
    ],
    [
      "String var5 = Integer.toString(param3);",
      "boolean var7 = Settings$Global.putString(this,param2,var5);"
    ],
    [
      "int var5 = getUserId();",
      "boolean var8 = Settings$Global.putStringForUser(this,param2,param3,0,0,var5);"
    ],
    [
      "HashSet var7 = MOVED_TO_SECURE;",
      "boolean var9 = var7.contains(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "Settings$NameValueCache var11 = sNameValueCache;",
      "boolean var13 = var11.putStringForUser(this,param2,param3,param4,param5,param6);"
    ],
    [
      "boolean var30 = Settings$Secure.putStringForUser(this,param2,param3,param4,param5,param6);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. `Settings$Global.putInt` and `Settings$Global.putString`: These methods modify global settings, which can have a significant impact on the system.
2. `Settings$Secure.putStringForUser`: This method modifies secure settings for a specific user, which can also have a significant impact on the system.
3. `getUserId`: This method retrieves the user ID of the current user, which can be used to access sensitive information.
4. `MOVED_TO_SECURE.contains`: This method checks if an app has been moved to a secure location, which can indicate that the app is handling sensitive data.
5. `Settings$NameValueCache.putStringForUser`: This method caches settings for a specific user, which can potentially store sensitive information.

Note that some of these methods may have additional validation or security checks in place, but based on the provided code alone, they appear to be potential sinks that require access control.
