Here is the analysis of potential sinks in the provided code:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "MediaProjectionManagerService$MediaProjection var16 = MediaProjectionManagerService.access$900(var14);",
      "var19.stop();"
    ],
    [
      "IMediaProjectionCallback var17 = this.mCallback;",
      "unregisterCallback(var17);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

There are two potential sinks identified in the provided code:

1. The first sink involves the `MediaProjectionManagerService$MediaProjection` object being accessed and its `stop()` method being called. This could potentially be a sensitive operation that requires access control.

2. The second sink involves the `IMediaProjectionCallback` object being unregistered using the `unregisterCallback(var17)` method. This could also potentially be a sensitive operation that requires access control.

Note that both sinks follow the positive rules for identifying potential sinks, specifically having naming similarity with the API name (`stopActiveProjection`) and being directly related to the input parameters or return values of the API.
