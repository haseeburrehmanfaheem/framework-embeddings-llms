Here is the analysis of the provided Java code for potential sinks that require access control, following the specified rules and guidelines.

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "boolean var28 = var26.getSyncAutomatically(param2,param4,param3);",  
        "return var28;"  // Not explicitly present in the code but assumed as it's a typical practice to return the result of get methods.
    ],
    [
        "SyncStorageEngine$AuthorityInfo var16 = (SyncStorageEngine$AuthorityInfo) var15;",
        "boolean var21 = var17.matchesSpec(var18);",  
        "boolean var22 = var16.enabled;"  
    ]
]
}
```
Here is the explanation of identified potential sinks:

1. The first sink array represents a method invocation with high naming similarity to `getSyncAutomatically` and uses its input parameters (`param2`, `param4`, and `param3`). However, since there's no explicit return statement in the provided code snippet for this variable, we assume that it will be returned (typical practice for getter methods). This indicates a potential sink where sensitive information about sync automation is retrieved.

2. The second sink array represents an object (`var16`) of type `SyncStorageEngine$AuthorityInfo` which seems to contain sensitive authority information and its attributes are used later in the code, specifically its `enabled` state and target endpoint matching a spec. This could be considered as handling or processing sensitive data related to sync authorities.

Note: The absence of explicit return statements for some variables makes it challenging to identify clear sinks. It's essential to analyze the entire method (if possible) to understand how these variables are used further in the codebase.
