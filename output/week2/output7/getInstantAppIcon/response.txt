Based on the provided Java code for the `getInstantAppIcon` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Bitmap var23 = var21.getInstantAppIconLPw(param2,param3);",
      "return var23;" // implicit return statement not shown in the code snippet
    ],
    [
      "ComponentName var37 = new ComponentName();",
      "var37.setPackageName(var39);", 
      "var37.setClassName(var41);" 
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink set includes the creation and return of a `Bitmap` object (`var23`) which is obtained by calling the `getInstantAppIconLPw` method on an `InstantAppRegistry` instance. This object is directly influenced by the input parameters `param2` and `param3`, making it a potential sink.

2. The second sink set includes the creation of a new `ComponentName` object (`var37`) which is then used to store sensitive information such as package name and class name. Although not explicitly returned, this object's creation can be considered a sink due to its naming similarity with the API and influence from the input parameters.

Note that some instructions have been omitted in the provided code snippet (e.g., return statements), but based on the given context, it is reasonable to assume their presence.
