Here is the JSON output with identified sinks:
```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var12 = getWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions(param2,param4,param5);",
      "Object var35 = var33.get(param2);",
      "PackageSetting var36 = (PackageSetting) var35;",
      "String var46 = var36.installerPackageName;"
    ],
    [
      "int var50 = var49.appId;",
      "boolean var54 = UserHandle.isSameApp(var50,var52);"
    ]
  ]
}
```
The identified sinks are:

1. The first sink is related to the `getWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions` method, which returns a list of whitelisted restricted permissions for the given package. This method takes three parameters: `param2`, `param4`, and `param5`. The output of this method is stored in the `var12` variable.

   The subsequent instructions are related to accessing fields from the `PackageSetting` object, which was obtained by calling `getWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions` with `param2`. This includes obtaining the installer package name (`var46`) and other package-related information. These instructions collectively form a sink because they access sensitive data (whitelisted restricted permissions) based on the input parameters.

2. The second sink is related to accessing the `appId` field from the `PackageSetting` object (`var49`). This instruction has high naming similarity with the API name `addWhitelistedRestrictedPermission`, and also accesses a sensitive field (`appId`) that might be used for making security decisions.
