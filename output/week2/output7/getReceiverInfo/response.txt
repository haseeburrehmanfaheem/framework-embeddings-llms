Here is the analysis of the provided Java code for potential sinks that require access control. 

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ComponentResolver var17 = this.mComponentResolver;",
        "PackageParser$Activity var19 = var17.getReceiver(param2);",
        "Settings var20 = this.mSettings;",
        "ActivityInfo var21 = var19.info;"
    ],
    [
        "ArrayMap var29 = var28.mPackages;",
        "String var31 = getPackageName();",
        "Object var33 = var29.get(var31);",
        "PackageSetting var34 = (PackageSetting) var33;"
    ],
    [
        "ComponentResolver var22 = this.mComponentResolver;",
        "PackageParser$Service var24 = var22.getService(param2);"
    ],
    [
        "ArrayMap var40 = this.mInstrumentation;",
        "Object var42 = var40.get(param4);",
        "PackageParser$Instrumentation var43 = (PackageParser$Instrumentation) var42;",
        "InstrumentationInfo var44 = var43.info;"
    ]
]
}
```

Explanation:

1.  The first set of instructions represent a sink where the API gets a receiver component, retrieves its activity info and settings. This is considered sensitive information as it involves the retrieval of specific app components.

2.  The second set of instructions show how the API accesses package information by retrieving the package name and then getting the package setting from the array map `mPackages`. This can be a sink because accessing a package's information may require certain permissions, especially when it comes to sensitive information like package settings.

3.  The third set is similar in nature as the first one but this time for services instead of receivers. 

4.  The last set represents how an instrumentation object is retrieved and then its info accessed from `mInstrumentation` array map which is another example where access control might be necessary depending on what type of information or actions it allows.

In terms of ranking, the most sensitive sinks are likely related to retrieving package settings (`var34 = (PackageSetting) var33;`) or instrumentation objects (`InstrumentationInfo var44 = var43.info;`), as these may expose more private or system-specific data. However, without knowing the exact purpose and context in which this code is being used, it's hard to make a definitive ranking of sensitivity for each sink set.
