After analyzing the provided Java code for the Android API `isAppStartModeDisabled`, I identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var9 = getAppStartModeLocked(param2,param3,0,-1,0,1,0);",
      "boolean var13 = var11.idle;",
      "boolean var20 = var16.isPackageEphemeral(var18,param3);",
      "int var27 = appRestrictedInBackgroundLocked(param2,param3,param4);"
    ],
    [
      "UidRecord var11 = var9.getUidRecordLocked(param2);",
      "PackageManagerInternal var16 = getPackageManagerInternalLocked();",
      "boolean var13 = this.mForceBackgroundCheck;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink array includes instructions that collectively contribute to the determination of whether an app's start mode is disabled. The methods `getAppStartModeLocked`, `isPackageEphemeral`, and `appRestrictedInBackgroundLocked` are invoked with input parameters `param2` and `param3`, which are used to determine the app's start mode.

The second sink array includes instructions that access internal fields and objects, such as `UidRecord` and `PackageManagerInternal`. These accesses may be sensitive and require proper authorization.

Note that I excluded some variables and assignments from the output, as they do not contribute to the determination of the app's start mode or access sensitive data.
