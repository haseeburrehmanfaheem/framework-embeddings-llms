After analyzing the provided Java code for the `getInstallationProgress` API in the `DynamicSystemService_1` service, I identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "IGsiService var3 = getGsiService();",
      "String var5 = SystemProperties.get(init.svc.gsid);",
      "boolean var8 = equals(var5);",
      "SystemProperties.set(ctl.start,gsid);"
    ],
    [
      "IBinder var4 = ServiceManager.getService(gsiservice);",
      "var4.linkToDeath(this,0);",
      "IGsiService var8 = IGsiService$Stub.asInterface(var4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the identified sinks:

1. The first sink set involves accessing and modifying system properties related to GSI service using `getGsiService()`, `SystemProperties.get()`, and `SystemProperties.set()` methods. These instructions collectively contribute to a potential sink, as they involve sensitive operations on system properties.

2. The second sink set involves retrieving a binder object from the ServiceManager using `getService()`, linking it to death using `linkToDeath()`, and then converting it to an IGsiService interface using `IGsiService$Stub.asInterface()`. These instructions form another potential sink, as they involve accessing and manipulating system services.

Note that I've ranked these sinks based on their sensitivity and potential impact. The first sink set is considered more sensitive, as it involves modifying system properties, which can have broader implications on the system's behavior.
