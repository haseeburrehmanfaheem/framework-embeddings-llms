After analyzing the provided Java code for the `isSyncActive` API, I have identified several potential sinks. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean var21 = var17.isSyncActive(var18);", 
      "return var21;"
    ],
    [
      "List var6 = getCurrentSyncs(var4);",
      "Iterator var8 = var6.iterator();",
      "Object var13 = var8.next();",
      "SyncInfo var14 = (SyncInfo) var13;",
      "int var15 = var14.authorityId;"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayList var6 = new ArrayList();",
      "SparseArray var10 = this.mCurrentSyncs;",
      "var10.put(param2,var8);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation of the identified sinks:

1. The first sink is related to the `isSyncActive` method call on the `SyncStorageEngine` object, which seems to return a boolean value indicating whether sync is active or not. This value is then returned by the API.

2. The second sink involves retrieving a list of current syncs using the `getCurrentSyncs` method and iterating over it to retrieve a `SyncInfo` object. Although this does not directly contribute to a data flow, it seems that some sensitive information might be accessed or processed here.

3. The third sink is related to creating a new `ArrayList` and updating the `mCurrentSyncs` sparse array with this list. This could potentially store or modify sensitive synchronization-related data.

Note that these sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on security.
