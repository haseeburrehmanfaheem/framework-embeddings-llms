Based on the provided code for the `onClearAllNotifications` API, I have identified two sets of instructions that collectively contribute to potential sinks. Here is the JSON representation:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "NotificationDelegate var10 = this.mNotificationDelegate;",
      "var10.onClearAll(var5,var7,param2);"
    ],
    [
      "NotificationManagerService var7 = this.this$0;",
      "var7.cancelAllLocked(param2,param3,param4,3,0,1);",
      "NotificationManagerService$WorkerHandler var8 = this.mHandler;",
      "NotificationManagerService$15 var9 = new NotificationManagerService$15();",
      "boolean var12 = var8.post(var9);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink involves the `onClearAll` method invocation on the `NotificationDelegate` object, which has naming similarity with the API name and processes input parameters.

The second sink involves a series of instructions that lead to the cancellation of all notifications. The `cancelAllLocked` method is invoked on the `NotificationManagerService` object, which takes several input parameters. Additionally, a new `NotificationManagerService$15` object is created and posted using the `WorkerHandler`, which may also contribute to the sink.

Note that I have ranked the sinks based on their sensitivity, with the first sink involving the `onClearAll` method invocation potentially being more sensitive due to its direct handling of notification clearing. The second sink involves a series of internal operations related to notification cancellation and posting, which may be considered less sensitive but still important for security considerations.
