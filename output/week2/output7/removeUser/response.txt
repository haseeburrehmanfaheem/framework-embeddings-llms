Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "AppOpsService$ClientRestrictionState var14 = (AppOpsService$ClientRestrictionState) var13;",
      "var14.removeUser(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "SparseArray var3 = this.perUserExcludedPackages;",
      "var3.remove(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "SparseArray var10 = this.perUserRestrictions;",
      "var10.remove(param2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

The code has multiple instructions that contribute to sinks. 

1. The first sink is the removal of a user from `AppOpsService$ClientRestrictionState`. This instruction directly influences the state of the object, making it a potential sink.

2. The second sink is the removal of an item from the `perUserExcludedPackages` SparseArray using the `remove()` method and passing in `param2`. This instruction modifies the internal state of the SparseArray, which could have security implications.

3. The third sink is similar to the second one but for the `perUserRestrictions` SparseArray.

Note that some instructions were not considered as sinks because they do not directly influence the output or internal state in a way that would create a potential security risk (e.g., accessing an object's size, logging statements).
