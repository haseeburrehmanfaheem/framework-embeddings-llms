Here is the analysis of the provided code:

The API `setSplitScreenResizing` has several potential sinks that require access control. Here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var10.setSplitScreenResizing(param2);",
      "this.mDockedStackResizing = param2;",
      "var4.setDockedStackResizing(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "resizeDockedStackLocked(var8,var9,var10,var11,var12,1);",
      "resizeDockedStackLocked(param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,param7,0);"
    ],
    [
      "Rect var19 = Rect.copyOrNull(param2);",
      "this.mPendingDockedBounds = var19;",
      "Rect var21 = Rect.copyOrNull(param3);",
      "this.mPendingTempDockedTaskBounds = var21;",
      "Rect var23 = Rect.copyOrNull(param4);",
      "this.mPendingTempDockedTaskInsetBounds = var23;",
      "Rect var25 = Rect.copyOrNull(param5);",
      "this.mPendingTempOtherTaskBounds = var25;",
      "Rect var27 = Rect.copyOrNull(param6);",
      "this.mPendingTempOtherTaskInsetBounds = var27;"
    ],
    [
      "var15.resize(param2,param3,param4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink is the `setSplitScreenResizing` method call on the `ActivityStackSupervisor` object, which takes the input parameter `param2`. This is a potential sink because it has naming similarity with the API name and processes the input parameter.

2. The second sink is the `resizeDockedStackLocked` method calls, which take several input parameters (`var8`, `var9`, `var10`, etc.). These are potential sinks because they process the input parameters and have a direct dataflow link between them.

3. The third sink is the creation of new `Rect` objects using the `copyOrNull` method, which takes the input parameters `param2`, `param3`, `param4`, etc. as arguments. These are potential sinks because they create new objects with data flowing from the API parameters and have naming similarity to the API.

4. The fourth sink is the `resize` method call on the `ActivityStack` object, which takes several input parameters (`param2`, `param3`, `param4`). This is a potential sink because it processes the input parameters and has a direct dataflow link with the previous sinks.

Note that some instructions are not included in the identified sinks because they do not meet the criteria of having naming similarity with the API name, processing input parameters, or creating new objects with data flowing from the API parameters.
