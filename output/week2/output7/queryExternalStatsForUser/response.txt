After analyzing the provided Java code for the `queryExternalStatsForUser` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "[I var17 = getAppIds(param3);",
      "Installer var18 = this.mInstaller;",
      "int var20 = StorageStatsService.getDefaultFlags();",
      "[J var22 = var18.getExternalSize(param2,param3,var20,var17);",
      "ExternalStorageStats var54 = new ExternalStorageStats();",
      "56 = arrayload 22[24];",
      "var54.totalBytes = var56;",
      "58 = arrayload 22[57];",
      "var54.audioBytes = var58;",
      "60 = arrayload 22[59];",
      "var54.videoBytes = var60;",
      "62 = arrayload 22[61];",
      "var54.imageBytes = var62;",
      "64 = arrayload 22[63];",
      "var54.appBytes = var64;",
      "66 = arrayload 22[65];",
      "var54.obbBytes = var66;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

In this API, a single sink set is identified, which involves the creation of an `ExternalStorageStats` object (`var54`) and its properties being populated with data from various sources. The objects and methods involved in this sink have high naming similarity with the API name or are directly related to the input parameters.

Note that some variables and methods, such as `var6`, `var14`, `var26`, and `PackageManager var4`, are not included in the identified sinks because they do not meet the positive rules (e.g., logging, auxiliary operations, or generic utility methods).
