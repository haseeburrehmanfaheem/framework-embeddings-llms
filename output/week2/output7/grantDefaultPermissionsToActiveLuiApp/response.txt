Here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var9.grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp(param2,param3);",
      "Set var17 = new Set(1);",
      "Set var18 = CAMERA_PERMISSIONS;",
      "arraystore 17[19] = 18;",
      "grantSystemFixedPermissionsToSystemPackage(param2,param3,var17);"
    ],
    [
      "grantPermissionsToSystemPackage(param2,param3,1,param4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The sinks are identified based on the following reasoning:

* The first sink set is related to granting default permissions to the active LUI app. It includes:
	+ `var9.grantDefaultPermissionsToActiveLuiApp(param2,param3);`, which has naming similarity with the API name and processes the input parameters.
	+ Creating a new Set object (`Set var17 = new Set(1);`) and modifying it with camera permissions (`arraystore 17[19] = 18;`), propagating the API input parameters through to the object.
	+ `grantSystemFixedPermissionsToSystemPackage(param2,param3,var17);`, which is invoked with the modified Set object as an argument, indicating a data flow link between them.
* The second sink is related to granting permissions to a system package. It includes:
	+ `grantPermissionsToSystemPackage(param2,param3,1,param4);`, which has naming similarity with the API name and processes the input parameters.

These sinks follow at least one of the positive rules and are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on security and access control.
