Here is the analysis of the provided API code:

The `getCacheQuotaBytes` method does not return any value, but it contains several instructions that collectively contribute to potential sinks.

One sink is related to the invocation of `getCacheQuotaBytes` methods on different objects. The data flow between these invocations is as follows:

* `var20 = var18.getCacheQuotaBytes(param2,param3);`
* `long var9 = var4.getCacheQuotaBytes(param2,param3,var7);`

Both method invocations have a high naming similarity with the API name `getCacheQuotaBytes`, and they process input parameters `param2` and `param3`. These instructions contribute to a single sink.

Another potential sink is related to the creation of a new object:

* `StorageStatsManager var18 = (StorageStatsManager) var17;`

However, this object is not returned by the API or used with other sink cases. Therefore, it does not meet the positive rules and should be ignored.

Here is the JSON output containing the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "long var20 = var18.getCacheQuotaBytes(param2,param3);",
      "long var9 = var4.getCacheQuotaBytes(param2,param3,var7);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Note that the provided code seems to be incomplete or contains duplicate instructions. The analysis is based on the provided code snippet and may not reflect the actual behavior of the `getCacheQuotaBytes` method in the StorageManagerService_3 class.
