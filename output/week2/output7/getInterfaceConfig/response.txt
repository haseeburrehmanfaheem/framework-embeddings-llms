Based on the provided Java code for the `getInterfaceConfig` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "INetd var7 = this.mNetdService;",
      "InterfaceConfigurationParcel var9 = var7.interfaceGetCfg(param2);",
      "InterfaceConfiguration var14 = NetworkManagementService.fromStableParcel(var9);"
    ],
    [
      "String var4 = this.hwAddr;",
      "var2.setHardwareAddress(var4);"
    ],
    [
      "String var6 = this.ipv4Addr;",
      "InetAddress var8 = NetworkUtils.numericToInetAddress(var6);",
      "LinkAddress var9 = new LinkAddress();",
      "int var10 = this.prefixLength;",
      "var2.setLinkAddress(var9);"
    ],
    [
      "String var13 = this.flags;",
      "14 = arraylength 13;",
      "16 = arrayload 13[20];",
      "var2.setFlag(var16);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each sink:

1. The first sink involves invoking the `interfaceGetCfg` method on the `INetd` object, which is obtained from the `mNetdService` field. This method takes the `param2` input parameter and returns an `InterfaceConfigurationParcel` object. The output of this method directly influences the creation of an `InterfaceConfiguration` object.

2. The second sink involves setting the hardware address on an `InterfaceConfiguration` object using the `hwAddr` field.

3. The third sink involves creating a new `LinkAddress` object and setting its prefix length to the value obtained from the `prefixLength` field. This sink also uses the output of the `numericToInetAddress` method, which takes the `ipv4Addr` field as input.

4. The fourth sink involves setting a flag on an `InterfaceConfiguration` object using the `flags` field and an array load operation.

Note that these sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on system security.
