Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "AppOpsService$UidState var44 = new AppOpsService$UidState();",
        "SparseIntArray var46 = new SparseIntArray();",
        "var44.opModes = var46;",
        "SparseIntArray var48 = var44.opModes;",
        "var48.put(var12,param4);",
        "SparseArray var50 = this.mUidStates;",
        "var50.put(param3,var44);"
    ],
    [
        "Message var85 = PooledLambda.obtainMessage(var74,this,var36,var76,var79,var83);",
        "boolean var87 = var73.sendMessage(var85);"
    ]
]
}
```

The first sink is related to the creation of a new `AppOpsService$UidState` object and its associated data structures (`SparseIntArray`), which are then stored in the `mUidStates` sparse array. This sink has high naming similarity with the API name `setUidMode` and processes the input parameters `param2` and `param3`.

The second sink is related to sending a message using the `sendMessage` method of the `Handler` object, which is created using the `PooledLambda.obtainMessage` method. This sink has dataflow from the API parameters `var15`, `var77`, and `var83`, which are used to create the message.

Note that I have ranked these sinks based on their potential sensitivity, with the first sink being more sensitive due to its involvement in creating a new state object and storing it in a sparse array.
