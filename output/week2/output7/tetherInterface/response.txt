Here is the JSON with potential sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var7.tetherInterfaceAdd(param2);",
      "ArrayList var12 = new ArrayList();",
      "RouteInfo var14 = new RouteInfo();",
      "InterfaceConfiguration var16 = getInterfaceConfig(param2);",
      "LinkAddress var18 = var16.getLinkAddress();",
      "boolean var22 = var12.add(var14);",
      "addInterfaceToLocalNetwork(param2,var12);"
    ],
    [
      "modifyInterfaceInNetwork(1,99,param2);",
      "Iterator var8 = iterator();",
      "Object var13 = var8.next();",
      "RouteInfo var14 = (RouteInfo) var13;",
      "boolean var16 = var14.isDefaultRoute();",
      "modifyRoute(1,99,var14);"
    ],
    [
      "INetAddress var6 = InetAddress.getByAddress(var4);",
      "String var12 = var6.getHostAddress();"
    ],
    [
      "IpPrefix var12 = getDestination();",
      "String var14 = var12.toString();"
    ],
    [
      "InetAddress var23 = getGateway();",
      "String var25 = var23.getHostAddress();"
    ],
    [
      "var36.networkAddRoute(param3,var10,var14,var30);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here is the explanation of each sink:

1. The first sink is related to adding an interface to the local network. It includes method invocations `tetherInterfaceAdd`, `addInterfaceToLocalNetwork`, and object creations `ArrayList` and `RouteInfo`.

2. The second sink is related to modifying the route in the network. It includes method invocations `modifyInterfaceInNetwork`, `iterator`, `next`, `isDefaultRoute`, and `modifyRoute`.

3. The third sink is related to getting the host address of an InetAddress object.

4. The fourth sink is related to converting an IpPrefix object to a string.

5. The fifth sink is related to getting the gateway InetAddress object and its host address.

6. The sixth sink is related to adding a route to the network using `networkAddRoute` method invocation.
