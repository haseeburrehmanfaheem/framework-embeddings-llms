Based on the provided code for the `updateSystemUpdateInfo` API, I've identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the relevant code:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "saveSystemUpdateInfoLocked(param2,var12);",
      "PersistableBundle var4 = new PersistableBundle();",
      "var4.putPersistableBundle(info-bundle,param2);",
      "var4.putInt(version,0);",
      "var4.putInt(uid,param3);",
      "int var14 = getBootCount();",
      "var4.putInt(boot-count,var14);",
      "boolean var18 = writeInfoFileLocked(var4);"
    ],
    [
      "FastXmlSerializer var8 = new FastXmlSerializer();",
      "Charset var10 = UTF_8;",
      "String var12 = var10.name();",
      "var8.setOutput(var7,var12);",
      "Boolean var16 = Boolean.valueOf(1);",
      "var8.startDocument(0,var16);",
      "XmlSerializer var19 = var8.startTag(0,info);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink set includes the `saveSystemUpdateInfoLocked` method invocation, which has high naming similarity with the API name and processes the input parameters. The creation of a new `PersistableBundle` object and its subsequent modifications using the input parameters also contribute to this sink.

The second sink set includes the creation of a new `FastXmlSerializer` object and its usage to write data to a file, which has high naming similarity with the API name. The `startDocument` and `startTag` method invocations also contribute to this sink.

Both sinks follow at least one of the positive rules: having naming similarity with the API name, processing input parameters, or creating new objects with data flows from the API parameters.
