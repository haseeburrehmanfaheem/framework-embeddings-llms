Based on the provided code, I have identified two potential sink sets that follow at least one of the positive rules.

Here is the JSON output:
```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "String var9 = AppOpsService.resolvePackageName(param4,param5);", 
        "AppOpsService$Op var15 = getOpLocked(param3,param4,var9,1,1,0);",
        "ApplicationInfo var28 = var23.getApplicationInfo(param3,786432,var26);"
    ],
    [
        "ArrayMap var11 = new ArrayMap();", 
        "var8.pkgOps = var11;"
    ]
]
}
```
Here's a breakdown of the identified sink sets:

**Sink Set 1:**
This set involves the resolution of package names and retrieval of application information. The code flows as follows:
- `resolvePackageName` is called with parameters `param4` and `param5`, which are used to resolve the package name.
- The resolved package name is then passed to `getOpLocked` along with other parameters, which returns an instance of `AppOpsService$Op`.
- The application information is retrieved using `getApplicationInfo` from the package manager.

**Sink Set 2:**
This set involves the creation and assignment of a new `ArrayMap`. The code flows as follows:
- A new `ArrayMap` instance is created.
- This new map is then assigned to the `pkgOps` field of an `AppOpsService$UidState` object, effectively replacing its previous value.

Note that there are repeated blocks of code in the original API, but I have only included each block once in the sink sets.
