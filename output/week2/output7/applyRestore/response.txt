After analyzing the provided Java code for the `applyRestore` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the result in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "SlicePermissionManager var22 = this.mPermissions;",
      "var22.readRestore(var17);"
    ],
    [
      "XmlPullParser var17 = var15.newPullParser();",
      "var17.setInput(var12,var20);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the identified sinks:

1. The first sink involves the `SlicePermissionManager` object, which is used to read restore data from an XML parser. This method call has naming similarity with the API name `applyRestore`, and it processes the input parameters indirectly through the `XmlPullParser` object.

2. The second sink involves creating a new `XmlPullParser` object and setting its input using the `setInput` method. Although this does not directly process sensitive data, it is part of the overall data flow that leads to the first sink.

Both sinks have a clear dataflow link between them, as the output of the XML parser setup (second sink) directly influences the input of the permission manager's restore method (first sink).

Note that some instructions in the original code are not included in the identified sinks because they do not contribute to the overall data flow or do not follow at least one of the positive rules.
