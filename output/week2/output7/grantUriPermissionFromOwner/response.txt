Based on the provided code, here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UriPermission var23 = findOrCreateUriPermission(var21,param3,param2,param4);",
      "var23.grantModes(param5,param6);"
    ],
    [
      "GrantUri var61 = new GrantUri();",
      "grantUriPermission(param3,param4,var61,param6,var21,var18);"
    ],
    [
      "SparseArray var13 = this.mGrantedUriPermissions;",
      "var13.put(param4,var12);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first set of sinks (`findOrCreateUriPermission` and `grantModes`) is related to granting URI permissions to a specific package. This is a sensitive operation, as it involves modifying the permission state of a package.

2. The second set of sinks (`new GrantUri` and `grantUriPermission`) is also related to granting URI permissions. In this case, a new `GrantUri` object is created and then passed to the `grantUriPermission` method along with other parameters. This operation involves modifying the permission state of a package.

3. The third set of sinks (`SparseArray` and `put`) is related to updating the internal data structure that stores granted URI permissions. While this operation may not be directly related to granting permissions, it does involve updating sensitive data that could potentially be used in a malicious way.

All three sets of sinks are ranked as high-sensitivity because they involve modifying or updating sensitive permission states.
