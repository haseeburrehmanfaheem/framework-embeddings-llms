Here is the JSON with potential sinks for the getDefaultBrowserPackageName API:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "PackageManagerInternal$DefaultBrowserProvider var16 = this.mDefaultBrowserProvider;",
      "String var20 = var16.getDefaultBrowser(param2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The getDefaultBrowser method is invoked on the mDefaultBrowserProvider object. This method call follows one of the positive rules as it has a naming similarity with the API name getDefaultBrowserPackageName.
- The return value of getDefaultBrowser (var20) is used within the API, but its usage is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context and variable names, it can be inferred that var20 might be returned by the API or used to construct a sensitive object/data.

Note: It's essential to review more code or documentation for this API to determine the exact data flow and potential sinks accurately.
