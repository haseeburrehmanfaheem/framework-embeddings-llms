After carefully examining the code of the `getAllocatableBytes` API, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "int var6 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
        "String var17 = AppOpsService.resolvePackageName(param3,param4);"
    ],
    [
        "Object var20 = var17.getSystemService(var18);",
        "AppOpsManager var21 = (AppOpsManager) var20;",
        "boolean var26 = var21.isOperationActive(26,param3,param4);"
    ],
    [
        "IAppOpsService var5 = this.mService;",
        "boolean var7 = var5.isOperationActive(param2,param3,param4);"
    ],
    [
        "ArrayMap var18 = this.mClients;",
        "Object var25 = var23.valueAt(var45);",
        "AppOpsService$ClientState var26 = (AppOpsService$ClientState) var25;"
    ],
    [
        "ArrayList var27 = var26.mStartedOps;",
        "Object var33 = var31.get(var41);",
        "AppOpsService$Op var34 = (AppOpsService$Op) var33;"
    ]
]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

1. The first sink involves retrieving the calling UID using `Binder.getCallingUid()` and resolving the package name using `AppOpsService.resolvePackageName()`. This could potentially leak sensitive information about the caller.
2. The second sink involves getting an instance of `AppOpsManager` using `var17.getSystemService(var18)` and checking if a specific operation is active using `isOperationActive()`. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to app operations.
3. The third sink involves accessing the `IAppOpsService` instance using `this.mService` and checking if an operation is active using `isOperationActive()`. This could also potentially allow unauthorized access to app operations.
4. The fourth sink involves accessing the `ArrayMap` of clients using `this.mClients` and retrieving a client state object using `var23.valueAt(var45)`. This could potentially leak sensitive information about registered clients.
5. The fifth sink involves accessing the `ArrayList` of started ops using `var26.mStartedOps` and retrieving an op object using `var31.get(var41)`. This could also potentially leak sensitive information about ongoing operations.

Note that these sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on system security.
