      "Map var42 = getRequestingPackages(param2,param6);",
      "HashSet var4 = new HashSet();",
      "Integer var42 = resolveAccountVisibility(param2,var40,param3);"
    ],
    [
      "int var51 = getAccountVisibilityFromCache(param2,param3,param4);",
      "int var83 = getAccountVisibilityFromCache(param2,android:accounts:key_legacy_not_visible,param4);",
      "int var93 = getAccountVisibilityFromCache(param2,android:accounts:key_legacy_visible,param4);"
    ],
    [
      "boolean var17 = isAccountManagedByCaller(var15,var12,var14);",
      "boolean var41 = UserHandle.isSameApp(var15,1000);",

}
```

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The first sink array contains instructions that are directly related to setting account visibility and resolving package requests. These instructions have high naming similarity with the API name `setAccountVisibility` and process the input parameters `param2`, `param3`, and `param4`.

2. The second sink array includes instructions that retrieve account visibility from cache, which is also closely related to the API's purpose of setting account visibility. These instructions follow the positive rule of having naming similarity with the API name.

3. The third sink array consists of instructions that perform checks on account management and application type. Although these instructions do not directly contribute to setting account visibility, they are still relevant to the API's functionality and follow the positive rules.

Note that I excluded generic utility methods (e.g., `Preconditions.checkNotNull`, `toString`), logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, and auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining instance of a class, accessing context objects) as per the negative rules.
