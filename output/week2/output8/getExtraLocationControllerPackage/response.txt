Based on the provided API code, here is the JSON output with identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "String var3 = this.mExtraLocationControllerPackage;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The instruction `String var3 = this.mExtraLocationControllerPackage;` follows one of the positive rules because it has naming similarity with the API name `getExtraLocationControllerPackage`.
- Although `Object var2 = this.mLock;` is an auxiliary operation (obtaining a lock), it does not directly contribute to any data flow related to the API's purpose or parameters, thus it doesn't follow any of the positive rules for being considered a sink in this context.
- The variable `var3` is assigned the value of `mExtraLocationControllerPackage`, which suggests that the field access could potentially reveal sensitive information about the location controller package. However, without additional context on how `mExtraLocationControllerPackage` is used or its sensitivity, we identify it based on the naming similarity rule.
- There's no method invocation, object creation with API parameters, or other field modifications that would indicate a sink according to the provided positive rules in this simplified code snippet.
- Given there are no other instructions that collectively contribute to another sink and considering the simplicity of the provided code, we only list one set of sinks.
