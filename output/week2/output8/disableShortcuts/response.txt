The provided API `disableShortcuts` is analyzed to identify potential sinks that require access control. The identified sinks follow at least one of the positive rules and are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive.

1. **Sink Set 1:**
   - This sink set involves invoking the method `getPackageShortcutsForPublisherLocked` with parameters `param2` and `param6`, which takes input parameters as arguments.
   - The returned value is then used to invoke another method `ensureImmutableShortcutsNotIncludedWithIds` on the `var14` object, passing in `param3`. This shows a clear data flow from one instruction to the next.

2. **Sink Set 2:**
   - This sink set involves getting user shortcuts locked with `param3`, then retrieving package shortcuts for `param2`.
   - The returned `ShortcutUser` object is used to call `onCalledByPublisher` with `param2`, indicating a data flow from the initial method invocation through to the final method call.

Note that other instructions in the code, such as logging and checking for empty strings or null objects, are considered auxiliary operations or logging methods according to the negative rules provided. Therefore, they are not included as sinks in this analysis.
