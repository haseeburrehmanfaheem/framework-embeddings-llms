}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink set includes instructions related to getting and restoring the calling identity, which has high sensitivity due to its potential impact on access control. The `Binder.getCallingUid()` method invocation returns a sensitive piece of information (the UID of the calling process), making it a potential sink according to the positive rules.

2. The second sink set involves accessing and updating a user state object (`TvInputManagerService$UserState var52`) based on the input parameters `param3` and `param2`. This is considered a sink because it follows one of the positive rules, specifically modifying fields with API parameters. 

These two sinks are ranked in order of sensitivity, with the first set being more sensitive due to its direct relation to access control mechanisms (UID handling).
