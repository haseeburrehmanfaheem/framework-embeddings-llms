  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var15 = var11.getShortcutIconResId(var13,param2,param3,param4,param5);"
    ]
  ]
}
```
In the provided code snippet for `getShortcutIconResId`, there's only one potential sink identified based on the given rules:

1. The method invocation `var11.getShortcutIconResId(var13, param2, param3, param4, param5)` is considered a sink because it:
   - Has naming similarity with the API name (`getShortcutIconResId`).
   - Takes input parameters as arguments (`param2`, `param3`, `param4`, `param5`) and processes them along with `var13`, which is derived from `getCallingUserId()`.
   
The variable `var11` is an auxiliary operation (obtaining an instance of a class or accessing context objects), so it's not considered a sink on its own. Similarly, `int var15;` without any assignment or further use does not contribute to a data flow that would classify it as part of a sink under the given rules.

Given there is only one identified set of instructions contributing to a potential sink, ranking from most sensitive to least sensitive isn't applicable in this case.
