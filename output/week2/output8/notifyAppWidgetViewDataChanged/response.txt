In the `notifyAppWidgetViewDataChanged` API, I have identified three potential sink sets:

1. The first set involves the method invocation of `lookupWidgetLocked`, which takes the input parameters as arguments and returns a sensitive widget object that is later used in `scheduleNotifyAppWidgetViewDataChanged`. This follows the positive rule for method invocations.

2. The second set includes the creation of an atomic long variable, incrementing its value, and then using this value to update a sparse long array. Although it does not directly involve input parameters or naming similarity with the API name, it updates internal state that might be sensitive in certain contexts, thus following one of the positive rules related to object creation or modification.

3. The third set involves creating a new `SomeArgs` object and populating its fields with data from other variables (including ones derived from input parameters) before passing it to a handler for further processing. This follows the rule regarding the creation of new objects, especially since these objects are used in subsequent operations that could potentially impact security or privacy.

Each set represents a coherent sequence of instructions where outputs directly influence inputs or creations in subsequent steps, thus linking them as sinks. The ranking from most sensitive to least sensitive considers the direct handling of input parameters and the potential for affecting external state or behavior through method calls and object creation.
