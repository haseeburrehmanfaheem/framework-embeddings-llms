```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "IVold var7 = this.mVold;",
      "var7.createUserKey(param2,param3,param4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The provided API `createUserKey` has a clear dataflow link between the instructions. The `IVold` object `var7` is created and then used to invoke the `createUserKey` method, passing `param2`, `param3`, and `param4` as arguments. This meets at least one of the positive rules: the method invocation has naming similarity with the API name (`createUserKey`) and takes input parameters as arguments.
