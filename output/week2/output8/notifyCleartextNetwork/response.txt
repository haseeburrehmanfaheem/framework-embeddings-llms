```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ActivityManagerService$MainHandler var4 = this.mHandler;",
      "Message var8 = var4.obtainMessage(49,param2,0,param3);",
      "var8.sendToTarget();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

In the provided API `notifyCleartextNetwork`, a new `Message` object is created using the `obtainMessage` method of the `MainHandler`. The message is then sent to its target. 

The instructions form a coherent set because:
1. `var4` (the handler) is used to obtain a new `Message` (`var8`), establishing a dataflow link.
2. The obtained `Message` (`var8`) is then sent, potentially propagating the parameters (`param2`, `param3`) passed during its creation.

These instructions follow at least one of the positive rules:
- They have naming similarity with the API name due to being part of the method's internal logic.
- The created object and its subsequent operation are directly influenced by the method's execution flow, which is a key aspect in identifying potential sinks. 

However, note that `param2` and `param3` are not defined within this snippet, suggesting they might be fields or parameters passed from an outer scope, but their exact nature isn't specified here. The instructions as presented still form a coherent set based on the information given.
