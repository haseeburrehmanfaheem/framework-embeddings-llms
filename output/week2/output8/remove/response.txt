```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "IGsiService var3 = getGsiService();",
      "String var5 = SystemProperties.get(init.svc.gsid);",
      "boolean var8 = equals(var5);"
    ],
    [
      "SystemProperties.set(ctl.start,gsid);"
    ],
    [
      "IBinder var4 = ServiceManager.getService(gsiservice);",

However, upon closer inspection of the provided code and considering the rules for identifying sinks in an Android API, it becomes apparent that some instructions are repeated and seem to be incorrectly formatted or possibly obfuscated. The main issue lies in understanding what directly contributes to a sink based on the positive rules (naming similarity with the API name, processing input parameters, returning values by the API) and excluding generic utility methods, logging, and auxiliary operations.

Given this context, a more refined analysis focusing strictly on the original code's logic without obfuscation or repetition would be:

1. **Method Invocations**: The `getGsiService()` method has naming similarity with the service name but not directly with the API name "remove". However, it does process internal state and returns a value that could influence subsequent operations.
   
2. **Field Access/Updates**: The code involves accessing system properties (`SystemProperties.get(init.svc.gsid)`) and updating them (`SystemProperties.set(ctl.start,gsid)`), which directly relate to the service's operation but not necessarily as sinks in the context of the "remove" API unless they are considered critical for the removal process.

3. **Object Creation**: The creation of `IGsiService$Stub$Proxy` objects and interaction with binder services (`IBinder var4 = ServiceManager.getService(gsiservice);`) could be relevant if these operations directly influence the outcome of the "remove" operation or handle sensitive data.

Considering the positive rules for identifying sinks:
- **Method Invocations**: 
  - `getGsiService()` has naming similarity and is involved in service management.
  - `equals(var5)` processes input parameters but its relevance depends on its role in the removal process.
- **Field Get/Set Cases**:
  - Accessing (`SystemProperties.get(init.svc.gsid)`) and updating system properties (`SystemProperties.set(ctl.start,gsid)`) could be critical for service management.
- **Object Creation**: 
  - Creating `IGsiService$Stub$Proxy` objects might be relevant if these are directly used in the removal process.

Given the provided code's structure and focusing on direct contributions to potential sinks without repetition:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "IGsiService var3 = getGsiService();",
      "String var5 = SystemProperties.get(init.svc.gsid);"
    ],
    [
      "SystemProperties.set(ctl.start,gsid);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This analysis focuses on the core logic of method invocations and system property access/modification that could directly contribute to the operation of the "remove" API. However, without a clear understanding of how these operations are used in the context of removing services or handling sensitive data, the identification of sinks might need further refinement based on the specific requirements and sensitivities of the DynamicSystemService_1 service.
