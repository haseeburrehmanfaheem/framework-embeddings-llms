Here is the JSON output for the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var10 = var8.getDisabledShowContextLocked(var5);",
      "this.mDisabledShowContext = var10;" 
    ]
  ]
}
```
However, in your original prompt you did not include `this.mDisabledShowContext = var10;`. Based on the positive rules provided and assuming that `var24` should be assigned a value from the method call for it to make sense as part of the data flow:

Here is an updated response based on your code:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var5 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
      "int var10 = var8.getDisabledShowContextLocked(var5);"
    ]
  ]
}
```
Note that `var24` seems to be the variable assigned with the value of `this.mDisabledShowContext`, but in your code snippet, it does not seem like the result from `getDisabledShowContextLocked` is being used. Therefore, I've only included instructions where there's a clear data flow and at least one positive rule applies.

If you meant for `var24` to hold the value of `var10`, then that would indeed create a sink set with `this.mDisabledShowContext = var10;`. But as per your provided code, this does not happen. Hence I did not include it in my final response.
