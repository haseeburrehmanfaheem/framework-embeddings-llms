} 

Note that the API `getAutoPersisting` does not explicitly return a value in the provided code. However, based on the method name and the fact that it invokes another method with similar naming (`getAutoPersisting()`), we can infer that `var6 = var4.getAutoPersisting();` is likely to be part of a sink.

The instruction `boolean var6 = var4.getAutoPersisting();` follows one of the positive rules: it has naming similarity with the API name (`getAutoPersisting`). However, without an explicit return statement or further usage of `var6`, we cannot establish a clear dataflow link to other instructions. The code snippet seems incomplete regarding the handling of the result from `getAutoPersisting()`. 

Given this context and the rules provided, there's only one identified potential sink related to method invocation with naming similarity to the API name.
