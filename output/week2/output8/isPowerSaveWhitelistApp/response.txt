        "boolean var5 = var3.containsKey(param2);"

However, note that the provided code does not show any return statement or further usage of `var5`, which makes it difficult to determine if `var3.isPowerSaveWhitelistAppInternal(param2)` is indeed a sink. 

Assuming that `var5` will be returned or used in some way (not shown in this snippet), we can consider the first block as a potential sink because `isPowerSaveWhitelistAppInternal` has high naming similarity with the API name and processes the input parameter `param2`.

The second and third blocks are also considered as sinks, but they seem less sensitive compared to the first one. They access fields (`mPowerSaveWhitelistApps`, `mPowerSaveWhitelistUserApps`) that have some relation to the API's purpose (checking if an app is power save whitelisted), which meets at least one of the positive rules.

Also note that `param2` should be a valid input parameter for this method. The provided code snippet seems incomplete as it doesn't show how `param2` is defined or passed to this method. If `param2` is not an actual input parameter, but rather some internal variable, then the analysis might need to be adjusted accordingly. 

Lastly, remember that the ranking of sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive can vary based on specific requirements and context. This answer provides a general assessment based on the given information.
