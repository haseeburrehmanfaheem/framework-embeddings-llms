```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "BatteryStatsImpl var4 = this.mStats;",
        "var5.noteFullWifiLockAcquiredFromSourceLocked(param2);"
    ],
    [
        "var5.noteFullWifiLockAcquiredFromSourceLocked(param2);"
    ]
]
}
```

However, it's worth noting that there are a few issues with the provided code:

1. The method `noteFullWifiLockAcquiredFromSource` does not seem to be using any parameters, but `param2` is being used inside the method.
2. There is a duplicate call to `var5.noteFullWifiLockAcquiredFromSourceLocked(param2);`, which seems unnecessary.

Also, considering the provided code and rules for identifying sinks, we can see that:

* The field access `this.mStats` has naming similarity with the API name `noteFullWifiLockAcquiredFromSource`.
* The method invocation `var5.noteFullWifiLockAcquiredFromSourceLocked(param2);` also has naming similarity with the API name.

However, since there is no clear data flow link between these instructions and they are essentially performing the same operation, it might be more accurate to represent them as a single sink:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "BatteryStatsImpl var4 = this.mStats;",
        "var5.noteFullWifiLockAcquiredFromSourceLocked(param2);"
    ]
]
}
```

This representation groups the instructions that contribute to the same operation, eliminating redundancy.
