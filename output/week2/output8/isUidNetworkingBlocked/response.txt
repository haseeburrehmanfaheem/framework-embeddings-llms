```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var15 = var12.get(param2,0);",
      "boolean var16 = this.mRestrictBackground;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the explanation:

- `var7` and `var11` are auxiliary operations (obtaining context objects or locks), so they don't follow any positive rules.
- `var12.get(param2,0)` is a potential sink because it accesses a field (`mUidRules`) with an API parameter (`param2`). This instruction directly influences the output of the API, making it relevant to data flow and access control analysis. 
- `this.mRestrictBackground` is also a potential sink due to having naming similarity with no clear evidence but as it's being used in the method so might have some impact.
Both instructions are part of the same coherent set because they're related to accessing fields within the API, which may influence its output or behavior.
