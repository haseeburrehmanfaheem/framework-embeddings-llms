{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "SparseIntArray var8 = this.mUidPolicy;",
        "int var11 = var8.get(param2,0);"
    ]
]
}
```
Explanation: 

In the given API `getUidPolicy`, there are two potential instructions that could contribute to a sink. The first instruction is the field access of `mUidPolicy` which has naming similarity with the API name `getUidPolicy`. The second instruction is where this accessed field `mUidPolicy` is used to get an integer value using the input parameter `param2`.

The variable `var3` and `var7` are auxiliary operations, thus not considered as potential sinks according to the negative rules. 

Hence, we have identified one set of instructions that together form a sink with a clear dataflow link between them. The output of `mUidPolicy` directly influences the input or creation of `int var11`.
