```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "int var3 = this.mMuteAffectedStreams;",
        "var5 = 1 SHL param2;",
        "var6 = var3 and var5;"
    ]
]
}
```

Explanation:
- `int var3 = this.mMuteAffectedStreams;` has naming similarity with the API name, as it accesses a field (`mMuteAffectedStreams`) that could be related to the mute state of streams. 
- `var5 = 1 SHL param2;` directly uses an input parameter (`param2`), which makes it relevant.
- `var6 = var3 and var5;` takes the result from `var3` (which has naming similarity with the API) and combines it with `var5` (created using a parameter), linking these operations together as they process information related to stream mute state.

These instructions are directly linked in their processing of the stream mute state, influenced by both an internal field (`mMuteAffectedStreams`) and an input parameter (`param2`). The variable `var8` is not included because its assignment or usage is not provided in the given code snippet.
