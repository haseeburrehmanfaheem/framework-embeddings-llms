```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "boolean var10 = var8.supportsCheckpoint();",
        "return;" // implicit return as the method is void, no actual instruction but var10 could be used elsewhere in a real scenario
    ]
]
}
```
However, considering that `supportsCheckpoint()` does not directly return or use any parameters of the API and only an inner method with similar naming convention is invoked, we can assume it's still related due to naming similarity. 

A more accurate response would consider that there are no actual sinks in this case as per the provided positive rules since var10 isn't returned or used by other potential sink cases, thus no data flow to a sink. Hence:

```json
{
"Sinks": []
}
```
This reflects the fact that `supportsCheckpoint()` doesn't contain any instructions that directly contribute to a sink based on the given criteria, as it does not return anything and its local variable is not used in a way that would qualify it as part of a data flow leading to a potential sink.
