Based on the provided code, I've analyzed it to identify potential sinks. Here's my analysis:

The API `getSupportedTypes` appears to be retrieving a list of supported types and then creating an integer array based on the size of that list.

Here are the potential sinks identified in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "List var6 = HdmiControlService.access$1000(var4);",
            "int var8 = var6.size();",
            "[I var9 = new [I(var8);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

The identified sink set includes the following instructions:

1. `List var6 = HdmiControlService.access$1000(var4);` - This instruction accesses a field with naming similarity to the API name (`HdmiControlService`) and returns a list that is used in subsequent instructions.
2. `int var8 = var6.size();` - This instruction uses the size of the list returned by the previous instruction, creating a data flow link between them.
3. `[I var9 = new [I(var8);` - This instruction creates an integer array using the size calculated from the list's size in the previous instruction, further propagating the data flow.

These instructions together form a coherent set of sinks with a clear data flow link between them. The output of one instruction directly influences the input or creation of the next. 

Note that `HdmiControlService var2 = this.this$0;` and `HdmiControlService var4 = this.this$0;` are auxiliary operations, obtaining an instance of a class, and do not contribute to the identified sink set.

Also note that there is only one sink set in this case. If there were multiple sink sets with different data flow links between instructions, they would be separated into different arrays within the "Sinks" list and ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact.
