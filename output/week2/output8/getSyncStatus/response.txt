In the given code, there are two sets of instructions that form potential sinks. 

1. The first set includes `int var6 = UserHandle.getCallingUserId();` and `SyncStatusInfo var8 = getSyncStatusAsUser(param2,param3,param4,var6);`. This set forms a sink because it uses the input parameter `var6` (which is obtained from `UserHandle.getCallingUserId()`) to invoke the method `getSyncStatusAsUser`, which returns a sensitive object of type `SyncStatusInfo`.

2. The second set includes `SyncManager var29 = getSyncManager();`, `SyncStorageEngine$EndPoint var33 = new SyncStorageEngine$EndPoint();`, `SyncStorageEngine var36 = var29.getSyncStorageEngine();`, and `SyncStatusInfo var38 = var36.getStatusByAuthority(var33);`. This set forms a sink because it creates a new object of type `SyncStorageEngine$EndPoint` (which has naming similarity with the service name), uses this object to invoke the method `getStatusByAuthority`, which returns a sensitive object of type `SyncStatusInfo`.

Note that other instructions in the code, such as logging or auxiliary operations, do not form part of these sinks. The ranking is based on the sensitivity of the data being accessed and returned by each set of instructions.
