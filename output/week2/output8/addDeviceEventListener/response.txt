```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "HdmiControlService var3 = this.this$0;",
        "HdmiControlService var5 = this.this$0;",
        "HdmiControlService.access$3600(var5,param2);"
    ]
]
}
```
Note that `HdmiControlService.access$3600(var5,param2)` seems to be the primary sink as it's directly interacting with the input parameters (`param2`), but without more context about what this method does and how it uses `param2`, we cannot determine its sensitivity. However, based on the given code and rules:

- It has naming similarity with no API name mentioned in the code, but considering `addDeviceEventListener` as our reference point.
- The field access and update seem to be related to internal state rather than direct return values or object creations.
- There is a data flow from `param2`, which suggests it might follow one of the positive rules for sinks.

Given the lack of explicit information about what `HdmiControlService.access$3600(var5,param2)` does, we treat it as potentially sensitive because it involves an internal method invocation with input parameters. 

This code seems to have auxiliary operations (`var3` and `var5`) that are not directly used in a way that would classify them as sinks based on the provided rules. They seem more related to accessing context or class instances rather than direct contributors to potential sinks.
