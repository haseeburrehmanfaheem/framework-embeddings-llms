After carefully examining the provided code for the `clearApplicationUserData` API, I have identified several potential sinks based on the positive rules outlined. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "PackageSetting var17 = var15.getPackageLPr(param2);",
      "boolean var19 = filterAppAccessLPr(var17,var10,param4);"
    ],
    [
      "PermissionManagerServiceInternal var11 = this.mPermissionManager;",
      "Settings var15 = this.mSettings;"
    ],
    [
      "InstantAppRegistry var28 = this.mInstantAppRegistry;",
      "int var30 = UserHandle.getAppId(var14);",
      "int var31 = param2.appId;",
      "boolean var33 = var28.isInstantAccessGranted(param6,var30,var31);"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayMap var40 = this.mInstrumentation;",
      "Object var42 = var40.get(param4);",
      "PackageParser$Instrumentation var43 = (PackageParser$Instrumentation) var42;",
      "InstrumentationInfo var44 = var43.info;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
1. The first sink involves the `getPackageLPr` method, which retrieves a package setting based on the input parameter `param2`. This value is then used in the `filterAppAccessLPr` method, indicating that the output of one instruction directly influences the input or creation of the next.
2. The second sink includes accessing fields related to permission management and settings, but these do not directly interact with the API parameters or other identified sinks. They are ranked lower due to less direct influence on data flow within the API's execution.
3. The third sink involves the `InstantAppRegistry` and its interaction with input parameters (`var14`, `param2.appId`) to determine instant access grants. This series of instructions directly relates to the processing and decision-making based on API inputs, making it a significant sink.
4. The fourth sink concerns the retrieval of instrumentation information from an array map using `param4` as a key. This set of instructions follows the data flow from input parameters through object creation and field access, adhering to the positive rules for identifying sinks.

Note: Some parts of the code seem repetitive or have typos (e.g., `boolean 0<PATH_SEP>Context var5 = this.mContext;`), which were disregarded in favor of focusing on coherent sequences that adhere to the provided rules.
