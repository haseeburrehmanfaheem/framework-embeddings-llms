Based on the provided Java code for the `applyTunnelModeTransform` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "IpSecService$UserRecord var12 = var10.getUserRecord(var9);",
      "IpSecService$RefcountedResourceArray var13 = var12.mTransformRecords;",
      "IpSecService$IResource var15 = var13.getResourceOrThrow(param4);",
      "IpSecService$TransformRecord var16 = (IpSecService$TransformRecord) var15;",
      "var22.setXfrmInterfaceId(var58);"
    ],
    [
      "IpSecService$RefcountedResourceArray var17 = var12.mTunnelInterfaceRecords;",
      "IpSecService$IResource var19 = var17.getResourceOrThrow(param2);",
      "IpSecService$TunnelInterfaceRecord var20 = (IpSecService$TunnelInterfaceRecord) var19;",
      "int var58 = var20.getIfId();"
    ],
    [
      "IpSecConfig var22 = var16.getConfig();",
      "var22.setNetwork(var64);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

These sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on the system. The first sink is considered the most sensitive as it involves accessing and modifying user records, which could potentially lead to security breaches or data leaks.

Here's a brief explanation of each identified sink:

1. The first sink involves accessing and modifying user records (`var12`, `var13`, `var15`, `var16`) and setting the xfrm interface ID (`var22.setXfrmInterfaceId(var58)`). This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate user data or gain unauthorized access.
2. The second sink involves accessing tunnel interface records (`var17`, `var19`, `var20`) and retrieving the if ID (`int var58 = var20.getIfId()`). While this may not be as sensitive as the first sink, it could still potentially allow an attacker to gather information about the system's network configuration.
3. The third sink involves accessing and modifying IPsec configurations (`var22`, `var64`). This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the system's security settings or intercept sensitive data.

Note that these sinks are identified based on the provided code and may not be exhaustive. Additional analysis may be necessary to identify all potential sinks in the `applyTunnelModeTransform` API.
