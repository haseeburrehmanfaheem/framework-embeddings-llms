```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "BatteryStatsImpl var3 = this.mStats;",
        "BatteryStatsImpl var4 = this.mStats;",
        "var4.noteWifiOnLocked();",
        "var4.noteWifiOnLocked();"
    ]
]
}
```

However, the last `noteWifiOnLocked()` call seems redundant as it's inside an empty block and doesn't affect the data flow. Also, considering the positive rules provided for identifying sinks:

- The method `noteWifiOnLocked()` has naming similarity with the API name `noteWifiOn`.
- The method is invoked on an object that is accessed through a field of the class (`this.mStats`), which could be related to the API's purpose.

So, focusing on data flow and relevance to the API's functionality:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "BatteryStatsImpl var4 = this.mStats;",
        "var4.noteWifiOnLocked();"
    ]
]
}
```

In this case, `var3` seems unused and doesn't contribute to any sink directly related to data flow or API parameters. The actual sink is the invocation of `noteWifiOnLocked()` on `var4`, which is derived from `this.mStats`.
