  "Sinks": [
    [

```
In this API `isQuotaSupported`, the method invocations `var4.isQuotaSupported(param2)` and `var6.isQuotaSupported(param2)` are identified as potential sinks. These methods have high naming similarity with the API name `isQuotaSupported` and process the input parameter `param2`. The output of these method invocations directly influences the creation or assignment of variables within the API, thereby forming a coherent set of instructions that together contribute to a sink.

The other instructions in the code snippet are either auxiliary operations (e.g., accessing context objects like `this.mInstaller` and `this.mInstalld`) or logging/input validation is not present but checkBeforeRemote could be considered as an input validation/sanity checks hence it is not included in the sink. 

Note that since there is no direct data propagation between other instructions, they are not included in the sink set. The provided JSON includes only one array in 'Sinks' representing a coherent set of instructions with a clear dataflow link between them.
