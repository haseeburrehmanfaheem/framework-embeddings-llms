```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean var3 = AudioSystem.getMasterMute();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Note: There seems to be a mistake in the provided code, where `var3` is declared twice. For the purpose of analyzing potential sinks, we focus on the method invocation and its relation to the API name. In this case, `AudioSystem.getMasterMute()` has naming similarity with the API `isMasterMute`, indicating it as a potential sink. However, since `getMasterMute` returns a value that is not explicitly returned by the `isMasterMute` method (due to its void return type), further context or corrected code would be needed for a more accurate analysis. The provided JSON reflects the direct relation between the API and the invoked method based on naming similarity, one of the positive rules.
