}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink array represents the instructions that contribute to the removal of mixes for a policy. 
   - `int var7 = AudioSystem.registerPolicyMixes(var4,0);` is included because it has naming similarity with the API name and processes data from `var4`, which is related to the audio policies.
   - `ArrayList var11 = getMixes();` is included as it retrieves a list of mixes that will be processed by the next instruction.
   - `int var13 = var7.removeMixes(var11);` is included because it uses the output from `var7` and processes the list of mixes retrieved earlier.

2. The second sink array represents the instructions that contribute to the removal of a specific audio mix.
   - `AudioMix var10 = (AudioMix) var9;` is included as it creates an `AudioMix` object with dataflow from `param2`.
   - `Object var9 = var4.next();` is included because it retrieves the next item in the iterator, which will be used to create the `AudioMix` object.
   - `boolean var13 = var11.remove(var10);` is included as it removes the audio mix from the list of mixes.

The first sink array is ranked higher than the second one because it involves a system-level operation (`registerPolicyMixes`) and affects multiple mixes, whereas the second sink array only removes a single audio mix.
