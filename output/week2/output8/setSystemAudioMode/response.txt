In the provided API `setSystemAudioMode`, there is one coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink. 

1. The creation of a new object `HdmiControlService$BinderService$7 var7 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$7();` has naming similarity with the inner class `HdmiControlService$BinderService_3`, and it is used in conjunction with another method, making it a potential sink according to the positive rules.

2. The method invocation `var6.runOnServiceThread(var7);` takes the newly created object as an argument, demonstrating data flow between the two instructions. This satisfies at least one of the positive rules (method invoked taking input parameters) and thus forms part of the same sink set.

Other lines in the API do not form a coherent sink because they either involve auxiliary operations (`HdmiControlService var4 = this.this$0;`, `Handler var3 = this.mHandler;`) or generic utility methods (`var3.post(param2)`), which are excluded by the negative rules. The variable `param2` is also not defined in the provided code snippet, suggesting it might be a parameter to the method that isn't explicitly shown here, but its usage doesn't align with any positive rule in the context of forming a separate sink without additional information.

Therefore, the identified instructions are grouped together as they directly influence each other, adhering to the criteria for defining a potential sink.
