This ranking is based on the following analysis:

1. The first sink set includes the instructions that access and process split permissions from `SystemConfig`. These instructions are ranked highest because they directly handle sensitive permission information.
2. The second sink set includes the instructions that access and process specific split permission details, such as the split permission string, new permissions list, and target SDK version. These instructions are ranked second because they also handle sensitive permission information, although it's more specific than the first set.
3. The third sink set includes a single instruction that creates a new `SplitPermissionInfoParcelable` object. This instruction is ranked lowest because it doesn't directly access or process sensitive permission information, but rather prepares an object to potentially hold such data.

Each instruction in these sink sets follows at least one of the positive rules:

- The method invocation `getSplitPermissions()` has naming similarity with the API name.
- The field access and updates (e.g., `var5`, `var9`, `var12`) have a clear dataflow link to the API parameters or return values.
- The object creation (`new SplitPermissionInfoParcelable()`) is related to the API's purpose of handling split permissions.
