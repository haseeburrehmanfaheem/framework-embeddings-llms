In this API `enableTdls`, the potential sink set involves creating objects (`WifiServiceImpl$TdlsTaskParams` and `WifiServiceImpl$TdlsTask`) that have naming similarity with the API name. The creation of these objects is also influenced by the input parameters `param2` and `param3`. These objects are then used together in a method invocation, demonstrating a clear data flow link between them.

The variable `var13`, which stores the result of `Binder.getCallingUid()`, is not directly involved in this sink set as it's primarily used for authentication or logging purposes, which falls under negative rules (auxiliary operations). Hence, it does not form part of the identified sinks following the provided positive and negative rules.
