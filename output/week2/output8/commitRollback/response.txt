Note that some instructions in the provided code, such as `HandlerThread var2 = this.mHandlerThread;` and `Handler var4 = var2.getThreadHandler();`, are not included in the sinks because they do not follow at least one of the positive rules. 

The first sink set includes instructions related to getting the calling UID, accessing the context, and obtaining an instance of AppOpsManager. These instructions are potentially sensitive as they involve access control and system services.

The second sink set involves creating a new handler and posting a lambda expression to it. This could be considered less sensitive than the first set, but still has potential implications for system behavior and access control.

Both sets follow at least one of the positive rules: 
- The method `getSystemService` is invoked with naming similarity to the API name.
- The return value of `Binder.getCallingUid()` is used in conjunction with other sink cases. 

Note that logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, and auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining an instance of a class or accessing context objects) are not considered sinks according to the negative rules provided.
