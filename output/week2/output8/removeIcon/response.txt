```
In the provided API `removeIcon`, we can identify a potential sink that involves the removal of an icon. The instructions that contribute to this sink are:

1. `Object var7 = var5.remove(param2);` - This line removes an object from the `mIcons` map based on the `param2`. It has naming similarity with the API name as it involves removing something, and it directly processes the input parameter `param2`.

2. `var10.removeIcon(param2);` - This line invokes a method `removeIcon` on the `IStatusBar` object `mBar`, passing `param2` as an argument. It has high naming similarity with the API name `removeIcon`, and it directly uses the input parameter `param2`.

These two instructions are linked by their involvement in removing an icon based on the input parameter `param2`. The removal operation first occurs locally within the service (`var5.remove(param2)`), and then this change is propagated to the status bar (`var10.removeIcon(param2)`), indicating a coherent set of operations aimed at removing an icon.
