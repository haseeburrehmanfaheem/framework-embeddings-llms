```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "UserInfo var4 = var2.getCurrentUser();",
        "return var4;"
    ]
]
}
```
However, the provided code does not have a return statement for `var4`, it seems like there might be some missing code in the API. If we assume that `var4` is used later and returned by the API or used with other sink cases, then the above JSON is correct.

If we consider only the given code snippet without any assumptions about the rest of the method (which is not shown), then there are no complete sinks because none of the instructions return a value directly to the caller. But based on positive rule 1 and considering that `var2.getCurrentUser()` has naming similarity with the API name, it can be considered as a sink.

However, given the information provided in the code snippet, we should note that the method `getCurrentUser` does not have a return type (it's void), so it cannot directly return any value. Therefore, if we strictly follow the rules and only consider complete sinks with direct data flow to the API return or other sink cases, then there are no sinks in this code snippet.

Here is an example of how you might modify your analysis based on a hypothetical complete version of `getCurrentUser`:

```java
public UserInfo getCurrentUser() {
    UserController var2 = this.mUserController;
    UserInfo var4 = var2.getCurrentUser();
    return var4;
}
```

In that case, the correct JSON would be:
```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "UserInfo var4 = var2.getCurrentUser();",
        "return var4;"
    ]
]
}
```
