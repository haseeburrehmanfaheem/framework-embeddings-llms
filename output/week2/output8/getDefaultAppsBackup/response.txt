Based on the provided API code, I will analyze it to identify potential sinks. 

Here is the analysis:

- The `getDefaultAppsBackup` method does not return any value but performs several operations that can be considered as sinks.
- `int var4 = Binder.getCallingUid();` gets the UID of the calling process. This is an auxiliary operation and not a sink according to the negative rules.
- A new `ByteArrayOutputStream` object is created, which could potentially hold sensitive data if written to it later in the method.
- A new `FastXmlSerializer` object is created with specific settings (like charset), but without any direct relation to the API name or parameters. However, its output will be influenced by subsequent operations.
- The serializer starts a document and tag, which are part of creating an XML structure. This does not directly relate to sensitive data unless the content being serialized includes such data.

Considering these steps:

1. Creation of `ByteArrayOutputStream` (`var9`) has no direct naming similarity with the API but will be used for storing output that could potentially contain sensitive information.
2. The creation and configuration of `FastXmlSerializer` (`var12`) don't directly follow any positive rule since it doesn't take input parameters or have a similar name to the API, but its use influences the flow of data in the method.

However, upon closer inspection, there's no clear indication that these operations lead to handling sensitive information directly related to the `getDefaultAppsBackup` method's purpose. The method seems incomplete as provided and does not clearly demonstrate how it returns or uses the created objects in a way that would indicate a sink for access control purposes based on the given positive and negative rules.

Given this analysis, there doesn't appear to be enough information to definitively identify sinks according to the specified criteria directly within the `getDefaultAppsBackup` method as described. The operations seem more related to setting up an environment for serialization rather than handling or returning sensitive data that would require access control based on the provided positive and negative rules.

Since the code does not clearly demonstrate how these objects are used in a manner that would indicate sinks requiring access control, especially considering the lack of completion and clarity around what `param2` and `param3` represent (as they seem to be placeholders or typos in the provided snippet), it's challenging to definitively categorize any part of this code as a sink without further context.

However, if we were to follow the instructions strictly based on the information given and assuming there might have been an oversight in interpreting the method's purpose and the potential for sensitive data handling:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "ByteArrayOutputStream var9 = new ByteArrayOutputStream();",
            "FastXmlSerializer var12 = new FastXmlSerializer();"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This would be a very liberal interpretation, considering the lack of clear connection to sensitive data or access control requirements in the provided snippet. Normally, more context and understanding of what `param2` and `param3` are supposed to represent, along with how the method's output is utilized, would be necessary for an accurate assessment.
