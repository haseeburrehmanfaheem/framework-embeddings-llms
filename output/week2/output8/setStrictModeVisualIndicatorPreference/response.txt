```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "SystemProperties.set(persist.sys.strictmode.visual,param2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This API contains a single sink, which is the `SystemProperties.set` method invocation. This instruction follows one of the positive rules because it modifies a field (`persist.sys.strictmode.visual`) with the API parameter (`param2`). The accessed field has naming similarity with the API name (`setStrictModeVisualIndicatorPreference`), as both relate to "strict mode" settings, which further supports its classification as a sink.
