Based on the provided code, here is the analysis of potential sinks:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "Object var7 = var5.get(param2);",
        "FeatureInfo var8 = (FeatureInfo) var7;",
        "int var10 = var8.version;"
    ]
]
}
```

In this code, `var5.get(param2)` is a field get case with naming similarity to the API name (`mAvailableFeatures` and `hasSystemFeature`). The accessed field `var5` is used later in the code, which satisfies one of the positive rules. 

The instructions `Object var7 = var5.get(param2);`, `FeatureInfo var8 = (FeatureInfo) var7;`, and `int var10 = var8.version;` collectively contribute to a sink because they are related by dataflow: the output of `var5.get(param2)` directly influences the creation of `var8`, which is then used to access its field `version`. 

Note that there might be other parts of the API not shown in this snippet, but based on the given code, this is the only potential sink identified.
