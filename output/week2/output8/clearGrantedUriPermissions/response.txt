The provided code is for the `clearGrantedUriPermissions` API in the `UriGrantsManagerService_3`. After analyzing the code, I have identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules.

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "removeUriPermissionsForPackage(param2,param3,1,1);",
      "SparseArray var11 = this.mGrantedUriPermissions;",
      "int var13 = var11.size();",
      "var16 = var14.keyAt(var85);",
      "Object var19 = var17.valueAt(var85);",
      "ArrayMap var20 = (ArrayMap) var19;",
      "Collection var27 = var20.values();",
      "Iterator var29 = var27.iterator();",
      "UriPermission var34 = (UriPermission) var33;",
      "var34.revokeModes(var54,1);"
    ],
    [
      "this.persistableModeFlags = var16;",
      "this.persistedModeFlags = var18;",
      "this.globalModeFlags = var21;",
      "ArraySet var22 = this.mReadOwners;",
      "int var23 = this.ownedModeFlags;",
      "var24 = var23 and -2;",
      "this.ownedModeFlags = var24;"
    ],
    [
      "Iterator var26 = var22.iterator();",
      "this.mReadOwners = 0;",
      "ArraySet var47 = this.mWriteOwners;",
      "int var48 = this.ownedModeFlags;",
      "var49 = var48 and -3;",
      "this.ownedModeFlags = var49;"
    ],
    [
      "UriPermissionOwner var56 = (UriPermissionOwner) var55;",
      "var56.removeWritePermission(this);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sinks involve the following operations:

1. Revoking URI permissions for a package and updating the granted URI permissions.
2. Updating mode flags, including persistable, persisted, global, and owned mode flags.
3. Removing read and write owners from the `mReadOwners` and `mWriteOwners` sets.
4. Removing write permission for a URI permission owner.

These sinks are ranked based on their potential impact on the system's security and functionality. The most sensitive sink is the revocation of URI permissions, followed by updates to mode flags, removal of owners from sets, and finally the removal of write permission for a URI permission owner.
