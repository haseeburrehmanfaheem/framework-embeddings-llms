The provided code snippet contains multiple instructions that contribute to potential sinks. Based on the given rules, we identify two sets of instructions as potential sinks.

1. The first set involves the invocation of `syncGetPasspointConfigs` method on `ClientModeImpl` object (`var40`). This instruction has a high naming similarity with the API name `getPasspointConfigurations`, which is one of the positive rules for identifying sinks. Additionally, this method processes input parameters and returns a list of configurations.

2. The second set involves sending a synchronous message using `sendMessageSynchronously` method and then processing its result. This instruction does not have direct naming similarity with the API name but takes the input parameter as an argument (`param3`), which is one of the positive rules for identifying sinks. Moreover, this method returns a message object that contains sensitive information.

Note that other instructions in the code snippet are either auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining context objects, logging) or do not follow any of the positive rules. Therefore, they are excluded from the potential sink sets. The identified sink sets are ranked based on their sensitivity, with the first set being more sensitive as it involves direct access to passpoint configurations.
