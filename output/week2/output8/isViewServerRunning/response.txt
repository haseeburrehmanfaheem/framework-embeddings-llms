```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "boolean var11 = var9.isRunning();",
        "var9 = this.mViewServer;"
    ]
]
}
```
Explanation:
The provided API `isViewServerRunning` has a potential sink in the method invocation `var9.isRunning()`. This instruction contributes to a sink because it follows one of the positive rules: 
- The accessed field/invoked method (`mViewServer`) has naming similarity with the API name (`isViewServerRunning`).
The output of this method call is not directly returned by the API, but `var9` (which holds the result of `this.mViewServer`) does have a direct link to it. Hence, it's considered part of the same sink.

Note that other variables like `var2`, `var5`, and `var8` do not contribute to any sinks because they either involve generic utility methods or auxiliary operations (e.g., checking if a thread is alive) which are excluded by the negative rules. Also, since there's no data flow from the API parameters (if any) into these variables, they don't fit into any of the positive rules for identifying sinks.
