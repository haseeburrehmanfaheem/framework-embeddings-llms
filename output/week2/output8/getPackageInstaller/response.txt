```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "PackageInstallerService var7 = this.mInstallerService;",
        "String var5 = getInstantAppPackageName(var3);",
        "int var3 = Binder.getCallingUid();"
    ]
]
}
```
However, in the given API `getPackageInstaller`, there are no clear dataflow links between the instructions that directly influence each other. 
A better approach is to identify the actual sinks with a clear flow of data:
```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "int var3 = Binder.getCallingUid();",
        "String var5 = getInstantAppPackageName(var3);"
    ],
    [
        "PackageInstallerService var7 = this.mInstallerService;"
    ]
]
}
```
This JSON output identifies two separate sink sets. The first set includes the instructions that involve getting the calling UID and using it to get the instant app package name, which shows a clear dataflow link. 
The second set only contains one instruction, which is accessing the `mInstallerService` field. This does not have a direct dataflow link with the previous instructions but still follows the positive rule of having naming similarity with the API name (`getPackageInstaller` and `this.mInstallerService`).
