The provided code for the `setRemoveContentMode` API is quite extensive and complex. After carefully analyzing it, I identified three potential sink sets that follow at least one of the positive rules.

1.  The first sink set involves creating a new `DisplayContent` object (`var9`) and applying settings to it using `applySettingsToDisplayLocked`. This method call has high naming similarity with the API name and processes data from `DisplayWindowSettings$Entry`, which is related to the API's functionality. Additionally, this code modifies fields like `overscanLeft`, `overscanTop`, `overscanRight`, and `overscanBottom` of the `var4` object (`DisplayInfo`), indicating a clear data flow link between these instructions.
2.  The second sink set focuses on restoring settings for display rotation using the `restoreSettings` method of `DisplayRotation`. This method call is invoked with parameters obtained from `DisplayWindowSettings$Entry`, demonstrating a connection to the API's input parameters and functionality.
3.  The third sink set involves updating base display metrics based on values retrieved from `DisplayWindowSettings$Entry`. It modifies `param2.mBaseDisplayDensity` directly, which could be considered sensitive as it affects display settings.

Each of these sink sets has a coherent data flow link between the instructions listed and follows at least one positive rule (either having naming similarity with the API name or processing input parameters). The ranking from most sensitive to least sensitive is based on the direct impact on system settings and potential security implications, with modifications to display content and rotation being more critical than metric updates.
