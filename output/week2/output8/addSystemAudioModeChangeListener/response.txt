In this API `addSystemAudioModeChangeListener`, the method invocation `HdmiControlService.access$3800` has a naming similarity with the inner class name and is invoked twice, indicating that it might be contributing to a potential sink. The fact that it's called with `param2` suggests data flow from an input parameter into this method, adhering to one of the positive rules. There are no field get/set cases or object creations in this API that follow the specified rules. Note that without knowing what `access$3800` does specifically (since it seems to be generated by the compiler), we can only infer based on its invocation pattern and naming conventions. 

Given the provided information, there's a single coherent set of instructions forming a potential sink related to method invocations with similar naming and input parameter usage.
