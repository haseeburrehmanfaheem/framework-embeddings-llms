```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean var5 = var3.isUsageEnabled();",
      "var3" has naming similarity with no other variable but the method itself is invoked, 
      however since there's also another variable named var2, 
      the invocation of isUsageEnabled could potentially set or return a value 
      related to this API and so can be considered as contributing to the sink.
