Note: The ranking of the sinks is based on their sensitivity. In this case, the first sink set is ranked higher because it involves retrieving user data based on a calling UID, which can be considered more sensitive than simply accessing an abstract system service instance.

Here's a brief explanation for each identified sink:

1. The first sink set consists of `getCallingUid()` and `getUserData(var27)`. These instructions are directly related to retrieving user data based on the calling UID. This set follows the positive rule of method invocation with input parameters as arguments (`var27` is used as an argument in `getUserData()`).

2. The second sink set includes the access to `AutofillManagerService.access$3200(var9, var4)` and the subsequent casting to `AutofillManagerServiceImpl`. Although this does not directly involve user data retrieval like the first set, it involves accessing system services based on a user ID (`var4`), which can still be considered sensitive. This set follows the positive rule of method invocation with input parameters as arguments (`var4` is used as an argument in `access$3200()`).
