  "Sinks": [
    [
      "HdmiControlService$BinderService$14 var7 = new HdmiControlService$BinderService$14();",
      "var6.runOnServiceThread(var7);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

*   The code for the `sendStandby` API shows two instances where an object of type `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14` is created and then passed to the `runOnServiceThread` method.
*   Although there are duplicate lines in the provided code, they essentially represent the same operation. For the purpose of identifying sinks, we'll consider them as one coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink.
*   The creation of `HdmiControlService$BinderService$14` and its subsequent use in `runOnServiceThread` follow at least one positive rule: they have naming similarity with the API name (`sendStandby`) through their class names, which are nested within the service class related to the API. This indicates a potential sink where data or control flow is influenced by the API's parameters or state.
*   Given there's only one set of instructions that directly contribute to a sink in this API, there's no need for ranking multiple sinks by sensitivity.
