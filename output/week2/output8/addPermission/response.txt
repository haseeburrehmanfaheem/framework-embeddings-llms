In this API `addPermission`, we have identified a set of instructions that collectively contribute to a potential sink. 

1. The method `addDynamicPermission` is invoked with the input parameter `param2`. This follows the positive rule where the method invocation has naming similarity with the API name and takes the input parameters as arguments.

2. The native method `getCallingUid()` returns the calling user ID, which is then used in the subsequent method call.

3. A new object of type `PackageManagerService$3` is created. Although there's no direct data flow from this creation to other instructions, its usage in the next instruction makes it relevant to the sink set.

4. Finally, another invocation of `addDynamicPermission` occurs with the parameters `param2`, `param3`, `var6` (the calling user ID), and the newly created object `var7`. This follows multiple positive rules: naming similarity, taking input parameters as arguments, and creating an object that's used in this method call.

All these instructions are connected through data flow, where the output of one instruction directly influences the input or creation of the next. Therefore, they form a coherent set of instructions that together contribute to a potential sink in the `addPermission` API.
