```

This JSON represents the potential sink in the provided API `portSelect`. The creation of a new object `HdmiControlService$BinderService$2` and its subsequent use with the method `runOnServiceThread` contribute to this sink. Although there are multiple instances where these lines appear, they represent the same operation and thus only one set is included in the JSON output.

The instructions in the identified sink follow at least one of the positive rules:

- The object creation has naming similarity with the service name (`HdmiControlService`), which can be associated with the API's functionality.
- The `runOnServiceThread` method invocation processes this newly created object, showing a direct data flow link between these instructions.

The other lines in the code do not follow any of the positive rules or are auxiliary operations and thus are not included as part of the sink.
