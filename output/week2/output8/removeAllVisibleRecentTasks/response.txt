The provided code seems to have many duplicate lines and does not follow standard Java syntax. However, I'll analyze the API `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks` based on the given instructions.

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "RecentTasks var10 = getRecentTasks();",
      "ActivityManagerInternal var11 = this.mAmInternal;",
      "int var13 = var11.getCurrentUserId();",
      "var10.removeAllVisibleTasks(var13);"
    ],
    [
      "Set var4 = getProfileIds(param2);",
      "ArrayList var5 = this.mTasks;",
      "int var7 = var5.size();",
      "Object var13 = var5.get(var31);",
      "TaskRecord var14 = (TaskRecord) var13;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

1. The first set of instructions in `Sinks` represents a coherent set of operations that contribute to removing all visible recent tasks.
   - `getRecentTasks()` returns an object used for managing recent tasks, which has high naming similarity with the API name `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks`.
   - `getCurrentUserId()` is invoked on this object and its result is passed as an argument to `removeAllVisibleTasks()`, indicating that it processes the input parameters.
   - The return value of `getRecentTasks()` is used in the subsequent operations, showing a dataflow link between these instructions.

2. The second set of instructions represents another coherent set of operations related to task management.
   - `getProfileIds(param2)` returns a set of profile IDs that might be related to the tasks being removed.
   - `this.mTasks` is accessed and its elements are processed, indicating field access with high naming similarity to the API name (i.e., "Task").
   - The output of these operations directly influences the creation or modification of task-related objects.

Note that there might be other potential sinks in the code not captured here due to the duplicate lines and lack of standard Java syntax. These instructions follow at least one positive rule each, but their sensitivity ranking may vary depending on additional context. In this analysis, I have ranked them based on their apparent dataflow links and naming similarities with the API name `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks`.
