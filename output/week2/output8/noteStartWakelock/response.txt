This API `noteStartWakelock` does not contain any sinks that require access control based on the provided rules. The method invocations (`SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` and `SystemClock.uptimeMillis()`) are generic utility methods, which follow negative rule 1. Additionally, the field accesses (`this.mStats`) are auxiliary operations (obtaining an instance of a class), following negative rule 3. There is no data flow that contributes to a potential sink according to the positive rules provided.
