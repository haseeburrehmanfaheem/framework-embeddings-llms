```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "var4.firewallSetFirewallType(var7);",
        "this.mFirewallEnabled = param2;"
    ]
]
}
```
Explanation:
1. The method `firewallSetFirewallType` has a high naming similarity with the API name `setFirewallEnabled`, following one of the positive rules.
2. Additionally, this method invocation directly influences the firewall state, which is also modified by setting `this.mFirewallEnabled = param2;`.
3. This field set operation follows another positive rule as it has naming similarity with the API (`mFirewallEnabled` relates to `setFirewallEnabled`) and its value (`param2`) could be related to the input or state change initiated by this method, indicating a dataflow link between these two operations.

Therefore, both instructions are part of the same sink set because they collectively contribute to changing the firewall's enabled state.
