There seems to be a mistake in the provided code. The method `noteWifiScanStarted` does not have any parameters, but it is trying to pass `param2` to the inner method `noteWifiScanStartedLocked`. 

However, assuming that `param2` should actually be a parameter of the outer method or an instance field, here's how you can analyze the code.

The method `noteWifiScanStartedLocked` has high naming similarity with the API name `noteWifiScanStarted`, which matches one of the positive rules for identifying potential sinks. 

Here is the JSON representation of the sink:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "BatteryStatsImpl var5 = this.mStats;",
        "var5.noteWifiScanStartedLocked(param2);"
    ]
]
}
```

However, since `param2` does not exist in the provided method, we should consider it as a potential issue. Assuming that `noteWifiScanStartedLocked` uses some instance field or parameter of the outer method, and given the naming similarity with the API name, this could be considered a sink.

The ranking is not applicable here since there's only one identified set of instructions contributing to a sink. 

Also note that, based on the provided code snippet, `var4` seems unnecessary as it's not being used anywhere in the method.
