```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean var6 = addDynamicPermission(param2,1);",
      "boolean var10 = var4.addDynamicPermission(param2,param3,var6,var7);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The instructions that contribute to the sink are method invocations `addDynamicPermission` which have naming similarity with the API name `addPermissionAsync`. These methods also process input parameters, in this case, `param2`, indicating a data flow link between them. They follow at least one of the positive rules and do not match any negative rules. 

The creation of new object `PackageManagerService$3 var7 = new PackageManagerService$3();` does not seem to be directly linked with the API parameters or have naming similarity, hence it's not considered as part of a sink.

Similarly, accessing fields like `this.mPackages`, `this.mPermissionManager` are auxiliary operations and don't match any positive rules for being considered sinks. 

The method invocation `PackageManagerService.getCallingUid()` seems to be used in the following method call but since logging or input validation/sanity checks aren't explicitly mentioned here, this still doesn't qualify as a separate sink on its own due to lack of clear connection with API parameters and because it's more auxiliary in nature. 

Therefore, only the two `addDynamicPermission` invocations are identified as contributing to a potential sink due to their naming similarity and data flow from input parameters.
