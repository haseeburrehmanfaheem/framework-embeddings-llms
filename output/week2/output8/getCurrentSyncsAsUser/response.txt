Explanation:
- We can identify a coherent set of instructions that together form a potential sink. 
- The `getCurrentSyncsCopy` and `getCurrentSyncsLocked` methods are invoked, which have naming similarity with the API name `getCurrentSyncsAsUser`. They also process the input parameter `param2`.
- The output of these methods directly influences the creation of new `SyncInfo` objects.
- These instructions collectively contribute to a sink because they return sensitive information about current syncs as user. 
- We exclude other variables like `var13`, `var17`, `var25`, and others that are not part of this coherent set or do not have direct data propagation links with the identified sink instructions.
