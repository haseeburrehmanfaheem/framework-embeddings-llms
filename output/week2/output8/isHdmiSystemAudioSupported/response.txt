```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "boolean var2 = this.mHdmiSystemAudioSupported;",
        "boolean var2;"
    ]
]
}
```

However, given the negative rules and the fact that `var2` is declared twice which does not make sense in Java, it seems like there might be some issue with the provided code. Assuming the second declaration of `var2` was an error, we can simplify this to:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "boolean var2 = this.mHdmiSystemAudioSupported;"
    ]
]
}
```

This single instruction forms a potential sink because it accesses a field (`mHdmiSystemAudioSupported`) with naming similarity to the API name (`isHdmiSystemAudioSupported`). However, without more context on how `var2` is used (e.g., returned by the API or used in another operation that could be considered a sink), this analysis is limited. Typically, for an API named `isHdmiSystemAudioSupported`, we would expect it to return a boolean value indicating whether HDMI system audio is supported, which seems to be missing here. 

Given the information and adhering strictly to the provided format and instructions without assuming additional context or correcting potential errors in the code beyond what's directly stated:
