Note: In the original code provided, there seems to be an error with duplicate lines of code (separated by `<PATH_SEP>`), which makes it hard to provide a clear analysis. However, based on the structure and logic presented in the repeated sections, I've identified potential sinks that adhere to the given rules.

In the first sink set:
- `var56` is assigned the result of `getAppStandbyBucket`, which directly processes input parameters (`param2`, `var14`, `var54`, `var48`). This method invocation has a high naming similarity with the API name `getAppStandbyBucket`. Although there's no explicit return statement for `var56` in the provided code, considering it as the last operation related to sensitive data processing before an implicit return.

In the second sink set:
- The creation and modification of `AppIdleHistory$AppUsageHistory` objects (`var10`) are directly influenced by the API parameters. These operations have naming similarity with parts of the API's logic (e.g., `getAppStandbyBucket`). However, without explicit usage or return of these objects in a way that clearly links them to sensitive data exposure outside the method, their ranking as sinks might be considered secondary.

Given the context and focusing strictly on the instructions provided:
- Generic utility methods (like `getElapsedTime`, `getScreenOnTime`) are excluded unless they directly contribute to forming a sink.
- Logging and auxiliary operations are not included in the identified sink sets.
