```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "IStatusBar var8 = this.mBar;",
        "IStatusBar var10 = this.mBar;"
    ]
]
}
```

However, upon closer inspection of the provided code for the `showBiometricDialog` API, it appears that both instructions are auxiliary operations as they involve accessing context objects (`this.mBar`). According to the negative rules, these should not be considered sinks. 

Therefore, a more accurate response would be:

```json
{
"Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that there are no identified sinks in the provided code for the `showBiometricDialog` API based on the given positive and negative rules.
