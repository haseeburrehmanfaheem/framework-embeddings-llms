There is not enough information in the provided code snippet to accurately identify potential sinks. The parameters `param2` and `param3` are used but not defined within the given method, and it seems there might be a typo or missing context (e.g., `param2` and `param3` should likely be method parameters of `noteWakeUp`, but they are not declared).

However, based on the given instructions and focusing on the information available:

The instruction `var6.noteWakeUpLocked(param2,param3);` seems to follow one of the positive rules because it has naming similarity with the API name (`noteWakeUp`) and processes input parameters (`param2` and `param3`). However, without the full context (including method parameters), we cannot accurately assess data flow or potential sinks.

Given the information:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "BatteryStatsImpl var6 = this.mStats;",
      "var6.noteWakeUpLocked(param2,param3);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This response assumes `param2` and `param3` are meant to be method parameters or internal variables that are used in the context of the API. The actual implementation might vary based on the complete code, including how `noteWakeUpLocked` handles its parameters and any potential data flow implications. 

Please note, due to missing information (like method parameters), this analysis focuses strictly on provided instructions without considering broader contextual implications or additional sinks that might exist with a full understanding of the class, method signatures, and variable declarations.
