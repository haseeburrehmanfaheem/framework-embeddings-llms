Note: There are multiple sinks in the given API. Each sink array represents a coherent set of instructions with clear dataflow links between them.

1. The first sink involves hiding the session using `hideSessionLocked()` and `hideLocked()`. 
2. The second sink is about hiding the voice interaction session.
3. The third sink is related to revoking URI permission from the owner.
4. The fourth sink is about finishing a voice task.
5. The fifth sink involves finishing a voice task in the root activity container.

The ranking of these sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive may vary based on specific use cases and requirements, but generally, operations that directly interact with external services or modify system state (like revoking permissions or finishing tasks) are considered more sensitive than internal method calls.
