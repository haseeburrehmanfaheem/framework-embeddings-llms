The API `statusBarVisibilityChanged` has multiple sinks that require access control. Here's a breakdown of each sink:

1. The first sink involves getting the display content and changing the status bar visibility:
   - It starts with getting the root window container (`this.mRoot`) and then retrieving the display content based on `param2`.
   - Then it calls the `statusBarVisibilityChanged` method on the retrieved display content, passing `param3`.

2. The second sink involves updating the last known status bar visibility:
   - It directly updates the field `mLastStatusBarVisibility` with the value of `param2`.

3. The third sink is related to adjusting and updating system UI visibility:
   - First, it gets an instance of `DisplayPolicy`.
   - Then it adjusts the system UI visibility based on `param2` using the `adjustSystemUiVisibilityLw` method.
   - Finally, it updates the status bar visibility in a locked state with the adjusted value.

4. The fourth sink involves setting the system UI visibility for the input manager service:
   - It retrieves an instance of `InputManagerService`.
   - Then it sets the system UI visibility to `param2`.

5. The fifth sink is related to updating the system UI visibility, likely as part of a broader system update process:
   - It calls the method `updateSystemUiVisibility`, passing in `param2` and an adjusted value (`var8`).

Each of these sinks involves either direct manipulation of API parameters or objects closely related to the API's purpose, indicating potential security concerns that warrant access control.
