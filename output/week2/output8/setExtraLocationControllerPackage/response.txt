```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "this.mExtraLocationControllerPackage = param2;"
    ]
  ]
}
```
In the given API `setExtraLocationControllerPackage`, we can identify a single sink that involves setting the value of `mExtraLocationControllerPackage` to `param2`. This operation directly modifies an internal field with data from the API parameters, following one of the positive rules for identifying sinks. The instructions related to acquiring a lock (`Object var7 = this.mLock;`) and accessing context objects (`Context var3 = this.mContext;`) are considered auxiliary operations and do not contribute to potential sinks according to the negative rules provided.
