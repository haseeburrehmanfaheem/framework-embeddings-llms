After carefully analyzing the code of the `startWatchingActive` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "Object var37 = var33.get(var35);",
        "SparseArray var38 = (SparseArray) var37;",
        "SparseArray var39 = new SparseArray();",
        "Object var45 = var41.put(var43,var39);"
    ],
    [
        "AppOpsService$ActiveCallback var52 = new AppOpsService$ActiveCallback();",
        "var49.put(var55,var52);"
    ]
]
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning behind these identified sinks:

1. The first sink set involves the access and modification of the `mActiveWatchers` ArrayMap, which stores active watchers. The instructions in this set are related to getting an existing watcher (`var37 = var33.get(var35)`), creating a new SparseArray (`var39 = new SparseArray()`), and putting this new array into the `mActiveWatchers` map (`var45 = var41.put(var43,var39)`). These operations have naming similarity with the API name `startWatchingActive`, as they are directly involved in managing active watchers. The data flow link between these instructions is clear, as the output of one operation directly influences the input or creation of the next.

2. The second sink set involves the creation of a new `AppOpsService$ActiveCallback` object (`var52 = new AppOpsService$ActiveCallback()`) and its subsequent storage in another data structure (`var49.put(var55,var52)`). This has naming similarity with the API name, as it is directly related to managing active callbacks for watchers. The creation of this object and its storage are linked by a clear data flow, as the newly created callback object is put into another data structure.

These sink sets follow at least one of the positive rules: they either have naming similarity with the API name or involve the creation/modification of objects/data structures directly related to the API's purpose. They do not fall under any negative rules (e.g., generic utility methods, logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, auxiliary operations). 

Ranking these sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their direct involvement with data storage and manipulation, the first sink set involving `mActiveWatchers` modifications is more critical due to its direct impact on the service's state. The second sink set, while still significant for managing active callbacks, would be ranked as less sensitive in comparison.
