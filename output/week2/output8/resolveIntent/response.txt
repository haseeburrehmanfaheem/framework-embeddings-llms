Here's a step-by-step explanation of the identified sinks:

1. The first sink is related to resolving an intent and involves the following instructions:
   - `resolveIntentInternal` method invocation with input parameters.
   - `queryIntentActivitiesInternal` method invocation, which processes the input parameters.
   - Creation of an `ArrayList` to store activity information.
   - Invocation of `getActivityInfo` method to retrieve activity information based on the processed input parameters.
   - Creation of a new `ResolveInfo` object and assignment of activity information to it.
   - Addition of the `ResolveInfo` object to the `ArrayList`.

2. The second sink is related to post-resolution filtering and involves the following instructions:
   - Invocation of `applyPostResolutionFilter` method, which processes the input parameters and the previously created `ArrayList`.
   - Retrieval of a `ResolveInfo` object from a list or array.
   - Access to activity information and application information associated with the `ResolveInfo` object.
   - Creation of a new `ResolveInfo` object (`var52`) and assignment of auxiliary information to it.

These sinks are ranked based on their sensitivity, with the first sink being more sensitive because it involves resolving an intent and processing input parameters directly. The second sink is less sensitive as it involves post-resolution filtering, which may not have direct access to user-input data or sensitive system resources.
