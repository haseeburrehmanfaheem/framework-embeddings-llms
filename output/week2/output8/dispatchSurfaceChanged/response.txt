Explanation:

1. In the first sink set:
   - `TvInputManagerService.access$5400` is invoked with parameters including `param2`, which may be an input parameter of the API, and returns a `SessionState`.
   - The returned `SessionState` (`var22`) has high naming similarity with the internal field access `access$5400`, indicating it's likely to be related to session management.
   - This `SessionState` is then used in `TvInputManagerService.access$5500` to get an `ITvInputSession`.
   - The obtained `ITvInputSession` (`var25`) invokes `dispatchSurfaceChanged` with the API parameters `param3`, `param4`, and `param5`. 
   Since there's a data flow from the API input parameters through method invocations that result in calling `dispatchSurfaceChanged`, it satisfies the positive rules.

2. In the second sink set:
   - The field access `TvInputManagerService$SessionState.access$2700` returns an `IBinder` (`var28`) related to the session state.
   - This `IBinder` is used in `TvInputManagerService.access$5600` to obtain another `ITvInputSession`.
   - Again, this obtained `ITvInputSession` (`var35`) invokes `dispatchSurfaceChanged` with parameters `param3`, `param4`, and `param5`.
   This sequence also represents a data flow from the API's input parameters through method invocations to calling `dispatchSurfaceChanged`.

Both sink sets involve method invocations that process the API's input parameters or have naming similarity with internal field accesses, meeting at least one of the positive rules. 

The first set is ranked higher because it directly involves session state management and dispatching a surface changed event based on an initial session state retrieval, indicating a more direct handling of sensitive data or operations related to the API's purpose. The second set, while similar in invoking `dispatchSurfaceChanged`, does so through an additional layer of abstraction involving binder access, potentially making it slightly less directly impactful but still significant as it affects the same functionality.
