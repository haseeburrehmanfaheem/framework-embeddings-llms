The provided code for the `getInitialDisplaySize` API has been analyzed to identify potential sinks based on the given positive and negative rules. 

1. The method invocation `var6.getDisplayContent(param2)` could be considered a sink due to its naming similarity with the API name and because it processes the input parameter `param2`. However, this alone does not directly lead to an output or modification of sensitive data that is returned by the API.

2. The field get cases for `var8.mInitialDisplayWidth` and `var8.mInitialDisplayHeight` are identified as sinks. These fields have naming similarity with the API name (`getInitialDisplaySize`) in the context of accessing display dimensions, which is directly related to the purpose of this API. Moreover, these accessed fields (`mInitialDisplayWidth` and `mInitialDisplayHeight`) are used to update the `param3.x` and `param3.y`, indicating a clear data flow link from the field access to the output or modification of sensitive data.

The identified sink set includes instructions that collectively contribute to accessing and returning initial display size dimensions. The fields accessed (`var8.mInitialDisplayWidth` and `var8.mInitialDisplayHeight`) are used to update `param3.x` and `param3.y`, which represents a direct data flow link from the field access to the output of sensitive data (initial display size).

Other parts of the code, such as boosting priority, resetting priority after locked sections, accessing thread states, or updating region counters, do not directly contribute to sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules provided. These operations are considered auxiliary and thus excluded from being classified as sinks according to the given negative rules.
