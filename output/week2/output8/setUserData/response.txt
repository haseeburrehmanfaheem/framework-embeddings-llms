      "AutofillManagerService var8 = this.this$0;",
      "AbstractPerUserSystemService var10 = AutofillManagerService.access$3500(var8,var4);",
      "AutofillManagerServiceImpl var11 = (AutofillManagerServiceImpl) var10;",
      "var11.setUserData(var27,param2);"
    ],
    [
      "this.mUserData = param3;",
      "UserData var9 = this.mUserData;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here is the explanation for identifying these sinks:

1. The first sink involves a series of method invocations that start with accessing `var8`, which has naming similarity with the service (`AutofillManagerService`). This access is followed by getting an instance of `AbstractPerUserSystemService` using `access$3500`, which processes the input parameter `var4`. Then, it casts to `AutofillManagerServiceImpl` and invokes `setUserData`, passing `var27` (derived from `getCallingUid()`) and `param2` as arguments. This set of instructions forms a coherent data flow that directly influences each other.

2. The second sink involves updating the field `mUserData` with `param3`. Although it's not directly linked to the first set through method invocations or object creation, it does modify an internal state (`this.mUserData`) using one of the API parameters (`param3`). Given its direct modification based on an input parameter and subsequent use (in line with the rules for field updates), this forms another sink. 

Note that some parts of the code like logging or auxiliary operations are not considered sinks here as per the provided negative rules. Also, note that `var4` being used in a log statement isn't directly relevant to identifying these sinks.
