In this code, there are three potential sink sets:

1. The first set involves the `queryIntentActivitiesInternal` method invocations, which take input parameters and return a list of activities that match the given intent.
2. The second set involves creating an `ArrayList`, getting `ActivityInfo`, creating a new `ResolveInfo`, setting its `activityInfo`, and adding it to the `ArrayList`. This set is related to processing activity information.
3. The third set involves applying a post-resolution filter to the list of activities, which may also involve sensitive data.

Note that some code lines have been removed from the original code for better readability, but they do not affect the potential sink sets identified above. Also, keep in mind that this analysis is based on the provided rules and might need further refinement depending on specific requirements or additional context.
