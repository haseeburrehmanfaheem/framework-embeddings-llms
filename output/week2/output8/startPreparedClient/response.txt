In this API `startPreparedClient`, we can see that it invokes a method named `access$3400` which has high naming similarity with the internal methods of `FaceService`. The input parameter `param2` is used in this invocation, suggesting data flow from the API parameters to the invoked method. 

The instruction `FaceService var3 = this.this$0;` and `FaceService var6 = this.this$0;` seem to be auxiliary operations (obtaining an instance of a class or accessing context objects) and thus do not contribute to potential sinks according to the negative rules provided.

There is only one set of instructions that could potentially form a sink, related to the invocation of `access$3400`. Since there's no direct data propagation to other parts of the code within this API that follow at least one positive rule, it remains as the sole entry in our JSON output.
