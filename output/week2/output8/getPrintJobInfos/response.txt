Based on the provided API code for `getPrintJobInfos`, I've identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. Here's the JSON output with ranked sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var19 = var15.getPrintJobInfos(var12);",
      "UserState$PrintJobForAppCache var3 = this.mPrintJobForAppCache;",
      "List var5 = var3.getPrintJobs(param2);",
      "ArrayMap var6 = new ArrayMap();",
      "int var9 = var5.size();",
      "Object var12 = var5.get(var22);",
      "PrintJobInfo var13 = (PrintJobInfo) var12;",
      "PrintJobId var15 = var13.getId();",
      "Object var17 = var6.put(var15, var13);"
    ],
    [
      "RemotePrintSpooler var25 = this.mSpooler;",
      "List var28 = var25.getPrintJobInfos(0,-1,param2);"
    ],
    [
      "UserState var15 = getOrCreateUserStateLocked(var5, 0);",
      "UserState$PrintJobForAppCache var3 = this.mPrintJobForAppCache;"
    ],
    [
      "RemotePrintSpooler$GetPrintJobInfosCaller var12 = this.mGetPrintJobInfosCaller;",
      "IPrintSpooler var14 = getRemoteInstanceLazy();",
      "List var16 = var12.getPrintJobInfos(var14, param2, param3, param4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The ranking is based on the sensitivity of the data being accessed or manipulated. The first sink set involves accessing print job information for a specific user and app, which could be sensitive. The second sink set involves retrieving print job information from the remote spooler, which may also contain sensitive data. The third sink set involves creating or retrieving a user state object, which could potentially contain sensitive information about the user's printing activity. The fourth sink set involves interacting with the remote print spooler to retrieve print job information, which may be less sensitive than the other sinks but still requires access control.

Note that some instructions, such as `throwIfCalledOnMainThread()` and `bindLocked()`, are not included in the sink sets because they do not directly contribute to accessing or manipulating sensitive data. Similarly, logging statements and auxiliary operations like obtaining a lock or context object are excluded from the sink sets.
