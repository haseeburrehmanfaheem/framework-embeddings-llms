```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "long var12 = var10.getScreenUnlockedFunctions();",
      "long var4 = var2.getScreenUnlockedFunctions();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Note that the instructions related to `var2`, `var6`, and the repeated calls to `Preconditions.checkState(var8)` are considered auxiliary operations or logging/input validation and thus do not contribute to potential sinks according to the provided rules. The method invocations `getScreenUnlockedFunctions()` on both `var10` and `var2` have naming similarity with the API name `getScreenUnlockedFunctions`, making them potential sinks following at least one of the positive rules. However, there's no data flow between these two calls in terms of input/output propagation; they seem to be separate invocations without direct dependency on each other's output. But given their nature and purpose within the context of this API, they are grouped together as they represent similar operations.
