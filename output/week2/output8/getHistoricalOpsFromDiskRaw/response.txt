After analyzing the provided Java code for the `getHistoricalOpsFromDiskRaw` API, I have identified potential sinks that follow at least one of the positive rules. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "AppOpsManager$HistoricalOpsRequest$Builder var9 = new AppOpsManager$HistoricalOpsRequest$Builder();",
      "AppOpsManager$HistoricalOpsRequest$Builder var12 = var9.setUid(param2);",
      "AppOpsManager$HistoricalOpsRequest$Builder var14 = var12.setPackageName(param3);",
      "AppOpsManager$HistoricalOpsRequest$Builder var16 = var14.setOpNames(param4);",
      "AppOpsManager$HistoricalOpsRequest$Builder var18 = var16.setFlags(param7);",
      "AppOpsManager$HistoricalOpsRequest var20 = var18.build();",
      "var42.getHistoricalOpsFromDiskRaw(param2,param3,var39,param5,param6,param7,param8);"
    ],
    [
      "AppOpsManager$HistoricalOps var14 = new AppOpsManager$HistoricalOps();",
      "HistoricalRegistry$Persistence.access$100(var16,var14,param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,param7);",
      "Bundle var18 = new Bundle();",
      "var18.putParcelable(historical_ops,var14);",
      "sendResult(var18);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

These sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact. The first sink involves the creation and modification of an `AppOpsManager$HistoricalOpsRequest` object, which is then used to retrieve historical operations from disk. This sink has high sensitivity due to its direct involvement with user data and API parameters.

The second sink involves the creation of a new `AppOpsManager$HistoricalOps` object, which is then populated with data using the `HistoricalRegistry$Persistence.access$100` method. The resulting object is then sent as a parcelable in a bundle via the `sendResult` method. This sink has moderate sensitivity due to its involvement with user data and API parameters, but it does not directly interact with disk operations like the first sink.

Note that some instructions, such as logging statements, auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining context objects or locks), and generic utility methods (e.g., `Preconditions.checkNotNull`), are excluded from the identified sinks as they do not meet the positive rules.
