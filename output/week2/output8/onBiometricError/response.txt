```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "IStatusBar var4 = this.mBar;",
        "IStatusBar var6 = this.mBar;",
        "var6.onBiometricError(param2);"
    ]
]
}
```

However, the provided API `onBiometricError` does not seem to have a parameter named `param2`. It seems there might be some discrepancy in the code. Assuming that `param2` is actually an argument passed into the method or a field accessed within the class, we can infer the above JSON.

Given the positive rules and the provided API:
- The method invocation `var6.onBiometricError(param2);` has naming similarity with the API name `onBiometricError`, thus it follows one of the positive rules.
- Field access cases (`this.mBar`) have naming similarity with no specific field in this context but are used to invoke a method that contributes to a sink, so they indirectly follow one of the positive rules by enabling the invocation of `var6.onBiometricError(param2);`.

Note: Without knowing the exact nature or source of `param2`, it's challenging to definitively state its relationship with the API parameters. However, given the context and assuming `param2` is related to the operation performed within `onBiometricError`, we can consider the method invocation as a potential sink due to its naming similarity and interaction with what seems to be an internal or external parameter/field (`param2`).
