This JSON represents two potential sink sets in the `injectInputAfterTransactionsApplied` API.

The first sink set includes instructions that create a new `SurfaceControl$Transaction` object, synchronize input windows using this transaction, and apply it. This set is considered more sensitive because it involves creating and applying a transaction that can potentially affect the system's surface control, which may have security implications.

The second sink set involves accessing and clearing an `ArrayMap` called `mResizedSurfaces`. Although less sensitive than the first set due to its primarily internal nature (managing resized surfaces), it still represents a data flow and manipulation of internal state that could be considered a sink. The ranking from most sensitive to least sensitive places the transaction-related operations at the top, followed by the surface management operations.

Each instruction in these sets directly influences the input or creation of the next instruction within its respective set, demonstrating a clear dataflow link between them.
