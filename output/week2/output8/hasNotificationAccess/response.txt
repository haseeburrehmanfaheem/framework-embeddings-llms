      "String var13 = Settings$Secure.getString(var10,enabled_notification_listeners);",
      "SettingsStringUtil$ComponentNameSet var14 = new SettingsStringUtil$ComponentNameSet();",
      "boolean var17 = var14.contains(param2);"

The provided code has two sets of instructions that can be considered as potential sinks. 

1. The first set involves reading a secure setting `enabled_notification_listeners` and checking if it contains the component name stored in `param2`. This operation is sensitive because it accesses security settings and checks for specific permissions.

2. The second set involves accessing a map (`this.map`) and checking if it contains a key equal to `param2`. Although this operation seems less sensitive than the first one, it still handles access control by verifying the presence of a certain key in a map.

Both sets follow positive rules: 
- They have naming similarity with variables used within the API (e.g., `var13`, `var14`, and `var17` are related to the secure settings check; `var4` is related to the map access).
- The return values of these operations (`boolean var17` and `boolean var6`) could influence subsequent decisions or actions within the API, even though their direct usage isn't shown in this snippet.

The ranking from most sensitive to least sensitive places the secure settings check first because it directly involves security settings and permission checks, which are typically more critical than map lookups.
