Since there are no method invocations, field updates, or object creations that directly relate to the API name "isUserRunning" or its parameters, and the provided code does not follow any of the positive rules for identifying sinks (such as naming similarity with the API, taking input parameters as arguments, returning values used by the API, etc.), there are no identified sinks in this API.

Therefore, the JSON response would be:

```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```
