Explanation:
1. The first set of sinks is identified by the following code instructions: 
- `this.mHdmiSystemAudioSupported = param2;` updates a field with naming similarity to the API name.
- `var12.setForceUse_Async(5,var11,setHdmiSystemAudioSupported);`, `sendIILMsgNoDelay(4,2,param2,param3,param4);`, and `sendIILMsg(param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,0);` are method invocations that process the API input parameters.
These instructions collectively contribute to a sink as they have direct data propagation links between them.

2. The second set of sinks is identified by the following code instructions:
- `long var20 = Binder.clearCallingIdentity();` and `Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(var20);` are method invocations that follow the rules for auxiliary operations, but in this context, clearing and restoring the calling identity could be considered a security-related operation. However, according to the provided negative rules, these should not be considered sinks as they relate more to auxiliary operations.

However, after re-evaluation considering the specific request to rank from most sensitive to least sensitive and following at least one of the positive rules:
- The first set clearly involves setting system audio properties based on input parameters and thus directly influences the state of the HDMI system audio support.
- The second set, while related to security context management (clearing and restoring calling identity), does not directly involve data flows that would be considered as sinks under the provided definitions focusing on access control for Android APIs.

Therefore, the ranking places the first set at the top due to its direct involvement with setting system properties based on input parameters. The second set, although security-related, is auxiliary in nature and thus ranked lower or not considered a primary sink under these specific criteria. However, it has been included initially but upon closer inspection fits more into auxiliary operations rather than sinks that require access control.

The final assessment places the first set of instructions as the primary sink due to its direct handling of system audio support properties based on input parameters, aligning with the positive rules provided for identifying sinks in Android APIs.
