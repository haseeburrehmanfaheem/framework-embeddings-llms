```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "long var3 = this.mPtr;",
      "boolean var5 = InputManagerService.nativeIsInputDeviceEnabled(var3,param2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```
However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided code. The `param2` variable is not declared or initialized anywhere in the given snippet, which could indicate an incomplete code example.

Additionally, it appears that the `var5` variable is declared twice without any assignment or utilization of its value after being assigned by the native method call. This might be a part of a larger context where this value is used, but based on the provided information:

- The `long var3 = this.mPtr;` line accesses an internal field (`mPtr`) which could potentially contribute to a sink if it directly influences the outcome of the subsequent operation.
- The `InputManagerService.nativeIsInputDeviceEnabled(var3,param2);` call involves a native method invocation with parameters that include both an internal field and what seems to be an external parameter (`param2`). This follows at least one positive rule by taking input parameters (or in this case, an internal state) as arguments.

Given the context, if `var5` or its equivalent is returned or used in a subsequent operation that could be considered sensitive (like influencing another method call or being part of a data flow leading to a potential security concern), it would further solidify the identification of these lines as contributing to a sink. However, without additional context on how `param2` and `var5` are utilized beyond this snippet, we can only assess based on what's directly provided.
