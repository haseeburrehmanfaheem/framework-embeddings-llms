{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "String var3 = this.mSharedSystemSharedLibraryPackageName;",
        "return var3;"
    ]
]
} 
However, the return statement is missing in the provided code snippet. For a complete analysis, here's an updated version of what it might look like if the method was supposed to return `var3`:
```java
public String getSharedSystemSharedLibraryPackageName() {
    ArrayMap var2 = this.mPackages;
    String var3 = this.mSharedSystemSharedLibraryPackageName;
    return var3;
}
```
Given this corrected version, here's a more accurate response:
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "String var3 = this.mSharedSystemSharedLibraryPackageName;",
        "return var3;"
    ]
]
}
