```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "BatteryStatsImpl var5 = this.mStats;",
      "var6.noteWifiBatchedScanStartedFromSourceLocked(param2,param3);"
    ]
  ]
}
```
However, there are a few issues with the given API. 

- The parameters `param2` and `param3` seem to be used but not declared anywhere in the method.
- There is an extra semicolon after the call to `noteWifiBatchedScanStartedFromSourceLocked`.
- It seems like `var5` and `var6` are referring to the same object `this.mStats`, which might be unnecessary.

Assuming that these issues are fixed, we can see that there is only one potential sink. The method `noteWifiBatchedScanStartedFromSourceLocked` has a naming similarity with the API name `noteWifiBatchedScanStartedFromSource`. 

However, since `param2` and `param3` seem to be used but not declared anywhere in the method, we cannot say for certain if they are input parameters or not. If they were declared as method parameters, this would follow one of the positive rules (the return value is returned by the API or the method invocation takes the input parameters as arguments). 

Given the information and assuming `param2` and `param3` are indeed method parameters, we have identified a sink that follows at least one of the positive rules.
