```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var3 = this.mContextHubInfoList;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

This API `getContextHubs` has a single sink that follows the positive rule of having naming similarity with the API name (`mContextHubInfoList` contains the word "Context", which is also present in "getContextHubs"). The accessed field `mContextHubInfoList` is returned by the API implicitly, as it is assigned to a local variable. There are no method invocations or object creations that contribute to sinks in this case.
