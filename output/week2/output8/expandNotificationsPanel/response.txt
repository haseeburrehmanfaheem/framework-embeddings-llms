```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "IStatusBar var3 = this.mBar;",
      "IStatusBar var5 = this.mBar;",
      "var5.animateExpandNotificationsPanel();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The instructions are grouped together because `animateExpandNotificationsPanel()` has a naming similarity with the API name `expandNotificationsPanel` and is invoked on an object (`mBar`) accessed in the previous lines, indicating a clear data flow link between them. Although there's no direct data propagation from `var3`, it contributes to understanding how `mBar` (and thus `var5`) is accessed, making it part of the coherent set of instructions leading to the invocation of `animateExpandNotificationsPanel()`. This set follows at least one positive rule: method invoked with naming similarity to the API name.
