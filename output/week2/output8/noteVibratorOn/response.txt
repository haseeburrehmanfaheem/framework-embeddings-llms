There seems to be an issue with the provided code snippet. The parameters `param2` and `param3` are not defined anywhere in the given method `noteVibratorOn()`. 

However, assuming that these parameters should be part of the method signature or are somehow available within the context, let's analyze the given code.

The instruction `var6.noteVibratorOnLocked(param2,param3);` is repeated twice. This seems to be a redundant operation and might be an error in the provided snippet.

Given the information, here's how we can identify potential sinks based on the positive rules:

- The method invocation `noteVibratorOnLocked(param2,param3)` has naming similarity with the API name `noteVibratorOn`.
- It processes parameters (`param2` and `param3`) that are presumably related to the API's functionality, even though they're not defined in this snippet.

Therefore, we can consider the following as a potential sink:

```json
{
    "Sinks": [
        [
            "BatteryStatsImpl var6 = this.mStats;",
            "var6.noteVibratorOnLocked(param2,param3);"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Note that without proper parameter definitions and possibly other context, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive analysis. The provided JSON represents the most straightforward interpretation based on the given code and rules for identifying sinks.
