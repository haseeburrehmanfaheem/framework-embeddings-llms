```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "int var16 = var11.noteOp(15,var13,param2);",
        "Uri var22 = var20.importTextMessage(param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,param7,param8);"
    ]
]
}
```
Explanation:
1. The `noteOp` method invocation has a naming similarity with the concept of importing a text message, as it checks for an operation related to the import. It also processes the input parameter `param2`.
2. The `importTextMessage` method invocation directly corresponds to the API name and purpose. It takes multiple parameters (`param2`, `param3`, `param4`, `param5`, `param6`, `param7`, `param8`) as arguments, indicating a strong data flow link from these inputs.
3. Both instructions collectively contribute to the sink by checking an operation and then performing the actual import of the text message based on that check.

Instructions like `AppOpsManager var11 = MmsServiceBroker.access$500(var9);` are auxiliary operations for obtaining an instance or accessing context objects, which do not directly contribute to a sink. Similarly, `int var13 = Binder.getCallingUid();` is used in the `noteOp` method but does not directly follow one of the positive rules on its own as it's more related to logging or input validation/sanity checks.
