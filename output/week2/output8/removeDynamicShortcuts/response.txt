The provided API `removeDynamicShortcuts` contains several potential sinks that follow the positive rules. 

1. The first sink is related to the method invocations `getPackageShortcutsForPublisherLocked` and `ensureImmutableShortcutsNotIncludedWithIds`. These methods have naming similarity with the API name `removeDynamicShortcuts` and process the input parameters `param2` and `param3`.

2. The second sink involves the field access and method invocation `Preconditions.checkNotNull`, `getUserShortcutsLocked`, and `getPackageShortcuts`. Although `Preconditions.checkNotNull` is a generic utility method, its output directly influences the creation of `ShortcutUser` and `ShortcutPackage` objects, which are used in subsequent operations.

3. The third sink involves the method invocation `scheduleSaveUser` on the `ShortcutService` object. This method call takes the `mUserId` as an argument, which is a field with naming similarity to the API name. 

Note that some instructions like logging methods and auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining locks or context objects) are not included in the sinks as they do not follow the positive rules.

The ranking of the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive is based on their potential impact on the system's security and data flow. The first sink has a direct influence on the removal of dynamic shortcuts, making it the most sensitive. The second sink involves the creation and access of shortcut packages, which could potentially reveal sensitive information about the user's shortcuts. The third sink schedules the saving of user data, which might not be as critical but still involves user-specific information.
