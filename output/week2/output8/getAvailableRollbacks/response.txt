To identify the sinks in the provided API `getAvailableRollbacks`, we need to analyze the code and apply the positive rules for identifying potential sinks. These rules include method invocations, field access and updates, object creation, and data flows that follow specific criteria such as naming similarity with the API name or direct involvement with the API's parameters.

The provided code snippet appears to be incomplete and contains some redundant lines due to what seems like a copy-paste error. However, we can still identify key components:

1. **Method Invocations**: 
   - `getHandler()`: This method is invoked to obtain a handler object.
   - `var20.post(var21)`: A lambda expression is posted to the handler, indicating an asynchronous operation.
   - `ensureRollbackDataLoadedLocked()`: This method ensures that rollback data is loaded while holding a lock.

2. **Field Access and Updates**:
   - `this.mHandlerThread`, `this.mLock`, `this.mRollbacks`: These fields are accessed but do not directly contribute to sinks based on the provided positive rules without further context on their usage in relation to API parameters or return values.

3. **Object Creation**:
   - `new LinkedBlockingQueue()`: Creates a new queue object.
   - `-$$Lambda$RollbackManagerServiceImpl$oLwS8G_DUyKmAeNKhLfFpV3VJTA var21 = new -$$Lambda$RollbackManagerServiceImpl$oLwS8G_DUyKmAeNKhLfFpV3VJTA();`: Creates a lambda expression object.
   - `new ArrayList()`: Creates an array list.

4. **Data Flows**:
   - The data flow from `getHandler()` to posting a lambda expression, and then taking an object from the queue (`var17.take()`) shows a clear asynchronous operation sequence.
   - Accessing `this.mRollbacks` and iterating over it to add elements to `var37` indicates processing of rollback data.

Given these observations, we can identify potential sinks based on the criteria provided:

- The creation of `var21` (the lambda expression) and its posting to `var20` (the handler) could be considered a sink due to its involvement in asynchronous operation and potential impact on system state.
- The iteration over `this.mRollbacks` and the addition of elements to `var37` could also be seen as contributing to a sink, especially if `var37` is used later in a sensitive context (e.g., returned by the API or used in another sensitive operation).

However, without clear evidence of these operations directly affecting access control or security-sensitive data based on the provided rules, it's challenging to definitively categorize them as sinks.

Given the information and focusing strictly on the criteria:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "Handler var20 = getHandler();",
        "-$$Lambda$RollbackManagerServiceImpl$oLwS8G_DUyKmAeNKhLfFpV3VJTA var21 = new -$$Lambda$RollbackManagerServiceImpl$oLwS8G_DUyKmAeNKhLfFpV3VJTA();",
        "boolean var24 = var20.post(var21);"
    ],
    [
        "ArrayList var37 = new ArrayList();",
        "List var39 = this.mRollbacks;",
        "int var41 = var39.size();",
        "Object var44 = var42.get(var56);",
        "RollbackData var45 = (RollbackData) var44;"
    ]
]
}
```

This JSON represents potential sinks based on method invocations and object creations that could influence system state or security-sensitive data. However, the actual sensitivity of these operations would depend on further analysis of how `var37` and the lambda expression are used within the context of access control for Android APIs.
