Based on the provided code, here are the potential sinks that require access control:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "InputDevice var4 = this.mInputDevices;",
        "5 = arraylength 4;",
        "InputDevice var7 = this.mInputDevices;",
        "8 = arrayload 7[13];",
        "int var10 = var8.getId();"
    ]
]
}
```

However, a closer look at the code reveals that `var3` and `arraylength` operation do not directly contribute to data flow leading to potential sensitive information exposure. The primary concern lies in accessing and manipulating elements of `mInputDevices`, specifically through array access (`arrayload`) and the subsequent method invocation on the accessed object (`getId()`). 

The correct identification should focus on instructions that collectively lead to handling potentially sensitive input device information:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "InputDevice var7 = this.mInputDevices;",
        "8 = arrayload 7[13];",
        "int var10 = var8.getId();"
    ]
]
}
```

In the given API `getInputDevice`, these instructions are directly related to accessing and processing input device data, adhering to positive rules such as having naming similarity with the API name (`mInputDevices` accessed in relation to `getInputDevice`) and involving method invocations that process or return potentially sensitive information (`getId()`). The variable `var3` (lock object) is not directly involved in handling sensitive data and thus does not form part of a sink set based on provided positive rules.
