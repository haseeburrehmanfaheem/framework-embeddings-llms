    ]
]
}
```
Explanation: 
In the provided code, we have a method `getAppIdUserWhitelist()` which calls another inner method `getAppIdUserWhitelistInternal()`. 

1. `DeviceIdleController var2 = this.this$0;` is an auxiliary operation to obtain an instance of the class and thus does not follow any positive rules directly.
   
2. `[I var4 = var2.getAppIdUserWhitelistInternal();` has a naming similarity with the API name (`getAppIdUserWhitelist()`), which matches one of the positive rules for method invocations.

However, note that there's an inconsistency in the provided code where `var2` is reassigned. The initial assignment to `var2` does not directly contribute to identifying it as a sink due to being an auxiliary operation. 

The reassignment of `[I var2 = this.mPowerSaveWhitelistUserAppIdArray;` and its subsequent unused declaration do not propagate the data flow from `getAppIdUserWhitelistInternal()` and thus are not considered part of the same sink.

Therefore, only the invocation of `getAppIdUserWhitelistInternal()` clearly follows one of the positive rules (naming similarity) and is directly influenced by the API's parameters or context. 

Since there's no additional data flow or method invocation that meets the criteria for another distinct sink, we're left with a single identified set of instructions contributing to a potential sink in this code snippet.
