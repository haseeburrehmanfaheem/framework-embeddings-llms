Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `getContentProviderExternal`, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ContentProviderHolder var25 = getContentProviderExternalUnchecked(param2,param4,var20,var23,var18);",
      "ContentProviderHolder var10 = getContentProviderImpl(0,param2,param3,param4,0,param5,1,param6);"
    ],
    [
      "ContentProviderHolder var1131 = var99.newHolder(0);",
      "ContentProviderHolder var3 = new ContentProviderHolder();",
      "var3.provider = var6;",
      "var3.noReleaseNeeded = var7;",
      "var3.connection = param2;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink is more sensitive because it involves getting a content provider holder using `getContentProviderExternalUnchecked` and `getContentProviderImpl`, which may return sensitive information about the content provider.
2. The second sink is less sensitive but still important as it creates a new content provider holder and sets its properties, including the provider instance and connection.

The reasoning behind identifying these sinks is based on the positive rules:

* Method invocation: `getContentProviderExternalUnchecked` and `getContentProviderImpl` have naming similarity with the API name `getContentProviderExternal`.
* Object creation: A new `ContentProviderHolder` object is created using data flow from the API parameters.
* Field access and updates: The `provider`, `noReleaseNeeded`, and `connection` fields of the `ContentProviderHolder` object are accessed and updated.

The identified sinks do not follow any negative rules, such as generic utility methods, logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, or auxiliary operations.
