After analyzing the provided Java code, I did not find any potential sinks that require access control. The method `checkPermissionWithToken` is empty and does not perform any operations that could be considered a sink.

However, it's worth noting that the method name suggests that it might be related to permission checking, which could potentially involve sensitive operations. But without any actual code inside the method, there are no sinks to identify.

Therefore, I will provide an empty JSON response:

```
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that no potential sinks were found in the provided Java code.
