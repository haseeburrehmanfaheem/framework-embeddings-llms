Here is the analysis of the API `notifyLockedProfile`:

{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ActivityTaskManagerInternal var3 = this.mAtmInternal;",
      "UserController var4 = this.mUserController;",
      "int var6 = var4.getCurrentUserId();",
      "var3.notifyLockedProfile(param2,var6);"
    ]
  ]
}

Reasoning:

The API `notifyLockedProfile` has a single sink, which is the method invocation `var3.notifyLockedProfile(param2,var6)`. This instruction follows the positive rule of having a naming similarity with the API name (`notifyLockedProfile`). Additionally, the parameters `param2` and `var6` are used as arguments to the method.

The variable `var3` is an instance of `ActivityTaskManagerInternal`, which is obtained from the field `mAtmInternal`. The variable `var4` is an instance of `UserController`, which is obtained from the field `mUserController`. The variable `var6` is assigned the result of calling `getCurrentUserId()` on `var4`.

The method invocation `var3.notifyLockedProfile(param2,var6)` is the most sensitive instruction in this sink, as it involves notifying a locked profile with potentially sensitive information.

Ranking: High sensitivity (1)

Note that there are no other sinks in this API, and the identified sink follows at least one of the positive rules.
