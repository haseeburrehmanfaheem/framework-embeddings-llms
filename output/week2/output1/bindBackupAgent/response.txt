Here are the identified sinks in JSON format, following the specified rules:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "IPackageManager var14 = AppGlobals.getPackageManager();",
      "ApplicationInfo var17 = var14.getApplicationInfo(param2,1024,var12);"
    ],
    [
      "var23.setPackageStoppedState(var24,0[var27];"
    ],
    [
      "BackupRecord var60 = new BackupRecord();",
      "ComponentName var65 = new ComponentName();",
      "String var66 = var20.packageName;",
      "String var67 = var20.backupAgentName;",
      "HostingRecord var74 = new HostingRecord();",
      "ProcessRecord var83 = startProcessLocked(var73,var20,0,0[var74,0,0,0);"
    ],
    [
      "ProcessList var10 = this.mProcessList;",
      "ProcessRecord var13 = var10.startProcessLocked(param2,param3,param4,param5[param6,param7,param8,0[param9,0,0,0,0];"
    ],
    [
      "AppErrors var52 = var51.mAppErrors;",
      "boolean var54 = var52.isBadProcessLocked(param3);",
      "IApplicationThread var65 = var59.thread;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking of the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink, which includes the package manager and application info retrieval (`IPackageManager` and `ApplicationInfo`), is ranked as the most sensitive because it deals with sensitive package information.
2. The second sink, which sets the package stopped state (`var23.setPackageStoppedState(var24,0[var27];`), is ranked as the second most sensitive because it modifies package state.
3. The third sink, which creates a backup record and component name (`BackupRecord var60 = new BackupRecord();`, `ComponentName var65 = new ComponentName();`), is ranked as less sensitive but still important due to its involvement with backup data.
4. The fourth sink, which starts a process (`ProcessList var10 = this.mProcessList;`, `ProcessRecord var13 = var10.startProcessLocked(param2,param3,param4,param5[param6,param7,param8,0[param9,0,0,0,0];`), is ranked as relatively less sensitive since it's related to general process management.
5. The fifth sink, which involves error handling and thread interactions (`AppErrors var52 = var51.mAppErrors;`, `boolean var54 = var52.isBadProcessLocked(param3);`, `IApplicationThread var65 = var59.thread;`), is ranked as the least sensitive since it's more related to generic process monitoring.

Note that this ranking may vary based on specific requirements or use cases.
