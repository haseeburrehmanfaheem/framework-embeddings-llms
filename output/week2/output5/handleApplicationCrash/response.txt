Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `handleApplicationCrash`, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the ranked sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object var7 = new Object(8);",
      "arraystore 7[12] = 11;",
      "arraystore 7[19] = 18;",
      "arraystore 7[20] = 4;",
      "arraystore 7[27] = 26;",
      "arraystore 7[28] = 29;",
      "arraystore 7[30] = 31;",
      "arraystore 7[32] = 33;",
      "arraystore 7[34] = 37;"
    ],
    [
      "addErrorToDropBox(param2,param3,param4,0,0,0,0,0,0,param5);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink set is ranked higher because it involves creating a new object and storing sensitive data in its array fields. The instructions collectively contribute to this sink by creating the object, converting integers to Integer objects, and storing these values in the object's array fields.

The second sink set is related to adding an error to the DropBox, which might be less sensitive but still requires access control due to the potential for exposing crash information.

Note that I have excluded instructions that do not follow at least one of the positive rules or are generic utility methods, logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, or auxiliary operations.
