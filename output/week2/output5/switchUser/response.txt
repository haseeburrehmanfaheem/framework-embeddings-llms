Based on the provided Java code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON representation of the sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserController var3 = this.mUserController;",
      "boolean var5 = var3.switchUser(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "UserInfo var8 = getUserInfo(param2);",
      "boolean var12 = var8.supportsSwitchTo();",
      "boolean var14 = var8.isManagedProfile();"
    ],
    [
      "this.mTargetUserId = param2;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind identifying these sinks:

1. The first sink is related to the `switchUser` method invocation on the `UserController` object. This method takes `param2` as an argument, which is likely a user ID. The naming similarity with the API name and the use of the input parameter make this a potential sink.
2. The second sink involves accessing the `UserInfo` object using the `getUserInfo` method, which returns information about the user with ID `param2`. The subsequent method calls on the `UserInfo` object to check if the user supports switching to and is a managed profile are also part of this sink. These operations have naming similarity with the API name and use the input parameter.
3. The third sink is related to updating the `mTargetUserId` field with the value of `param2`. This field update has naming similarity with the API name.

Note that I have excluded some code blocks from being considered as sinks, such as the repeated assignments to `var3`, `var5`, and `var6`, as they do not seem to contribute to any sensitive operations or data flows. Additionally, some method calls like `getCurrentUserId()` and `ServiceManager.getService(user)` are likely auxiliary operations and do not meet the positive rules for sinks.

These sinks are ranked in order of sensitivity, with the first sink being the most sensitive as it involves a direct method invocation on a user controller object. The second sink is moderately sensitive as it accesses user information, while the third sink is less sensitive as it only updates an internal field.
