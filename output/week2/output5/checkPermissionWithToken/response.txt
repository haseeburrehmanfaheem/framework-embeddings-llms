Since there is no actual code provided for the `checkPermissionWithToken` method, it seems like a placeholder or an empty implementation.

In this case, I would conclude that there are no potential sinks in this API. The method does not perform any operations that could potentially leak sensitive information or require access control.

Here is an empty JSON response to reflect this:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

Please provide the actual code for the `checkPermissionWithToken` method if you'd like me to analyze it further.
