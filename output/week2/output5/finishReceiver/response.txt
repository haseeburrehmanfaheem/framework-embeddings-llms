After carefully analyzing the code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "BroadcastRecord var31 = var29.getMatchingOrderedReceiver(param2);",
        "BroadcastQueue var32 = var31.queue;",
        "boolean var35 = var32.finishReceiverLocked(var31,param3,param4,param5,param6,1);"
    ],
    [
        "Intent var82 = param2.intent;",
        "Intent var84 = var82.setComponent(0);"
    ],
    [
        "BroadcastFilter var97 = param2.curFilter;",
        "BroadcastFilter var98 = param2.curFilter;",
        "ReceiverList var99 = var98.receiverList;",
        "var99.curBroadcast = 0;"
    ]
]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind these sinks:

1. The first sink is related to the `finishReceiverLocked` method call, which has high naming similarity with the API name `finishReceiver`. This method processes the input parameters `param2`, `param3`, `param4`, `param5`, and `param6`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the receiver was finished successfully. The sink includes the instructions that collectively contribute to this method call.
2. The second sink is related to the creation of a new `Intent` object, which has naming similarity with the API name `finishReceiver`. Although this object is not returned by the API, it is used as an argument to the `setComponent` method, which modifies the intent.
3. The third sink is related to the access and modification of the `curBroadcast` field in the `ReceiverList` object. This field has naming similarity with the API name `finishReceiver`. Although this field is not returned by the API, it is accessed and modified using the `var99.curBroadcast = 0;` instruction.

Note that I have ranked these sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on system security and functionality.
