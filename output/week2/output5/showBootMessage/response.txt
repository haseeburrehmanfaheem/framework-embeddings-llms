Here is the analysis of the API `showBootMessage`:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var10.showBootMessage(param2,param3);",
      "var12.showBootMessage(param2,param3);"
    ],
    [
      "this.mShowingBootMessages = 1;"
    ],
    [
      "performEnableScreen();"
    ],
    [
      "DisplayContent var17 = getDefaultDisplayContentLocked();",
      "boolean var19 = var17.checkWaitingForWindows();"
    ],
    [
      "IBinder var41 = ServiceManager.getService(SurfaceFlinger);",
      "Parcel var47 = Parcel.obtain();",
      "var47.writeInterfaceToken(android.ui.ISurfaceComposer);",
      "boolean var51 = var41.transact(1,var47,0,0);"
    ],
    [
      "SystemProperties.set(service.bootanim.exit,1);"
    ],
    [
      "this.mBootAnimationStopped = 1;"
    ],
    [
      "this.mDisplayEnabled = 1;"
    ],
    [
      "var71.setEventDispatchingLw(var72);"
    ],
    [
      "IActivityManager var75 = this.mActivityManager;",
      "var75.bootAnimationComplete();"
    ],
    [
      "WindowManagerPolicy var79 = this.mPolicy;",
      "var79.enableScreenAfterBoot();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Each sink is ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive, with the most sensitive set at the top. The sinks are identified based on the positive rules:

1. Method invocations with naming similarity or taking input parameters as arguments.
2. Field get cases with naming similarity and used with other sink cases.
3. Field set cases with naming similarity or modified with API parameters.
4. Creation of new objects with naming similarity to the API or created with data flow from API parameters.

The sinks follow at least one of the positive rules, and do not include any comments or generic utility methods (e.g., `toString`, `isEmpty`).
