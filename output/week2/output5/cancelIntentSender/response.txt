After analyzing the provided Java code for the `cancelIntentSender` API, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "PendingIntentController var3 = this.mPendingIntentController;",
        "var3.cancelIntentSender(param2);",
        "cancelIntentSender(var6,1);"
    ],
    [
        "HashMap var6 = this.mIntentSenderRecords;",
        "Object var9 = var6.remove(var7);"
    ]
]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

The first sink is ranked higher because it directly cancels an intent sender and has a high naming similarity with the API name `cancelIntentSender`. Additionally, it processes the input parameter `param2`, which further increases its sensitivity.

The second sink is less sensitive but still requires access control as it removes an entry from the `mIntentSenderRecords` map. While this operation doesn't directly process user-provided data, it can potentially impact the internal state of the system.

Please note that I've excluded instructions related to logging, auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining a lock), and generic utility methods, as they don't meet the criteria for potential sinks according to the provided rules.
