Here is the JSON output of potential sinks in the provided Android API `startUserInBackgroundWithListener`:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserController var4 = this.mUserController;",
      "boolean var7 = var4.startUser(param2,0,param3);",
      "SparseArray var105 = this.mStartedUsers;",
      "Object var107 = var105.get(param2);",
      "UserState var108 = (UserState) var107;",
      "UserState var140 = new UserState();",
      "SparseArray var148 = this.mStartedUsers;",
      "var148.put(param2,var140);"
    ],
    [
      "WindowManagerService var96 = var94.getWindowManager();",
      "var96.startFreezingScreen(17432729,17432728);",
      "WindowManagerGlobalLock var12 = this.mGlobalLock;",
      "startFreezingDisplayLocked(param2,param3);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

The first set of sinks includes the instructions that contribute to starting a new user in the background. This includes invoking the `startUser` method on the `UserController` object, accessing and updating the `mStartedUsers` SparseArray, and creating a new `UserState` object.

The second set of sinks includes the instructions that contribute to freezing the screen during the user switching process. This includes invoking the `startFreezingScreen` method on the `WindowManagerService` object and calling the `startFreezingDisplayLocked` method with the `param2` and `param3` parameters.

Note that some variables, such as `var55`, `var57`, and `var59`, are not included in the sinks because they do not contribute to a potential sink according to the provided rules. Additionally, some methods, such as `Binder.getCallingUid()` and `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()`, are also not included because they are auxiliary operations that do not directly contribute to a potential sink.
