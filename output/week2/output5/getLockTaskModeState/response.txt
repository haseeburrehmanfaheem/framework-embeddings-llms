Here is the JSON output for the `getLockTaskModeState` API:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var4 = var2.getLockTaskModeState();",
      "int var7 = var5.getLockTaskModeState();"
    ],
    [
      "WindowManagerService.boostPriorityForLockedSection();",
      "WindowManagerService.resetPriorityAfterLockedSection();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this output:

1. The first sink set `var4 = var2.getLockTaskModeState()` and `var7 = var5.getLockTaskModeState()` are related as they both have naming similarity with the API name `getLockTaskModeState`. These two instructions collectively contribute to a sink because they retrieve sensitive information about the lock task mode state.

2. The second sink set `WindowManagerService.boostPriorityForLockedSection()` and `WindowManagerService.resetPriorityAfterLockedSection()` are related as they both modify system resources (thread priority) with API input parameters not explicitly mentioned, but can be linked to this API through data flow analysis. However, these two instructions are less sensitive compared to the first sink set.

Note: Other lines of code in the provided snippet don't contribute to a sink because either they're auxiliary operations (`var2 = this.mGlobalLock;`, `this.reset();`), generic utility methods (`int var3 = Process.myTid();`), or just storing values without any further processing (`int var4 = this.mAnimationThreadId;`, `int var5 = this.mSurfaceAnimationThreadId;`).
