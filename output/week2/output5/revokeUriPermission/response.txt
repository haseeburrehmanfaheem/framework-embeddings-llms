After analyzing the provided Java code for the `revokeUriPermission` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
"Sinks": [
    [
        "ProcessRecord var11 = getRecordForAppLocked(param2);",
        "IBinder var8 = asBinder();",
        "IApplicationThread var26 = var25.thread;",
        "IApplicationThread var27 = var25.thread;"
    ],
    [
        "SparseArray var19 = (SparseArray) var18;",
        "Object var24 = var19.valueAt(var34);",
        "ProcessRecord var25 = (ProcessRecord) var24;"
    ]
]
}
```

The identified sinks follow the positive rules as described below:

1.  The first sink set contains method invocations that have high naming similarity with the API name (`getRecordForAppLocked`, `asBinder`). These methods also process the input parameter `param2`.
2.  The second sink set contains field access cases where the accessed fields are used later in the code and have a potential impact on the API's behavior.

Note that I have excluded generic utility methods, logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, and auxiliary operations from the identified sinks, as per the provided negative rules.
