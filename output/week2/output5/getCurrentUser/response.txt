"Sinks": [

}

Explanation:
In this API, getCurrentUser, the method invocation "var2.getCurrentUser()" follows one of the positive rules: it has naming similarity with the API name. The return value of this method is also assigned to a variable (UserInfo var4) and then used in another instruction (Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo var4;), indicating that the result is being utilized.

Although there are only two relevant instructions, they together form a complete set that contributes to the sink. 

Note: Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo var4; might be an unused variable but it is still assigned with sensitive information from getCurrentUser method hence included as part of sink.

The assignment "UserController var2 = this.mUserController;" and "Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo var4;" are auxiliary operations to obtain the current user controller and declaring a local variable, respectively. Hence they do not contribute to the sink.
