After analyzing the provided Java code for the `getFilteredTasks` API, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var7 = var5.getFilteredTasks(param2,param3,param4);",
      "ArrayList var33 = new ArrayList();",
      "RootActivityContainer var40 = this.mRootActivityContainer;",
      "var40.getRunningTasks(param2,var33,param3,param4,var6,var39,var10,var18);"
    ],
    [
      "TaskRecord var50 = (TaskRecord) var49;",
      "ActivityManager$RunningTaskInfo var52 = createRunningTaskInfo(var50);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first set of sinks is related to the `getFilteredTasks` method invocation, which returns a list of tasks. The `ArrayList` creation and the subsequent call to `getRunningTasks` on the `RootActivityContainer` instance are part of this sink. This set follows the positive rule of having naming similarity with the API name (`getFilteredTasks`) and taking input parameters as arguments.

The second set of sinks is related to the creation of a `TaskRecord` object and its subsequent use in creating an `ActivityManager$RunningTaskInfo` object. This set follows the positive rule of having data flow from the API parameters through to the created objects.

Note that I have excluded certain lines of code, such as logging statements, auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining instances of classes), and generic utility methods (e.g., `Binder.getCallingUid()`), as they do not meet the criteria for potential sinks.
