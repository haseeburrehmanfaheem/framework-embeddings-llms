Since the provided code snippet does not contain any method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that follow the positive rules for identifying sinks, there are no potential sinks in this API.

However, I must note that the method `checkPermission` is declared to return `void`, but it's likely that a permission check would typically involve some kind of return value or exception being thrown. The provided code snippet seems incomplete, as it doesn't perform any actual permission checking.

If you provide more complete code for this API, I'd be happy to help identify potential sinks. But based on the current snippet, there are no identifiable sinks.

Here's an empty JSON response to reflect this:

```
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```
