Based on the provided Java code for the `getAllStackInfos` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with ranked sink sets:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ActivityManager$StackInfo var6 = new ActivityManager$StackInfo();",
      "var6.displayId = var3;",
      "var6.stackId = var10;",
      "var6.userId = var11;",
      "boolean var14 = shouldBeVisible(0);",
      "var6.visible = var14;",
      "var6.position = var17;",
      "Configuration var20 = var6.configuration;",
      "Configuration var22 = getConfiguration();",
      "var20.setTo(var22);"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayList var25 = getAllTasks();",
      "int var27 = var25.size();",
      "[I var28 = new [I(var27);",
      "String var29 = new String(var27);",
      "Rect var30 = new Rect(var27);",
      "[I var31 = new [I(var27);",
      "var6.taskIds = var28;",
      "var6.taskNames = var29;",
      "var6.taskBounds = var30;",
      "var6.taskUserIds = var31;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink set is ranked higher because it involves creating a new `ActivityManager$StackInfo` object and setting its properties, including the display ID, stack ID, user ID, visibility, and position. These actions are critical to the API's functionality and require access control.

The second sink set involves retrieving task information from the `getAllTasks` method and storing it in various arrays. While this data may be sensitive, it is not as critical to the API's core functionality as the first sink set.

Note that both sink sets follow at least one of the positive rules (e.g., creating a new object with data flow from the API parameters) and do not involve generic utility methods, logging methods, or auxiliary operations.
