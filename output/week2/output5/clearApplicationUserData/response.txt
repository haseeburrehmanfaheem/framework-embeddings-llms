Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `clearApplicationUserData`, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the ranked list of sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "PackageManagerInternal var26 = getPackageManagerInternalLocked();",
      "boolean var28 = var26.isPackageDataProtected(var16,param2);",
      "ApplicationInfo var42 = var20.getApplicationInfo(param2,8192,var16);",
      "int var47 = var45.uid;",
      "forceStopPackageLocked(param2,var107,clear data);"
    ],
    [
      "ProcessList var86 = this.mProcessList;",
      "boolean var107 = var86.killPackageProcessesLocked(param2,var29,param9,-10000,param4,1,param6,param7,1,var105);"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayList var12 = new ArrayList();",
      "ProcessList$MyProcessMap var14 = this.mProcessNames;",
      "ArrayMap var16 = var14.getMap();",
      "Object var26 = var24.valueAt(var81);",
      "SparseArray var27 = (SparseArray) var26;",
      "Object var31 = var27.valueAt(var75);",
      "ProcessRecord var32 = (ProcessRecord) var31;",
      "var32.removed = 1;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on the system. The first sink involves accessing and manipulating package data, which is a critical operation that requires careful access control. The second sink involves killing package processes, which can have significant implications for the system's performance and security. The third sink involves updating process records, which may not be as sensitive but still requires proper access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.
