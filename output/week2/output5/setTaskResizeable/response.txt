Based on the provided code, I have identified potential sinks in the `setTaskResizeable` API. Here is the JSON output:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var4.setTaskResizeable(param2,param3);",
      "TaskRecord var9 = var6.anyTaskForId(param2,1);",
      "TaskRecord var6 = anyTaskForId(param2,param3,0,0);"
    ],
    [
      "ActivityStack var23 = var18.getChildAt(var28);",
      "TaskRecord var25 = var23.taskForIdLocked(param2);",
      "boolean var50 = var25.reparent(var46,param5,var47,1,1,anyTaskForId);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

**Sink 1:** The first set of instructions contributes to a sink because it involves the `setTaskResizeable` method being called on an object (`var4`) that has naming similarity with the API name. Additionally, this method processes the input parameters `param2` and `param3`. The subsequent lines retrieve TaskRecord objects using these input parameters.

**Sink 2:** The second set of instructions contributes to a sink because it involves accessing a TaskRecord object (`var25`) using the input parameter `param2`. This object is then used in a reparenting operation, which may imply a change in its state or behavior.
