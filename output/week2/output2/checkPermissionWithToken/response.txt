Here is the analysis of the provided Java code:

```java
public void checkPermissionWithToken() {
    int -1;
}
```

Upon examining the code, it's clear that there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows within this API. The variable `int -1` is a simple declaration and doesn't contribute to any sensitive operation.

Based on the provided rules for identifying sinks, I couldn't find any instructions that collectively contribute to a sink in the given Java code.

Here's an empty JSON response:

```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```

Reasoning:
- The API `checkPermissionWithToken` doesn't perform any sensitive operation.
- There are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows within this API that could potentially contribute to a sink.

Note: Given the lack of any meaningful operations in the provided code, it's possible that the code is incomplete or an example snippet rather than actual production code.
