Based on the provided Java code for the `getCurrentUser` API, here is the analysis of potential sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserController var2 = this.mUserController;",
      "UserInfo var4 = var2.getCurrentUser();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking: High sensitivity

Reasoning:
- The `getCurrentUser` API invokes the `getCurrentUser` method on the `UserController` object, which has a high naming similarity with the API name.
- The return value of `var2.getCurrentUser()` is assigned to `var4`, indicating that the result of this method invocation is used and potentially returned by the API.

Note: Although the API does not explicitly return the `UserInfo` object, it's likely that the result is being processed or stored for later use. Hence, I've considered it as a potential sink.

In terms of sensitivity ranking, I've ranked this sink as high because it deals with user information, which is typically sensitive data.
