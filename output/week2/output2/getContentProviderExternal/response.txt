Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `getContentProviderExternal`, I have identified two potential sets of sinks that require access control. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ContentProviderHolder var25 = getContentProviderExternalUnchecked(param2,param4,var20,var23,var18);",
      "ContentProviderHolder var10 = getContentProviderImpl(0,param2,param3,param4,0,param5,1,param6);"
    ],
    [
      "ContentProviderHolder var1131 = var99.newHolder(0);",
      "ContentProviderHolder var3 = new ContentProviderHolder();",
      "var3.provider = var6;",
      "var3.noReleaseNeeded = var7;",
      "var3.connection = param2;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first set of sinks (`getContentProviderExternalUnchecked` and `getContentProviderImpl`) is more sensitive because it involves retrieving a content provider holder with specific parameters, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or data exposure.
2. The second set of sinks (`var99.newHolder`, creating a new `ContentProviderHolder` object, and setting its properties) is less sensitive but still requires attention as it involves creating a new holder for the content provider.

Reasoning:

* Both sets of sinks follow at least one positive rule:
	+ The first set has method invocations with naming similarity to the API name (`getContentProviderExternalUnchecked` and `getContentProviderImpl`) and processes input parameters (`param2`, `param4`, `var20`, `var23`, and `var18`).
	+ The second set creates a new object (`ContentProviderHolder`) with data flow from the API parameters (`var6`, `var7`, and `param2`) and has method invocations with naming similarity to the API name (`newHolder`).
* Both sets of sinks do not follow any negative rules (e.g., generic utility methods, logging methods, input validation/sanity checks, or auxiliary operations).
