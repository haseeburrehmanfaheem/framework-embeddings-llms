Based on the provided Java code for the `forceStopPackage` API, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var49.setPackageStoppedState(param2,1,var60);",
      "UserController var97 = this.mUserController;",
      "forceStopPackageLocked(param2,var70,var119);"
    ],
    [
      "ProcessList var86 = this.mProcessList;",
      "boolean var107 = var86.killPackageProcessesLocked(param2,var29,param9,-10000,param4,1,param6,param7,1,var105);"
    ],
    [
      "ArrayList var12 = new ArrayList();",
      "var12.add(var32);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink set is the most sensitive as it involves stopping a package and killing its processes, which can have significant implications on the system's security and functionality.
2. The second sink set is less sensitive but still critical as it kills package processes, which can affect the system's performance and stability.
3. The third sink set is the least sensitive as it only adds a process record to an array list, which does not directly impact the system's security or functionality.

Reasoning for each sink:

1. The first sink set involves stopping a package and killing its processes, which requires access control to prevent unauthorized packages from being stopped or killed.
2. The second sink set kills package processes, which also requires access control to prevent unauthorized processes from being killed.
3. The third sink set adds a process record to an array list, which may not directly impact the system's security or functionality but still requires access control to prevent unauthorized modifications to the list.

Note that these sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

* Method invocations with naming similarity (e.g., `forceStopPackageLocked`)
* Field set cases with naming similarity (e.g., `var49.setPackageStoppedState`)
* Creation of new objects with data flow from API parameters (e.g., `ArrayList var12 = new ArrayList();`)
