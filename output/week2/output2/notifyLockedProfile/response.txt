Here is the JSON response:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ActivityTaskManagerInternal var3 = this.mAtmInternal;",
      "int var6 = var4.getCurrentUserId();",
      "var3.notifyLockedProfile(param2, var6);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking: High sensitivity

Reasoning:

1. The `notifyLockedProfile` method invocation is a sink because it has high naming similarity with the API name `notifyLockedProfile`. It also processes the internal field `param2` and the return value of another method `getCurrentUserId()`.
2. The `ActivityTaskManagerInternal var3 = this.mAtmInternal;` line is part of the sink set because it initializes an object that is later used to invoke the `notifyLockedProfile` method.
3. The `int var6 = var4.getCurrentUserId();` line is also part of the sink set because its return value is used as a parameter in the `notifyLockedProfile` method invocation.

The sensitivity ranking is high because this API appears to be related to user profiles and notification, which could potentially contain sensitive information.
