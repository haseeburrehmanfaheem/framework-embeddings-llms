Based on the provided Java code, I identified two potential sink sets that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var14.shutdown();",
      "writeState();"
    ],
    [
      "FastXmlSerializer var22 = new FastXmlSerializer();",
      "var22.setOutput(var5, var26);",
      "Boolean var30 = Boolean.valueOf(1);",
      "var22.startDocument(0, var30);",
      "XmlSerializer var34 = var22.startTag(0, app-ops);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sink sets from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink set is more sensitive as it involves shutting down the `AppOpsService` and writing state data, which could potentially impact system security or functionality.
2. The second sink set is less sensitive but still important, as it creates an XML serializer object and starts a document, which may involve accessing sensitive data.

Reasoning for each sink:

1. The first sink set:
   - `var14.shutdown();` has high naming similarity with the API name `shutdown`.
   - `writeState();` is invoked in the same method and contributes to writing state data.
2. The second sink set:
   - `FastXmlSerializer var22 = new FastXmlSerializer();` creates a new object that will be used for serialization.
   - `var22.setOutput(var5, var26);`, `Boolean var30 = Boolean.valueOf(1);`, `var22.startDocument(0, var30);`, and `XmlSerializer var34 = var22.startTag(0, app-ops);` all contribute to the XML serialization process.

Note that I excluded certain lines of code from the sink sets because they did not meet the positive rules or were part of auxiliary operations (e.g., logging, getting context objects).
