After carefully analyzing the provided Java code for the `getFilteredTasks` API, I have identified several potential sinks that may require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var7 = var5.getFilteredTasks(param2,param3,param4);",
      "ActivityTaskManagerService var5 = this.mActivityTaskManager;",
      "RootActivityContainer var40 = this.mRootActivityContainer;",
      "var40.getRunningTasks(param2,var33,param3,param4,var6,var39,var10,var18);"
    ],
    [
      "TaskRecord var50 = (TaskRecord) var49;",
      "ActivityManager$RunningTaskInfo var52 = createRunningTaskInfo(var50);",
      "Iterator var45 = var43.iterator();",
      "Object var49 = var45.next();",
      "TreeSet var12 = this.mTmpSortedSet;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink is related to the `getFilteredTasks` method call, which returns a list of tasks filtered by the input parameters. The second sink is related to the creation of `ActivityManager$RunningTaskInfo` objects using the `createRunningTaskInfo` method.

Both sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

1. Method invocation with naming similarity (e.g., `getFilteredTasks`, `createRunningTaskInfo`)
2. Data flow from input parameters (e.g., `param2`, `param3`, `param4`) to the sink
3. Creation of new objects with data flow from input parameters

These sinks are ranked in order of sensitivity, with the first sink being more sensitive due to its direct involvement with the API's primary function (`getFilteredTasks`). The second sink is less sensitive but still potentially vulnerable as it creates `ActivityManager$RunningTaskInfo` objects that may contain sensitive information.
