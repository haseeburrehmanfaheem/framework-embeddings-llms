The provided code is quite lengthy, but after carefully examining it, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object var7 = new Object(8);",
      "arraystore 7[12] = 11;",
      "arraystore 7[19] = 18;",
      "arraystore 7[20] = 4;",
      "arraystore 7[27] = 26;",
      "arraystore 7[28] = 29;",
      "arraystore 7[30] = 31;",
      "arraystore 7[32] = 33;",
      "arraystore 7[34] = 37;"
    ],
    [
      "addErrorToDropBox(param2, param3, param4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, param5);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The first sink is related to the creation of a new `Object` and storing various values in it. The instructions that contribute to this sink are listed above.

The second sink is related to adding an error to the drop box using the `addErrorToDropBox` method. This method invocation has high naming similarity with the API name `handleApplicationCrash`, which indicates a potential security concern.

Note that I have excluded various logging statements, input validation checks, and auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining an instance of a class) as they are not considered sinks according to the provided rules.
