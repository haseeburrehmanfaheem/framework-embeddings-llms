Here is the JSON output for the `getConfiguration` API:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Configuration var4 = var2.getConfiguration();",
      "Configuration var6 = getGlobalConfigurationForCallingPid();",
      "Configuration var5 = getGlobalConfigurationForPid(var3);",
      "Configuration var11 = getGlobalConfiguration();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this output:

* The API `getConfiguration` does not explicitly return a value, but it accesses and updates various configuration objects.
* The instructions that contribute to the sink are those that access or update configuration objects with high naming similarity to the API name (`var4`, `var6`, `var5`, and `var11`).
* These configurations are obtained through method invocations (`getConfiguration()`, `getGlobalConfigurationForCallingPid()`, `getGlobalConfigurationForPid(var3)`) that process the input parameter `param2` indirectly.
* The creation of a new `Configuration` object is not directly used as a sink, but it's likely an auxiliary operation to create a default configuration.

Note that there are no other instructions in the provided code snippet that match the positive rules for identifying sinks.
