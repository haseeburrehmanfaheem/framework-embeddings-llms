Based on the provided Java code for the `finishReceiver` API, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "param2.receiver = 0;",
      "Intent var82 = param2.intent;",
      "Intent var84 = var82.setComponent(0);",
      "ProcessRecord var85 = param2.curApp;",
      "ProcessRecord var86 = param2.curApp;",
      "ArraySet var87 = var86.curReceivers;",
      "boolean var89 = var87.contains(param2);",
      "ProcessRecord var90 = param2.curApp;",
      "ArraySet var91 = var90.curReceivers;",
      "boolean var93 = var91.remove(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "BroadcastFilter var97 = param2.curFilter;",
      "BroadcastFilter var98 = param2.curFilter;",
      "ReceiverList var99 = var98.receiverList;",
      "var99.curBroadcast = 0;"
    ],
    [
      "param2.curFilter = 0;",
      "param2.curReceiver = 0;",
      "param2.curApp = 0;",
      "this.mPendingBroadcast = 0;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on the potential impact of unauthorized access.

**Sink 1:** This sink is related to the `receiver` object and its associated components. The code sets the `receiver` field to 0, updates the `intent` object, and removes the receiver from the `curReceivers` set. This sink has high sensitivity as it involves modifying sensitive objects and data structures.

**Sink 2:** This sink is related to the `curFilter` object and its associated components. The code sets the `curFilter` field to 0 and updates the `receiverList` object. This sink has moderate sensitivity as it involves modifying sensitive objects and data structures, but with less potential impact than Sink 1.

**Sink 3:** This sink is related to resetting various fields and objects, including `curFilter`, `curReceiver`, `curApp`, and `mPendingBroadcast`. This sink has low sensitivity as it primarily involves resetting internal state variables, which may not have a significant impact on the system's security or functionality.

Note that these sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

* Method invocations with naming similarity to the API name (`finishReceiver`)
* Field get/set cases with naming similarity to the API name (`receiver`, `curFilter`, etc.)
* Creation of new objects with data flow from API parameters (e.g., `Intent` object creation)
