Based on the provided Java code for the `isAppStartModeDisabled` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var9 = getAppStartModeLocked(param2,param3,0,-1,0,1,0);",
      "boolean var17 = isOnDeviceIdleWhitelistLocked(param2,1);"
    ],
    [
      "UidRecord var11 = this.mProcessList.getUidRecordLocked(param2);",
      "boolean var13 = var11.idle;"
    ],
    [
      "PackageManagerInternal var16 = getPackageManagerInternalLocked();",
      "boolean var20 = var16.isPackageEphemeral(var18,param3);"
    ],
    [
      "int var27 = appRestrictedInBackgroundLocked(param2,param3,param4);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink set:

1. The first sink set includes the `getAppStartModeLocked` and `isOnDeviceIdleWhitelistLocked` method calls, which have naming similarity with the API name and process input parameters.
2. The second sink set involves accessing the `mProcessList` field and retrieving a `UidRecord` object using the `getUidRecordLocked` method, followed by accessing the `idle` field of the `UidRecord` object.
3. The third sink set includes getting an instance of `PackageManagerInternal` using the `getPackageManagerInternalLocked` method and then calling the `isPackageEphemeral` method on it, passing input parameters.
4. The fourth sink set consists of a single instruction, which calls the `appRestrictedInBackgroundLocked` method with input parameters.

Note that I've excluded certain instructions from the analysis, such as logging statements, auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining an instance of a class), and generic utility methods (e.g., `UserHandle.getAppId`). These exclusions are based on the negative rules provided.
