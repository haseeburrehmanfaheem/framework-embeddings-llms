Here is the JSON output with potential sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "param2.availMem = var10;",
      "param2.totalMem = var12;",
      "param2.threshold = var5;",
      "param2.lowMemory = var21;",
      "param2.hiddenAppThreshold = var8;",
      "param2.secondaryServerThreshold = var24;",
      "param2.visibleAppThreshold = var27;",
      "param2.foregroundAppThreshold = var29;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

* The API `getMemoryInfo` returns memory-related information in the form of assignments to `param2`.
* All field assignment instructions (`=`) for `param2` are considered a single sink because they collectively contribute to returning sensitive information.
* This set follows the positive rule "Field set cases, which have naming similarity with the API name" and also follow the rule "they are modified with the API parameters".
* Note that `var21` is not defined in this snippet, but assuming it's a variable related to memory info, I've included it as part of the sink.
