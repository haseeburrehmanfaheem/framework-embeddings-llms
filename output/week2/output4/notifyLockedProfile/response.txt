Here is the analysis of the provided API code:

The API `notifyLockedProfile` does not return any value, but it invokes an inner method `notifyLockedProfile` on the object `var3`, which has a high naming similarity with the API name. 

Additionally, this invoked method processes the input parameter `param2` (not defined in the provided snippet) and the locally obtained user ID `var6`. This indicates that the invoked method is likely to be a sink.

Here are the identified sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ActivityTaskManagerInternal var3 = this.mAtmInternal;",
      "UserController var4 = this.mUserController;",
      "int var6 = var4.getCurrentUserId();",
      "var3.notifyLockedProfile(param2,var6);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Note that there is only one sink identified in the provided code snippet.
