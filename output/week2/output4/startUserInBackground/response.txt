Based on the provided code, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON representation of these sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserState var140 = new UserState();",
      "var148.put(param2,var140);"
    ],
    [
      "UserInfo var85 = getUserInfo(param2);",
      "boolean var87 = var85.isManagedProfile();",
      "boolean var91 = var85.preCreated;"
    ],
    [
      "UserController$Injector var195 = this.mInjector;",
      "UserManagerInternal var197 = var195.getUserManagerInternal();"
    ],
    [
      "int var198 = var163.state;",
      "var197.setUserState(param2,var198);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

1. The first sink involves the creation of a new `UserState` object and its subsequent storage in the `mStartedUsers` array. This is considered sensitive as it may contain user-specific data.

2. The second sink revolves around retrieving information about a specific user using `getUserInfo(param2)` and then accessing certain properties of that user (e.g., whether they have a managed profile or are pre-created).

3. The third sink involves obtaining an instance of `UserManagerInternal` through the injector, which may provide sensitive functionality related to user management.

4. The fourth sink involves setting the state of a specific user using `setUserState(param2,var198)`. This could potentially allow unauthorized modifications to user data or settings.

Each of these sinks has been ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on their potential impact on user data and system security.
