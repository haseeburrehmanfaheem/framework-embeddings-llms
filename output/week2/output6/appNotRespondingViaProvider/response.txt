Here is the JSON output for the API `appNotRespondingViaProvider`:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ActivityManagerService$MainHandler var11 = this.mHandler;",
      "ActivityManagerService$14 var12 = new ActivityManagerService$14();",
      "boolean var15 = var11.post(var12);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The identified sink is the posting of a message to the `ActivityManagerService$MainHandler` handler, which is triggered by creating a new instance of `ActivityManagerService$14`. The dataflow link between these instructions is that the creation of `var12` directly influences the input to the `post` method.

This sink follows the positive rule for object creation with naming similarity to the API (`ActivityManagerService$14` has a naming similarity with `ActivityManagerService`). Additionally, the `post` method invocation meets the criteria for a potential sink as it processes data that may be related to the API's purpose (app not responding).
