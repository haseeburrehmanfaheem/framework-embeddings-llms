After analyzing the provided Java code for the Android API `getFilteredTasks`, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here are the results in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "List var7 = var5.getFilteredTasks(param2,param3,param4);",
      "RootActivityContainer var40 = this.mRootActivityContainer;",
      "var40.getRunningTasks(param2,var33,param3,param4,var6,var39,var10,var18);"
    ],
    [
      "UserManagerService var12 = getUserManager();",
      "int var14 = UserHandle.getUserId(var6);",
      "[I var17 = var12.getProfileIds(var14,1);"
    ],
    [
      "RunningTasks var11 = var10.mRunningTasks;",
      "var11.getTasks(param2,param3,param4,param5,var12,param6,param7,param8,param9);"
    ],
    [
      "TaskRecord var50 = (TaskRecord) var49;",
      "ActivityManager$RunningTaskInfo var52 = createRunningTaskInfo(var50);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each sink:

1. The first sink involves the `getFilteredTasks` method call, which returns a list of tasks that are filtered based on the input parameters `param2`, `param3`, and `param4`. This data is then passed to the `getRunningTasks` method of the `RootActivityContainer` class, potentially revealing sensitive information about running tasks.
2. The second sink involves the `getUserManager` method call, which returns a `UserManagerService` object. This object is used to retrieve profile IDs associated with the calling user ID (`var6`). This data could be used to infer sensitive information about the user's profiles.
3. The third sink involves the `getRunningTasks` method call of the `RootActivityContainer` class, which returns a list of running tasks. This data is then passed to the `getTasks` method of the `RunningTasks` class, potentially revealing sensitive information about running tasks and their associated users.
4. The fourth sink involves the creation of an `ActivityManager$RunningTaskInfo` object using the `createRunningTaskInfo` method. This object contains sensitive information about a running task, including its ID, user ID, and other details.

These sinks are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive based on the potential impact of revealing sensitive information about running tasks, users, and their profiles.
