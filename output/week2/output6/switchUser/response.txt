After analyzing the provided code for the `switchUser` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "boolean var5 = var3.switchUser(param2);",
      "UserInfo var8 = getUserInfo(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "int var6 = getCurrentUserId();",
      "UserInfo var28 = getUserInfo(var6);"
    ],
    [
      "Pair var29 = new Pair();",
      "Message var37 = var35.obtainMessage(1000,var29);",
      "boolean var39 = var34.sendMessage(var37);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The ranking is based on the sensitivity of the sinks, with the most sensitive ones first. Here's a brief explanation for each sink:

1. The first sink involves calling `switchUser` and retrieving `UserInfo` using the provided `param2`. This suggests that the API is switching to a new user and obtaining information about that user. The method call and field access have high naming similarity with the API name, and they process the input parameter `param2`.

2. The second sink involves getting the current user ID and retrieving `UserInfo` using that ID. While this does not directly involve the input parameters, it is related to the overall functionality of switching users.

3. The third sink involves creating a new `Pair` object and sending a message with it. Although this does not have direct naming similarity or obvious connections to the API parameters, the creation of the `Pair` object and its use in sending a message could potentially be used to propagate sensitive information.

Note that some instructions, such as accessing fields like `this.mUserController`, `this.mInjector`, `ServiceManager.getService(user)`, etc., are not included in the sinks because they do not meet the positive rules (e.g., no naming similarity with the API name and no clear data flow link to other instructions). Additionally, some variables, such as `var12` and `var14`, which involve checking if a user supports switching or is a managed profile, are also not included in the sinks for similar reasons.
