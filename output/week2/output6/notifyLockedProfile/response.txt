Here is the analysis of the `notifyLockedProfile` API:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ActivityTaskManagerInternal var3 = this.mAtmInternal;",
      "int var6 = this.mUserController.getCurrentUserId();",
      "var3.notifyLockedProfile(param2, var6);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The API `notifyLockedProfile` invokes the method `notifyLockedProfile` of `ActivityTaskManagerInternal`, passing `param2` and the current user ID as arguments.
- This internal method invocation follows the positive rule where it has naming similarity with the API name `notifyLockedProfile`.
- Additionally, the input parameter `param2` is used directly in the invoked method, further establishing a clear data flow link.

Note that there's only one potential sink identified, which involves the invocation of the internal method and its direct use of the current user ID.
