Based on the provided Java code for the `handleApplicationStrictModeViolation` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with ranked sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "AppErrorResult var46 = new AppErrorResult();",
      "var52.obj = var54;",
      "Handler var65 = this.mUiHandler;",
      "boolean var67 = var65.sendMessage(var52);"
    ],
    [
      "ProcessRecord var7 = findAppProcess(param2,StrictMode);",
      "Object var61 = var54.put(app,var7);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking explanation:

1. The first sink is ranked higher as it involves the creation of a new `AppErrorResult` object (`var46`) and its transmission through a message (`var52.obj`) to the `mUiHandler`. This represents a potential sensitive data flow.
2. The second sink involves accessing the `ProcessRecord` instance (`var7`) and storing it in a map (`var54`). Although this sink involves accessing internal state, it is ranked lower as it does not directly contribute to a sensitive data transmission or creation.

Note that both sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

1. The first sink involves creating a new object (`AppErrorResult`) with data flow from the API parameters (`param4`).
2. The second sink involves accessing an internal field (`findAppProcess`) with high naming similarity to the API name (`handleApplicationStrictModeViolation`).
