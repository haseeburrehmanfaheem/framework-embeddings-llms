Since the provided code snippet does not contain any method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that follow the positive rules for identifying sinks, I conclude that there are no potential sinks in this API.

However, to adhere to the requested format, here is an empty JSON response:

```json
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```

This indicates that no potential sinks were identified in the provided code snippet.
