Here is the JSON output of potential sinks in the given code:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "BroadcastRecord var13 = var12.curBroadcast;",
      "var17.finishReceiverLocked(var13, var18, var19, var20, var21, 0);"
    ],
    [
      "Intent var82 = param2.intent;",
      "param2.resultData = param4;"
    ],
    [
      "ProcessRecord var40 = param2.curApp;",
      "var40.removeAllowBackgroundActivityStartsToken(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "BroadcastDispatcher$Deferrals var11 = new BroadcastDispatcher$Deferrals();",
      "BroadcastDispatcher.insertLocked(var22, var11);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The sinks identified here are related to broadcasting and receiver handling. The first sink involves finishing the receiver locked with the broadcast record `var13`. The second sink is related to setting the result data of the intent `param2.intent` to `param4`. The third sink involves removing an allow background activity starts token from a process record `param2.curApp`. The fourth sink creates a new deferrals object and inserts it into the deferred broadcasts list.

Note that these sinks are ranked in order of their sensitivity, with the most sensitive ones first.
