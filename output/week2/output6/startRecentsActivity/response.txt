Here is the JSON output of potential sinks in the `startRecentsActivity` API:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var24 = new RecentsAnimation();",
      "var24.preloadRecentsActivity();"
    ],
    [
      "Message var76 = PooledLambda.obtainMessage(var63,var65,var66,var68,var70,activity,var74);",
      "boolean var80 = var78.sendMessage(var76);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The first sink set is the creation of a new `RecentsAnimation` object (`var24`) and its subsequent method invocation (`preloadRecentsActivity()`). This meets the positive rule for creating objects with naming similarity to the API.

2. The second sink set involves the creation of a new `Message` object (`var76`) that is subsequently sent using `sendMessage()`. The message contains sensitive data, such as the process name, intent component, and activity information, which makes it a potential sink.

Note: Other instructions in the code snippet are either auxiliary operations (e.g., obtaining context objects or accessing internal fields) or logging statements, which do not meet the criteria for sinks.
