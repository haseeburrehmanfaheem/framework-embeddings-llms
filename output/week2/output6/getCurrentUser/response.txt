Based on the provided code, here is the identified sink in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "UserInfo var4 = var2.getCurrentUser();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Reasoning:
- The getCurrentUser() method invokes another inner method getCurrentUser(), which returns a UserInfo object.
- This UserInfo object has high naming similarity with the API name getCurrentUser, indicating that it is likely a sensitive data sink.

Note: 
- Although var4 is declared twice (UserInfo and Landroid/content/pm/UserInfo), only the first declaration contributes to the sink. The second declaration seems to be an error in the code snippet provided.
- Since there are no other potential sinks identified in this API, there's only one array in 'Sinks'.
