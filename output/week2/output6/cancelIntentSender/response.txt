Based on the provided code for the `cancelIntentSender` API, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the ranked sinks:

```
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var3.cancelIntentSender(param2);",  
      "PendingIntentRecord var6 = (PendingIntentRecord) param2;",
      "cancelIntentSender(var6,1);",
      "makeIntentSenderCanceled(param2);",
      "param2.canceled = 1;"
    ],
    [
      "HashMap var6 = this.mIntentSenderRecords;",
      "Object var9 = var6.remove(var7);"
    ],
    [
      "Message var18 = PooledLambda.obtainMessage(var13,this,var15,var16);",
      "Handler var19 = this.mH;",
      "boolean var21 = var19.sendMessage(var18);"
    ],
    [
      "RemoteCallbackList var5 = detachCancelListenersLocked();",
      "Message var9 = PooledLambda.obtainMessage(var7,this,var5);",
      "Handler var10 = this.mH;",
      "boolean var12 = var10.sendMessage(var9);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The ranking is based on the sensitivity of the sinks, with the most sensitive at the top. The first sink set involves canceling an intent sender and updating the corresponding record, which requires access control to prevent unauthorized cancellation.

The second sink set involves removing a record from a hashmap, which could potentially be used to manipulate the state of the system.

The third and fourth sink sets involve sending messages using handlers, which could potentially be used to execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive information. However, they are ranked lower in terms of sensitivity since they do not directly involve modifying system state or accessing sensitive data.
