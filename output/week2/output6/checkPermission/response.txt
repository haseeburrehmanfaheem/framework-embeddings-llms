Since the provided code snippet does not contain enough information to identify potential sinks, I will assume that this is a partial code and analyze it based on the given rules.

However, there are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows in this code snippet. The variable `var9` is declared but not used anywhere in the provided code.

Therefore, there are no potential sinks to report:

```
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```
