After analyzing the provided Java code, I did not find any potential sinks that require access control.

The method `checkPermissionWithToken` is empty and does not perform any operations that could be considered a sink. It only declares an integer variable with a value of -1 but does not use it anywhere in the method.

Since there are no instructions that collectively contribute to a sink, I will provide an empty JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

There is no ranking required as there are no sinks identified.
