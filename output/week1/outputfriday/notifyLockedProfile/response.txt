After analyzing the provided Java code for the `notifyLockedProfile` method, I identified one potential sink. Here is the JSON output with the relevant code and my reasoning:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var3.notifyLockedProfile(param2,var6);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking: High sensitivity

Reasoning:
The `notifyLockedProfile` method invocation is a potential sink because it takes an API input parameter (`param2`) as an argument and processes the current user ID obtained from the `UserController`. This method call has high naming similarity with the API name, indicating that it might be performing a critical operation related to profile locking.

Although `var6 = var4.getCurrentUserId();` is not directly contributing to the sink, it's worth noting that this line retrieves the current user ID and assigns it to `var6`, which is then passed as an argument to the `notifyLockedProfile` method. However, since it's not a direct contributor to the sink (i.e., not a method invocation or field access/update), I did not include it in the JSON output.

The other lines of code are auxiliary operations (obtaining instances of classes and accessing context objects) and do not contribute to potential sinks.
