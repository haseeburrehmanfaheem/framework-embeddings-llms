After analyzing the provided Java code, I found that there are no potential sinks in this API. The method `checkPermission()` is empty and does not perform any operations that could contribute to a sink.

However, it's worth noting that the method name `checkPermission()` suggests that it might be related to permission checking, which is a security-sensitive operation. But without any actual code inside the method, there are no potential sinks to identify.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

Since there are no sinks identified, there's no need to rank them by sensitivity.

Reasoning:
The provided Java code only contains an empty method `checkPermission()` with a single variable declaration. There are no method invocations, field accesses or updates, object creations, or data flows that could contribute to a sink. Therefore, this API does not contain any potential sinks that require access control.
