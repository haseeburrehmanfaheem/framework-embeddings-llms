Here is the JSON output for the potential sinks in the provided API:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var4.registerIntentSenderCancelListener(param2,param3);",
      "PendingIntentRecord var7 = (PendingIntentRecord) param2;",
      "var7.registerCancelListenerLocked(param3);"
    ],
    [
      "RemoteCallbackList var8 = this.mCancelCallbacks;",
      "boolean var10 = var8.register(param2);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink is more sensitive because it involves registering an intent sender cancel listener, which can potentially expose sensitive information about the app's pending intents.
2. The second sink is less sensitive as it only registers a callback for cancel events.

Reasoning:

* In the first sink, `var4.registerIntentSenderCancelListener(param2,param3)` invokes a method that has naming similarity with the API name `registerIntentSenderCancelListener`, indicating a potential sink.
* Additionally, `PendingIntentRecord var7 = (PendingIntentRecord) param2` and `var7.registerCancelListenerLocked(param3)` show that data from the parameter `param2` is being used to register a cancel listener. This follows the rule of using API parameters as arguments.
* In the second sink, while `RemoteCallbackList var8 = this.mCancelCallbacks` does not directly follow any positive rules, `boolean var10 = var8.register(param2)` shows that data from parameter `param2` is being used to register a callback. However, since it's just registering a callback without exposing any sensitive information, it's considered less sensitive.

Note: The instruction "4 = instanceof 2 <Application,Lcom/android/server/am/PendingIntentRecord>;" does not contribute to the sink as it's only checking the instance type of `param2`.
