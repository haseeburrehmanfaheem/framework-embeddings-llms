After analyzing the provided Java code, I have identified potential sinks that require access control.

Here is the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    []
  ]
}
```

There are no instructions in the `checkPermission` method that collectively contribute to a sink. The method only declares an integer variable `var9`, but does not perform any operations that could be considered as sinks.

However, it's worth noting that the method name `checkPermission` suggests that it might be related to permission checking, which is a security-sensitive operation. But without more context or code, we cannot determine if this method is actually performing any sensitive operations.

If you provide more code or context about how this method is used, I can re-evaluate and provide a more accurate assessment.
