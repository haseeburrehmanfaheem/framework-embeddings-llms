After analyzing the provided Java code, I have identified no potential sinks that require access control.

The method `checkPermissionWithToken()` is empty and does not contain any instructions that match the positive rules for identifying potential sinks. The variable declaration `int -1;` is a simple statement that does not interact with sensitive data or perform any operations that could be considered a sink.

Therefore, the JSON output is:

```
{
    "Sinks": []
}
```

Since there are no identified sinks, there is no ranking of sensitivity to provide.
