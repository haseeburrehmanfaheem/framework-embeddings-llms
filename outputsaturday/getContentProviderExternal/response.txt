After carefully analyzing the provided Java code for the Android API `getContentProviderExternal`, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "ContentProviderHolder var25 = getContentProviderExternalUnchecked(param2, param4, var20, var23, var18);",
      "ContentProviderHolder var10 = getContentProviderImpl(0, param2, param3, param4, 0, param5, 1, param6);",
      "var3.provider = var6;",
      "var3.noReleaseNeeded = var7;",
      "var3.connection = param2;"
    ],
    [
      "ProcessRecord var15 = getRecordForAppLocked(param2);",
      "appDiedLocked(var114);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink is the most sensitive as it involves creating a new `ContentProviderHolder` object and setting its properties using API input parameters (`param2`, `param4`, `var20`, `var23`, and `var18`). This could potentially lead to information disclosure or unauthorized access to content providers.
2. The second sink is less sensitive but still important as it involves accessing a `ProcessRecord` object and calling the `appDiedLocked` method on it. This could potentially lead to denial-of-service attacks or other security issues.

Reasoning for each sink:

1. The first sink is identified because it creates a new `ContentProviderHolder` object and sets its properties using API input parameters. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the content provider's behavior or access sensitive information.
2. The second sink is identified because it accesses a `ProcessRecord` object and calls the `appDiedLocked` method on it. This could potentially lead to denial-of-service attacks or other security issues.

Note that the ranking of sinks may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the Android API and its usage.
