Based on the provided Java code for the `restartUserInBackground` API, I have identified two potential sinks that require access control. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var6 = var3.restartUser(param2,0);",
      "UserController$3 var4 = new UserController$3();",
      "int var9 = stopUser(param2,1,0,var4);"
    ],
    [
      "Object var52 = this.mLock;",
      "int var54 = stopUsersLU(param2,param3,param4,param5);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

**Sink 1:**
The first sink involves the `restartUser` method invocation, which has high naming similarity with the API name `restartUserInBackground`. The `restartUser` method takes the input parameter `param2` as an argument. Additionally, a new `UserController$3` object is created and used in conjunction with the `stopUser` method, which also processes the input parameters.

**Sink 2:**
The second sink involves the access to the `mLock` field, which has naming similarity with the API name `restartUserInBackground`. Although this field access does not directly process any input parameters, it is used in conjunction with the `stopUsersLU` method, which processes multiple input parameters.

**Ranking:**
I rank Sink 1 as more sensitive than Sink 2 because it involves a method invocation that directly processes input parameters and creates a new object. Sink 2, on the other hand, only involves field access and does not directly process any input parameters.

Note that both sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

* Sink 1 follows rule 1 (method invoked with naming similarity to the API name) and rule 4 (creation of a new object with data flow from the API parameters).
* Sink 2 follows rule 3 (field access with naming similarity to the API name).
