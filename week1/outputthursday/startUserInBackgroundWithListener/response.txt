Based on the provided Java code, I have identified two potential sinks that require access control.

**Sink 1:**

```json
{
"Sinks": [
[
"UserController var4 = this.mUserController;",
"boolean var7 = var4.startUser(param2,0,param3);",
"UserController$Injector var78 = this.mInjector;",
"var78.clearAllLockedTasks(startUser);"
]
]
}
```

**Ranking:** High sensitivity

**Reasoning:**

This sink involves the `startUser` method being invoked on the `UserController` object, which takes the input parameters `param2` and `param3`. The method name has high naming similarity with the API name `startUserInBackgroundWithListener`, indicating that this instruction is likely to be a critical part of the API's functionality. Additionally, the `clearAllLockedTasks` method is invoked on the `UserController$Injector` object, which may have security implications.

**Sink 2:**

```json
{
"Sinks": [
[
"UserState var140 = new UserState();",
"ProgressReporter var144 = var140.mUnlockProgress;",
"UserController$UserProgressListener var145 = new UserController$UserProgressListener();",
"var144.addListener(var145);"
]
]
}
```

**Ranking:** Medium sensitivity

**Reasoning:**

This sink involves the creation of a new `UserState` object and the addition of a listener to its progress reporter. The object is created using data flow from the input parameter `param2`, which may indicate that this instruction is processing sensitive user information. However, the exact security implications are less clear compared to Sink 1.

Note that there are other instructions in the code snippet that may be considered auxiliary operations (e.g., logging, obtaining instance of a class) and therefore do not contribute to a sink.
