Your task is to assign Access Control to a new android method listed below. I will provide you with the original APIs code and the other similar APIs with their ground truth Access Control.

Given this information, your task is to assign an access control to the original_method API. After the explanation, give the final access control level for the API in JSON format as follows:

{ "access_control_level": "..." }.

You have 4 choices: NONE, NORMAL, DANGEROUS, SYS_OR_SIG. To make an informed decision, carefully review other APIs (ground truth) that I have provided above that interact with the same sinks, their assigned access control levels, and the semantics of those APIs.
