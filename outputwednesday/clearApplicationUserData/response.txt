Based on the provided Java code for the Android API `clearApplicationUserData`, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "int var16 = var12.handleIncomingUser(var11, var9, param5, 0, 2, clearApplicationUserData, 0);",
      "PackageManagerInternal var26 = getPackageManagerInternalLocked();",
      "boolean var28 = var26.isPackageDataProtected(var16, param2);",
      "forceStopPackageLocked(param2, var107, clear data);"
    ],
    [
      "IPackageManager var20 = AppGlobals.getPackageManager();",
      "ApplicationInfo var42 = var20.getApplicationInfo(param2, 8192, var16);",
      "int var47 = var45.uid;"
    ],
    [
      "ProcessList var86 = this.mProcessList;",
      "boolean var107 = var86.killPackageProcessesLocked(param2, var29, param9, -10000, param4, 1, param6, param7, 1, var105);"
    ],
    [
      "AppErrors var79 = this.mAppErrors;",
      "var79.resetProcessCrashTimeLocked(var80, var29, param9);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink is the most sensitive as it involves handling incoming user requests, checking package data protection, and forcing a package to stop.
2. The second sink is moderately sensitive as it retrieves application information and accesses the UID of an application.
3. The third sink is less sensitive as it kills package processes, but this operation is still critical for system security.
4. The fourth sink is the least sensitive as it resets process crash times, which is more related to error handling than access control.

Reasoning:

* The `handleIncomingUser` method and `isPackageDataProtected` check are critical for ensuring that only authorized users can clear application user data.
* The `forceStopPackageLocked` method is a sink because it takes action on the package based on the input parameters, which could be malicious if not properly validated.
* The `getPackageManagerInternalLocked` and `getApplicationInfo` methods are sinks because they provide sensitive information about packages and applications.
* The `killPackageProcessesLocked` method is a sink because it takes action on package processes, which could be malicious if not properly validated.
* The `resetProcessCrashTimeLocked` method is less critical but still a sink because it updates process crash times, which could be used to infer sensitive information about system crashes.
