After analyzing the provided Java code for the `finishReceiver` API, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output with the identified sinks:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "param2.receiver = 0;",
      "Intent var82 = param2.intent;",
      "Intent var84 = var82.setComponent(0);",
      "ProcessRecord var85 = param2.curApp;",
      "ProcessRecord var86 = param2.curApp;",
      "ArraySet var87 = var86.curReceivers;",
      "boolean var89 = var87.contains(param2);",
      "ProcessRecord var90 = param2.curApp;",
      "ArraySet var91 = var90.curReceivers;",
      "boolean var93 = var91.remove(param2);"
    ],
    [
      "BroadcastFilter var97 = param2.curFilter;",
      "BroadcastFilter var98 = param2.curFilter;",
      "ReceiverList var99 = var98.receiverList;",
      "var99.curBroadcast = 0;"
    ],
    [
      "param2.curFilter = 0;",
      "param2.curReceiver = 0;",
      "param2.curApp = 0;",
      "this.mPendingBroadcast = 0;"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind each identified sink:

1. The first sink involves updating the `receiver` field of the `param2` object and modifying its associated intent, app, and receiver lists. This is a sensitive operation as it affects the state of the broadcast receiver.
2. The second sink involves updating the `curBroadcast` field of the `ReceiverList` object associated with the `param2.curFilter`. This is also a sensitive operation as it affects the state of the broadcast filter.
3. The third sink involves resetting several fields of the `param2` object, including `curFilter`, `curReceiver`, and `curApp`, as well as setting `this.mPendingBroadcast` to 0. This is a sensitive operation as it resets the state of the broadcast receiver and pending broadcasts.

Ranking these sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink ( updating `receiver` field and modifying intent, app, and receiver lists)
2. The second sink (updating `curBroadcast` field of `ReceiverList`)
3. The third sink (resetting fields of `param2` object and pending broadcasts)

Note that these sinks follow at least one of the positive rules:

* Method invocations with naming similarity to the API name (`finishReceiverLocked`, `removeAllowBackgroundActivityStartsToken`)
* Field get cases with naming similarity to the API name (`curFilter`, `curReceiver`, `curApp`)
* Field set cases with modification using API parameters (`receiver`, `intent`, `app`)
