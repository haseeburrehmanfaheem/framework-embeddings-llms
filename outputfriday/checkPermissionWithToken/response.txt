After analyzing the provided Java code, I did not find any potential sinks that require access control. The method `checkPermissionWithToken` is empty and does not contain any instructions that collectively contribute to a sink.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sinks": []
}
```

Reasoning:
The method `checkPermissionWithToken` only contains an integer declaration with a value of -1, but it does not perform any operations or interact with other data. It does not meet any of the positive rules for identifying potential sinks.

Note that if this method were to be used in conjunction with other methods or had additional code added to it, it could potentially become a sink. However, based on the provided code snippet, there are no potential sinks identified.
