Based on the provided Java code for the `handleApplicationStrictModeViolation` method, I have identified potential sinks that require access control. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "var52.obj = var54;",
      "Handler var65 = this.mUiHandler;",
      "boolean var67 = var65.sendMessage(var52);"
    ],
    [
      "AppErrorResult var46 = new AppErrorResult();",
      "int var80 = var46.get();"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive, I would place the first sink at the top. Here's my reasoning:

**Sink 1:**

* The `sendMessage` method is invoked on a `Handler` object (`mUiHandler`) with a `Message` object (`var52`) as an argument.
* The `Message` object contains a `HashMap` (`var54`) that holds sensitive information, including the `AppErrorResult` object (`var46`), the `ProcessRecord` object (`var7`), and other data.
* This sink is ranked highest in sensitivity because it involves sending a message with potentially sensitive data to a handler, which could be exploited by an attacker.

**Sink 2:**

* A new `AppErrorResult` object (`var46`) is created and its `get()` method is invoked to retrieve a value.
* Although this sink involves accessing a sensitive object, it is ranked lower in sensitivity compared to the first sink because it does not involve sending data to an external handler.

The following code instructions were considered but ultimately excluded from the list of sinks:

* `ProcessRecord var7 = findAppProcess(param2,StrictMode);`: This line is an auxiliary operation that obtains a `ProcessRecord` object and is not considered a sink.
* `Integer var14 = Integer.valueOf(var12);`: This line creates an `Integer` object but does not involve sending data to an external handler or accessing sensitive information.
* `ActivityManagerService.boostPriorityForLockedSection();` and `ActivityManagerService.resetPriorityAfterLockedSection();`: These lines are auxiliary operations that manage thread priority and are not considered sinks.

Note that the sensitivity ranking is subjective and may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the system.
