After analyzing the provided Java code for the `handleApplicationCrash` method, I have identified several potential sinks that require access control. Here is the list of sinks in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sinks": [
    [
      "Object var7 = new Object(8);",
      "Integer var11 = Integer.valueOf(var9);",
      "arraystore 7[12] = 11;",
      "Integer var18 = Integer.valueOf(var16);",
      "arraystore 7[19] = 18;",
      "arraystore 7[20] = 4;",
      "Integer var26 = Integer.valueOf(var24);",
      "arraystore 7[27] = 26;",
      "String var29 = param5.exceptionClassName;",
      "arraystore 7[28] = 29;",
      "String var31 = param5.exceptionMessage;",
      "arraystore 7[30] = 31;",
      "String var33 = param5.throwFileName;",
      "arraystore 7[32] = 33;",
      "Integer var37 = Integer.valueOf(var35);",
      "arraystore 7[34] = 37;"
    ],
    [
      "addErrorToDropBox(param2,param3,param4,0,0,0,0,0,0,param5);"
    ],
    [
      "IBinder var14 = ServiceManager.getService(dropbox);",
      "Context var16 = this.mContext;",
      "Object var19 = var16.getSystemService(var17);",
      "DropBoxManager var20 = (DropBoxManager) var19;"
    ],
    [
      "String var24 = ActivityManagerService.processClass(param3);",
      "boolean var35 = var20.isTagEnabled(var33);"
    ],
    [
      "this.mWtfClusterStart = var37;",
      "this.mWtfClusterCount = 1;"
    ],
    [
      "appendDropBoxProcessHeaders(param3,param4,var49);"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Ranking the sinks from most sensitive to least sensitive:

1. The first sink (array of instructions) is the most sensitive as it involves creating a new object and storing sensitive information such as calling PID, UID, exception class name, exception message, throw file name, and throw line number.
2. The second sink (`addErrorToDropBox`) is also highly sensitive as it adds error information to the drop box, which may contain sensitive data.
3. The third sink (array of instructions related to `ServiceManager` and `Context`) is moderately sensitive as it involves accessing system services and context objects.
4. The fourth sink (array of instructions related to `ActivityManagerService` and `DropBoxManager`) is moderately sensitive as it involves processing crash information and checking tag enablement.
5. The fifth sink (`this.mWtfClusterStart = var37;` and `this.mWtfClusterCount = 1;`) is less sensitive as it only updates internal state variables.
6. The sixth sink (`appendDropBoxProcessHeaders`) is the least sensitive as it only appends process headers to the drop box.

Note that the sensitivity ranking may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements of the system.
